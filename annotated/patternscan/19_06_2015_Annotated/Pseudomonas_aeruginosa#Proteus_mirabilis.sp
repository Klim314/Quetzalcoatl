TI  == observations on the current bacteriological profile of chronic suppurative otitis media in south eastern nigeria.
AB  == background: chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) is a disease well-known for its recurrence and persistence despite treatment. the situation is compounded by  the increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents by bacteria these days. aim: this study was carried out to examine the current local bacteriological profile of csom and to compare the profile of either ear in bilaterally discharging ears. materials and methods: we carried out a retrospective analysis of ear swab cultures from 133 unilateral and 73 bilateral consecutive tubotympanic csom cases seen at the ear-nose-throat clinics of a referral health institution during a 4 year period ending 2013. sensitivities to eight locally available antibiotics were analyzed. aerobic bacterial isolates were analyzed separately for the unilateral and bilateral cases. comparison was made between the ears in the bilateral cases. results: we analyzed 279 ear swab culture results from 206 patients with age ranging from 5 months to 86 years and a mean of 21.3 (19.5) years. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolated bacteria (44% [109/250]) followed by staphylococcus aureus (17% [42/250]), and proteus mirabilis (15% [38/250]). the most and least sensitive bacteria were klebsiella spp and escherichia coli, respectively. the most effective antibiotics were gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. the two ears differ significantly in the rates of isolation of s. aureus and e. coli (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). conclusion: pseudomonas is the most common bacteria involved in csom in this part of the country. ciprofloxacin as ear drops is recommended as first-line drug in the management of active csom as it is cheap, less ototoxic, and locally available. separate ear swab culture should be obtained in bilateral csom.

TI  == colonization, competition, and dispersal of pathogens in fluid flow networks.
AB  == the colonization of bacteria in complex fluid flow networks, such as those found  in host vasculature, remains poorly understood. recently, it was reported that many bacteria, including bacillus subtilis [1], escherichia coli [2], and pseudomonas aeruginosa [3, 4], can move in the opposite direction of fluid flow.  upstream movement results from the interplay between fluid shear stress and bacterial motility structures, and such rheotactic-like behavior is predicted to  occur for a wide range of conditions [1]. given the potential ubiquity of upstream movement, its impact on population-level behaviors within hosts could be significant. here, we find that p. aeruginosa communities use a diverse set of motility strategies, including a novel surface-motility mechanism characterized by counter-advection and transverse diffusion, to rapidly disperse throughout vasculature-like flow networks. these motility modalities give p. aeruginosa a selective growth advantage, enabling it to self-segregate from other human pathogens such as proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus that outcompete p.  aeruginosa in well-mixed non-flow environments. we develop a quantitative model of bacterial colonization in flow networks, confirm our model in vivo in plant vasculature, and validate a key prediction that colonization and dispersal can be inhibited by modifying surface chemistry. our results show that the interaction between flow mechanics and motility structures shapes the formation of mixed-species communities and suggest a general mechanism by which bacteria could colonize hosts. furthermore, our results suggest novel strategies for tuning the  composition of multi-species bacterial communities in hosts, preventing inappropriate colonization in medical devices, and combatting bacterial infections.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial activities of minocycline and rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces in an in vitro urinary system model.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial activity in urinary catheters and silicones in antibiotic-coated prosthetic urinary systems in order to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by catheter-associated infection. methods: the study was initiated in 1993 at houston, usa and continued in turkey till 1996. a  sterileplastic bag was used as kidney in the in vitro urinary system. physiological renal jet streams (50 cc/h) were generated with an intravenous metric pump. the temperature was kept at body temperature. the bladder drainage was achieved at the physiological drainage period of 4-6 hours during the 72-hour experiment. silicone surfaces coated with pure silicone and impregnated with minocycline-rifampin were exposed to the urine contaminated with the targeted bacteria in the in vitro urinary model for 72 hours. antimicrobial activities occurring in the eosin methylene blue and blood agar media in the infected silicones were assessed. results: minocycline-rifampin silicone surfaces exposed  to the urine contaminated with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa reported reproduction. no reproduction was observed in the culture of minocycline- rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces for proteus mirabilis.the difference with the control group was regarded as statistically significant for proteus mirabilis (p < 0.005). minocycline-rifampin-coated silicones were closely monitored only for proteus mirabilis in the in vitro urinary medium. although inhibition zones (< 10 mm) in the cultures were observed for minocycline-rifampin-coated silicones for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the microbial efficacy was not regarded sufficient. conclusion: there is still need for evidence-based in vivo and in vitro studies where antimicrobial activity is evaluated on the surface of catheters.

TI  == polyphenolic extract from maple syrup potentiates antibiotic susceptibility and reduces biofilm formation of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic compounds are believed to be promising candidates as complementary therapeutics. maple syrup, prepared by concentrating the sap from the north american maple tree, is a rich source of natural and process-derived phenolic compounds. in this work, we report the antimicrobial activity of a phenolic-rich  maple syrup extract (prmse). prmse exhibited antimicrobial activity as well as strong synergistic interaction with selected antibiotics against gram-negative clinical strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among the phenolic constituents of prmse, catechol exhibited strong synergy with antibiotics as well as with other phenolic components of prmse against bacterial growth. at sublethal concentrations, prmse and catechol efficiently reduced biofilm formation and increased the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics. in an effort to elucidate the mechanism for the observed synergy with antibiotics, prmse was found to increase outer membrane permeability of all bacterial strains and effectively inhibit efflux pump activity. furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that prmse significantly repressed multiple-drug resistance genes as well as genes associated with motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. overall, this study provides a proof of concept and starting point for investigating the molecular mechanism of the reported increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in the  presence of prmse.

TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == propagation capacity of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates using a luciferase reporter system.
AB  == introduction: currently the use of molecular tools and techniques of genetic engineering in the study of microbial behavior in blood components has replaced the employment of classical methods of microbiology. this work focuses on the use of a novel lux reporter system for monitoring the contaminating propagation capacity of bacteria present in platelet concentrates under standard storage conditions in the blood bank. methods: a minitn5 promotor probe carrying the lux  operon from photorhabdus luminiscens (putminitn5luxcdabekm2) was used to construct four bacterial bioluminescent mutants: escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. luminescent mutants were used for contamination tests with 20 cfu in platelet concentrates bags and were stored under standard storage conditions in the blood bank (100 rpm at 22 degrees c). the measurements of luminous activity and optical density were used to monitor bacterial proliferation during 7 days (168 h). results: during the exponential growth phase (log) of bacterial strains, a lineal correlation between luminous activity vs biomass was observed (r(2) = 0.985, 0.976, 0.981) for e. coli::tn5luxcdabekm2, p. mirabilis::tn5luxcdabekm2 and p. auriginosa::tn5luxcdabekm2, respectively. the above indicates that metabolic activity (production of atp) is directly related to biomass in this phase of microbial growth. while conducting experiments, the inability to propagate s. typhi::tn5luxcdabekm2 was detected. we can speculate that platelet concentrates contain specific components that prevent the propagation of s. typhi. conclusion: the use of luxcdabe system for the quantification of luminous activity is a rapid and sensitive alternative to study the propagation and auto-sterilization of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates.

TI  == antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
AB  == purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and  fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the  complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  == chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. it is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. the purpose of this study was to identify the  bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. a number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. the isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), proteus mirabilis (1), citrobacter freundii (1), group g beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). in comparison to the other isolates, p. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by s. aureus, with insignificant differences between mrsa and non-methicillin resistant isolates. the enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. the isolation of mrsa, esbl-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant p. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. this study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. however, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.

TI  == preparation and characterization of new biologically active polyurethane foams.
AB  == biologically active polyurethane foams are the fast-developed alternative to many applications of biomedical materials. due to the polyurethane structure features  and foam technology it is possible to incorporate into their structure the biologically active compounds of target purpose via structural-chemical modification of macromolecule. a series of new biologically active polyurethane foams (pufs) was synthesized with polyethers (mm 2500-5000), polyesters mm (500-2200), 2,4(2,6) toluene diisocyanate, water as a foaming agent, catalysts, foam stabilizers and functional compounds. different functional compounds: 1,4-di-n-oxy-2,3-bis-(oxymethyl)-quinoxaline (domq), partial sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) and 2,6-dimethyl-n,n-diethyl aminoacetatanilide hydrochloride  were incorporated into the polymer structure/composition due to the chemical and/or physical bonding. structural peculiarities of pufs were studied by ftir spectroscopy and x-ray scattering. self-adhesion properties of pufs were estimated by measuring of tensile strength at break of adhesive junction. the optical microscopy method was performed for the puf morphology studies. toxicological estimation of the pufs was carried out in vitro and in vivo. the antibacterial action towards the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atc 25922, e. coli atc 2150, klebsiella pneumoniae 6447, staphylococcus aureus 180, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8180, proteus mirabilis f 403,  p. mirabilis 6054, and proteus vulgaris 8718) was studied by the disc method on the solid nutrient. physic-chemical properties of the pufs (density, tensile strength and elongation at break, water absorption and vapor permeability) showed that all studied pufs are within the operational requirements for such materials  and represent fine-cellular foams. spectral studies confirmed the incorporation of domq into the puf's macrochain. pufs are characterized by microheterogeneous structure. they are antibacterially active, non-toxic materials with high affinity to the tissue body, self-adhesive properties and local anesthetic effect.

AB  == microorganisms from a patient or their environment may colonize indwelling urinary catheters, forming biofilm communities on catheter surfaces and increasing patient morbidity and mortality. this study investigated the effect of pretreating hydrogel-coated silicone catheters with mixtures of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis bacteriophages on the development of single- and two-species biofilms in a multiday continuous-flow in vitro model using artificial urine. novel phages were purified from sewage, characterized, and screened for their abilities to reduce biofilm development by clinical isolates of their respective hosts. our screening data showed that artificial urine medium (aum) is a valid substitute for human urine for the purpose of evaluating uropathogen biofilm control by these bacteriophages. defined phage cocktails targeting p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis were designed based on the biofilm inhibition screens. hydrogel-coated catheters were pretreated with one or both cocktails and challenged with approximately 1x10(3) cfu/ml of the corresponding pathogen(s). the biofilm growth on the catheter surfaces in aum was monitored over 72 to 96 h. phage pretreatment reduced p. aeruginosa biofilm counts by 4 log10 cfu/cm2 (p</=0.01) and p. mirabilis biofilm counts by >2 log10 cfu/cm2 (p</=0.01) over 48 h. the presence of p. mirabilis was always associated with an  increase in lumen ph from 7.5 to 9.5 and with eventual blockage of the reactor lines. the results of this study suggest that pretreatment of a hydrogel urinary  catheter with a phage cocktail can significantly reduce mixed-species biofilm formation by clinically relevant bacteria.

TI  == flow cytometry analysis using sysmex uf-1000i classifies uropathogens based on bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens among patients with urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are the second most common bacterial infection. urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but new techniques, such as flow cytometry analysis (fca), have been introduced. the aim of the present study was to evaluate fca characteristics regarding bacteriuria, leukocyturia, and erythrocyturia in relation to cultured uropathogens in specimens from patients with a suspected uti. we also wanted to evaluate whether the fca characteristics  can identify uropathogens prior to culture. from a prospective study, 1,587 consecutive urine specimens underwent fca prior to culture during january and february 2012. outpatients and inpatients (79.6% and 19.4%, respectively) were included, of whom women represented 67.5%. in total, 620 specimens yielded growth, of which escherichia coli represented 65%, enterococcus spp. 8%, klebsiella spp. 7%, and staphylococcus spp. 5%. for the uropathogens, the outcome of fca was compared against the results for specimens with e. coli and those with a negative culture. e. coli had high bacterial (median, 17,914/mul), leukocyte (median, 348/mul), and erythrocyte (median, 23/mul) counts. with the exception of klebsiella spp., the majority of the uropathogens had considerable or significantly lower bacterial counts than that of e. coli. high leukocyte counts  were found in specimens with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group c streptococci. elevated erythrocyte counts were found for p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, and group c streptococci, as well as for staphylococcus saprophyticus. in essence, fca adds new information about the  bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens for different uropathogens. based on fca characteristics, uropathogens can be classified and identified prior to culture. e. coli and klebsiella spp. have similar fca characteristics.

TI  == wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  == microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. these microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. the use of natural products  has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. the present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. four gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of russula delica, fistulina hepatica, mycena rosea, leucopaxilus giganteus, and lepista nuda extracts. the results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). among the five tested extracts against e. coli, leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. the extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon p. mirabilis biofilm formation were sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and russula delica (53.1%). acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by russula delica extract). this is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: what we know and what we should know.
AB  == individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. these chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. however, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the sci population has not been well characterized. this study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci. an electronic literature search of medline (1966 to february 2014) was performed. eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the sci population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly.  the most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. in  general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci is quite rudimentary, at best. well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == biofilms, flagella, and mechanosensing of surfaces by bacteria.
AB  == formation of a bacterial biofilm is a developmental process that begins when a cell attaches to a surface, but how does a bacterial cell know it is on or near a surface in the first place? the phase of this 'swim-or-stick' switch is determined by a sensory transduction mechanism referred to as surface sensing, which involves the rotating bacterial flagellum. this review explores six bacterial species as models of flagellar mechanosensing of surfaces to understand the current state of our knowledge and the challenges that lie ahead. a common link between these bacteria is a requirement for the proper function of the flagellar motor stators that channel ions into the cell to drive flagellar rotation. conditions that affect ion flow act as a signal that, ultimately, controls the master transcriptional regulatory circuits controlling the flagellar hierarchy and biofilm formation.

TI  == a survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  == objectives: to learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (bhr) inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern china. methods: a multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids was developed and used to determine these bhr plasmids. the difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (mdro) and non-mdro were assessed using a chi-square test. results: the average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for incn, incp, incq, incw, and inca/c in descending order. the distribution of all five bhr plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. the prevalence rates of all five bhr plasmids in mdros were significantly higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb). conclusions: bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. the prevalence rates in mdro are higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for nfgnb.

TI  == antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  == background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k.  pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed  in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == a comparison of inpatient versus outpatient resistance patterns of pediatric urinary tract infection.
AB  == purpose: prior single center studies showed that antibiotic resistance patterns differ between outpatients and inpatients. we compared antibiotic resistance patterns for urinary tract infection between outpatients and inpatients on a national level. materials and methods: we examined outpatient and inpatient urinary isolates from children younger than 18 years using the surveillance network (eurofins scientific, luxembourg, luxembourg), a database of antibiotic susceptibility results, as well as patient demographic data from 195 american hospitals. we determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of the 6 most common uropathogens, including escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. we compared differences in uropathogen prevalence and resistance patterns for outpatient and  inpatient isolates using chi-square analysis. results: we identified 25,418 outpatient (86% female) and 5,560 inpatient (63% female) urinary isolates. escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen overall but its prevalence varied by gender and visit setting, that is 79% of uropathogens overall for outpatient isolates, including 83% of females and 50% of males, compared to 54% for overall inpatient isolates, including 64% of females and 37% of males (p <0.001). uropathogen resistance to many antibiotics was lower in the outpatient vs inpatient setting, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 24% vs 30% and cephalothin 16% vs 22% for e. coli (each p <0.001), cephalothin 7% vs 14% for klebsiella (p = 0.03), ceftriaxone 12% vs 24% and ceftazidime 15% vs 33% for enterobacter (each p <0.001), and ampicillin 3% vs 13% and ciprofloxacin 5% vs 12% for enterococcus (each p <0.001). conclusions: uropathogen resistance rates of several antibiotics are higher for urinary specimens obtained from inpatients  vs outpatients. separate outpatient vs inpatient based antibiograms can aid in empirical prescribing for pediatric urinary tract infections.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == mycosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles and their activity against some human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to biosynthesis silver nanoparticles from the fungus nigrospora sphaerica isolated from soil samples and to examine their activity against five human pathogenic strains of bacteria viz. escherichia coli, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion method. the synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with commonly used antibiotic gentamycin against the selected bacteria was also examined. the synthesized silver nanoparticles from free-cell filtrate were characterized by using uv-vis spectrophotometer analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and scanning electron microscope (sem). uv-vis spectrophotometer analysis showed a peak at 420 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, ftir analysis verified the detection of protein capping of silver nanoparticles while sem micrographs revealed that the silver nanoparticles are dispersed and aggregated and mostly having spherical shape within the size range between 20 and 70 nm. the synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited a varied growth inhibition activity (15-26 mm diam inhibition zones) against the tested pathogenic bacteria. a remarkable increase of bacterial growth inhibition (26-34 mm diam) was detected when a combination of silver nanoparticles and gentamycin was used. a significant increase in fold area of antibacterial activity was observed when agnps in combination with gentamycin  was applied. the synthesized silver nanoparticles produced by the fungus n. sphaerica is a promising to be used as safe drug in medical therapy due to their  broad spectrum against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact  of patient risk factors on susceptibility.
AB  == background: traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. the aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and  to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility. methods:  this retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from january 1 to december 31, 2012. a urinary antibiogram specific for escherichia coli (ec), proteus mirabilis (pm), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) was developed. urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities  were compared. urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for </=30 days, hospitalization for </=30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. results: there were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (kp, 14% vs 7% [p = .001]; ec, 13% vs 9% [p < .001]; pm, 18% vs 10% [p = .004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for ec and pm. conclusions: using a  syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility  data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == the need for culture swabs in laparoscopically treated appendicitis.
AB  == introduction: appendicitis remains the most common cause of an acute abdomen. obtaining intra-abdominal cultures is routine surgical practice. there are studies showing no efficacy of such procedures in cases where open appendectomies are performed. aim: the goal of this study was to assess the need for obtaining intra-abdominal cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies. material and methods: between 2007 and 2012, 369 patients were operated on with the diagnosis  of histopathologically proven acute appendicitis. sixty-two percent of them were  operated on using laparoscopic techniques. the microbiological assessment was routinely done for the open procedures and in 42% of cases that underwent a laparoscopic operation. results: in 57% (134) the swabbing results were negative. among 43% (102) of the patients with a positive result, escherichia coli was isolated in 76.5% (78), proteus mirabilis in 13.7% (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 4.9% (5) and citrobacter freundii in 4.9% (5). five cases had bacteria resistant to the antibiotic given preoperatively (that is 4.9% of all positive cultures and 1.4% of all operated patients). however, these cases did not affect  the incidence of postoperative complications. consideration of the postoperative  morbidity showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the laparoscopic group with and without intra-operative swabbing (p > 0.05). conclusions: the postoperative patient outcome was more dependent on the pathology of the appendix than on the results of the microbiological assessment at the time of surgery. hence, routine intra-operative cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies appear to have little value in patient management. swabbing during laparoscopic procedures should be limited to only selected high-risk groups.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of isolates from paediatric intensive care units in zagreb.
AB  == aim: meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. results of the six years period (2002-2007) for the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other  broad-spectrum agents against gram-negative and gram-positive isolates collected  at pediatric intensive care units of the university hospital center zagreb in croatia were reported. methods: a total of 110 gram-negative and 43 gram-positive pathogens from pediatric specimens were tested. the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi. results: there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and gentamicin (50%) are a raising concern. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant gram-negative species with two (12%) of the strains resistant to meropenem, three (18%) to imipenem, 10 (47%) to gentamicin and six (35%) to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria in pediatric population. conclusions: the results indicate that meropenem has excellent potency and spectrum of activity despite being prescribed for a long time for the treatment of seriously ill patients, and still appears to be a reliable option for the initial empirical therapy of serious nosocomial infections in children. however, later studies have shown the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria after 2008.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in united states and european hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  == treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by gram-negative organisms. rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the icu can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in icus (icu patients). the isolates were consecutively collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program  from january 2009 to december 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from icu patients (3445 from the united states [usa] and 2544 from europe [eu]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-icu patients (9271 from usa and 7973 from eu). escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from icu patients, followed by enterobacter spp., serratia spp., haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., and proteus mirabilis. susceptibility rates were generally lower among icu isolates compared to non-icu organisms. e. coli isolates from icu patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype rates (13.7% in usa and 16.6% in eu); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/ml), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against klebsiella spp. esbl-phenotype rates have increased among both e. coli and klebsiella spp. from icu patients in the usa and in europe, with the  most noticeable increase among klebsiella spp. from europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; p = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). meropenem susceptibility among klebsiella spp. improved slightly in  the usa but decreased markedly in europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in usa and 84.9% in eu) exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa strains from icu patients. the greatest differences in susceptibility rates between p. aeruginosa strains from icu and non-icu patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. the results of this  study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for usa and eu icu patient isolates.

TI  == [one-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for mrsa isolated in eight medical facilities in kumamoto prefecture].
AB  == to investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except mrsa) in kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-escherichia coli, esbl-klebsiella species, esbl-proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant enterococcii in eight general hospitals from may in 2009 to april in 2010. esbl-e. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant p. aeruginosa came second. the isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase,  while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant p. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals.  however, the isolation numbers of esbl-klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant p.  aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred  from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of geranium oil against gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  == hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. they can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the  risk of their emergence. diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of  geranium oil against gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. the constituents  of geranium oil were specified by gc-fid-ms analysis. the micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. the tested geranium oil was efficacious against gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. the results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.

TI  == inhibition of biofilm development of uropathogens by curcumin - an anti-quorum sensing agent from curcuma longa.
AB  == urinary tract infection is caused primarily by the quorum sensing (qs)-dependent  biofilm forming ability of uropathogens. in the present investigation, an anti-quorum sensing (anti-qs) agent curcumin from curcuma longa (turmeric) was shown to inhibit the biofilm formation of uropathogens, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens, possibly  by interfering with their qs systems. the antibiofilm potential of curcumin on uropathogens as well as its efficacy in disturbing the mature biofilms was examined under light microscope and confocal laser scanning microscope. the treatment with curcumin was also found to attenuate the qs-dependent factors, such as exopolysaccharide production, alginate production, swimming and swarming  motility of uropathogens. furthermore, it was documented that curcumin enhanced the susceptibility of a marker strain and uropathogens to conventional antibiotics.

TI  == autocatalytic growth of biofunctionalized antibacterial silver nanoparticles.
AB  == development of eco-friendly processes for nanosynthesis is gaining importance owing to the widespread application of nanoparticles (nps). in the present study, we have explained the mechanism and kinetics of bioreduction in the biosynthesis  of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using aqueous leaf extract of rhizophora apiculata. spectrophotometric methods were employed to quantify the bioactive molecules present before and after the reduction process. the results showed that the polyphenols were the main components responsible for the biosynthesis of agnps, which was further confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the kinetics of formation of agnps were monitored by time-resolved spectrophotometric and x-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that the np formation is an autocatalytic process with a rate constant of 1.9 x 10(-2) min(-1) . the nps were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques like ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. the biogenic agnps showed substantial inhibitory activity to proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus with minimum  inhibitory concentration values of 2.5, 12.5, 2.5, and 31.25 mug/ml, respectively. the current research provides an insight into the mechanistic aspects of bioreduction and formation of agnps.

TI  == class d beta-lactamases: a reappraisal after five decades.
AB  == despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. the major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. these enzymes can be grouped into four classes (a-d). among the most genetically diverse are the class d beta-lactamases. in this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). class d beta-lactamases are mostly found in gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa , escherichia coli , proteus mirabilis , and acinetobacter baumannii . the active-sites of class d beta-lactamases contain an unusual n-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. a strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with co2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. the carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. there are more  than 250 class d beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, esbls) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened  active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. more concerning are the class d beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class d carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. the rotational orientation of the c6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. inhibition of class d beta-lactamases is a current challenge. commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class d enzymes. on the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class d enzymes. several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is  distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. these studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class d inactivators.

AB  == rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency  control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. the in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16s rrna, a phylogenetic biomarker. the dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. with electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. the applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16s rrna sequences. the results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. from the clinical editor: urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms  is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. these investigators  demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.

TI  == convenient syntheses of cyanuric chloride-derived nhc ligands, their ag(i) and au(i) complexes and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == convenient syntheses of mono- and bis-imidazolium 1,3,5-triazine derivatives bearing piperidine and morpholine substituents are reported. in situ deprotonation of the mono-imidazolium salts and reaction with ag2o or au(tht)cl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) precursors affords the corresponding ag(nhc)cl and au(nhc)cl carbene complexes. in the presence of ag(i) or au(i) salts the bis-imidazolium pincers eliminate the imidazolium group to afford -ome or -nme2 substituted triazines depending on the solvent used. in solution, the ag(i) and au(i) complexes show a barrier to rotation about the ctriazine-namine bonds, with calculated deltag( not equal) barriers in the region of 70 kj mol(-1). single crystal x-ray structures of several of the proligands and their corresponding ag(i) and au(i) complexes were obtained. these universally reveal an extended, rigidly planar pi-conjugated network between the triazine core, imidazolium/imidazolylidene substituents and exocyclic amine functions, to which  the origin of the rotational barrier observed in solution is attributed. only very weak ntriazine-metal interactions are observed in the solid state, as indicated by small deviations of the cnhc-ag-cl bond angles from 180 degrees and  also supported by dft calculations on the ag(nhc)cl complex (nhc = 4,6-dipiperidinyl-2-methylimidazolylidene triazine). preliminary antimicrobial susceptibility studies against five microorganisms (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus nctc 13277, s. aureus nctc 6571, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662, proteus mirabilis nctc 11938 and candida albicans atcc 90028) show that the above triazine-based ag-nhc complexes are active antimicrobial and antifungal agents.

TI  == microorganisms' colonization and their antibiotic resistance pattern in oro - tracheal tube.
AB  == background and objectives: recently, nosocomial infections have been discussed as a critical issue among intubated patients leading to significant morbidity and mortality. hence, the pattern of microbiological colonization and antibiotic resistance are much valuable in this regard. we aimed to investigate the pattern  of microorganism colonization and antibiotic resistance in patients with endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to propose a proper empirical antibiotic therapy in this setting. materials and methods: this cross sectional study was conducted among 880 patients admitted in imam khomeini hospital between 2008 and  2011 who were subsequently intubated or underwent tracheostomy due to insufficient self ventilation. samples for microbiological cultures were obtained after extubation and then sent to the central laboratory for further assessment.  antibiograms and microbiological cultures were obtained for each sample. results: of 880 patients enrolled in this study, 531 (60.3%) were male and 349 (39.7%) were female. nineteen different organisms were isolated including acinetobacter (213, 24.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (147, 16.7%), staphylococcus aureus (106, 12%), proteus mirabilis (90, 10.2%), and other organisms (324, 36.8%). antibiotic resistance was mainly seen in acinetobacter (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidim, cefepim,  and penicillin), s. aureus (imipenem) and klebsiella (pipracillintazobactam and ampicillin-sulbactam). conclusion: this study represents the most common microorganisms colonizing tracheal tube of hospitalized patients and their pattern of antibiotic resistance. acinetobacter was the most common microorganism isolated from endotracheal tube. hence, it may be possible to initiate the empiric antibiotic treatment before the results of culture are become available.  ciprofloxacin was also the most prevalent antibiotic revealing resistant pattern. moreover, most of the microorganisms were sensitive to imipenem and pipracillin-tazobactam.

TI  == chronic otorrhoea: spectrum of microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivity in a south african cohort.
AB  == background: chronic otorrhoea is difficult to treat, with treatment in south africa (sa) being protocol driven and generally initiated at the primary healthcare level. there is a lack of local studies that focus on the bacteriology and antimicrobial sensitivities of chronic otorrhoea, which underpins the management advice offered. aims: to determine the microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility of patients with chronic otorrhoea and the validity  of the department of health's (doh) current guideline. methods: we conducted a prospective study at groote schuur hospital from 2005 to 2009. we included patients with chronic otorrhoea classified as either otitis media or otitis externa, according to our definitions. pus swabs were taken, from which microorganisms were cultured and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. results: of 79 patients with otorrhoea, 50 had otitis media, 21 had otitis externa and the condition was not determined in 8 patients. the most common organism isolated with otitis media was proteus mirabilis (18/50; 36%) and with otitis externa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (7/21; 33%). otorrhoea had a different microbial spectrum compared with international reports, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection in a single patient. the organisms isolated were susceptible mainly to fluoroquinolones (96%) and aminoglycosides (81%). conclusion: amoxicillin is a poor choice of antibiotic due to its low sensitivity, which calls into question the current doh guideline for otorrhoea. antimicrobial treatment protocols should be based on local data and be revisited from time to time. this study suggests that, should first-line treatment fail, an antibiotic with gram-negative cover, e.g. a topical fluoroquinolone, should be considered.

TI  == the joint in vitro action of polymyxin b and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three european countries.
AB  == background: canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. for topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. hypothesis/objectives: this study was conducted to elucidate the in  vitro activity of polymyxin b and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates  from three european countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. animals: seventeen strains of escherichia coli,  24 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in germany, france and italy. methods: drug activities  were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration. the potentiation of polymyxin b plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). an fici </=0.5 defined synergy. furthermore, geographical variations in the fici and mic were assessed by statistical analysis. results: bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different european countries, because there were no significant mic and fici variations (p > 0.05). as a single agent, polymyxin b had bactericidal activity against most e. coli and p. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against s. pseudintermedius strains. miconazole was bactericidal  against all staphylococcus strains. synergy was demonstrated against strains of e. coli and p. aeruginosa (fici = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against s. pseudintermedius strains (fici = 1.25). proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. conclusions and clinical importance: in vitro synergy of polymyxin b and miconazole against e. coli and p. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == outcomes in uk patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia and the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
AB  == purpose: there is lack of contemporary outcome data on patients with hospital-acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. we determined the risk factors for 7-day mortality and investigated the hypothesis that, compared with central venous catheter (cvc)-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic urinary tract infections (utis) were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. methods: from october 2007 to september 2008, demographical, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia. patients were followed until death, hospital discharge or recovery from infection. risk factors for 7-day mortality were determined and multivariate logistic regression was used to define the association between catheter-associated bacteraemic utis and likelihood of death. results: 559 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 437 patients. overall, there were 90 deaths (20.6%) at 7 days and 153 deaths (35.0%) at 30 days. among patients with catheter-associated bacteraemic utis, 7-day and 30-day mortalities  associated with each bacteraemic episode were 25/83 (30.1%) and 33/83 (39.8%), respectively. within this subgroup, the commonest isolates were escherichia coli, 36 (43.4%), proteus mirabilis, 11 (13.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 (10.8%).  there were 22 (26.5%) multiple drug-resistant isolates and, of the e coli infections, 6 (16.7%) were extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers. in univariate analysis, the variables found to have the strongest association with 7-day mortality were age, pitt score, charlson comorbidity index (cci), medical speciality and site of infection. compared with cvc-associated bacteraemic infections, there was a significant association between catheter-associated bacteraemic utis and 7-day mortality (or 4.16, 95% ci 1.86 to 9.33). after adjustment for age and cci, this association remained significant (or 2.90, 95% ci 1.19 to 7.07). conclusions: compared with cvc-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic utis were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. efforts to reduce these infections should be prioritised.

TI  == aetiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of urinary tract infections in the elderly: a 6-month study.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are a common cause of bacteraemia in the elderly  and are associated with a high probability of hospitalization. despite the impact of utis on health status and quality of life, a limited number of studies have evaluated their aetiology in this population. this study aimed to evaluate the microbial aetiology and pattern of susceptibility of bacteria causing utis in the elderly. for this purpose, a retrospective cohort study of elderly residents (n = 472, aged >65 years) in 14 nursing homes in milan (italy) and its province was performed. globally, 393 micro-organisms from 328 samples were isolated: escherichia coli was the most prevalent (44.8 %), followed by proteus mirabilis (20.4 %), providencia spp. (8.9 %), klebsiella spp. (6.4 %) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6 %). enterococci were the most frequently isolated gram-positive organisms (7.4 %). almost all enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, carbapenems and amikacin. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were  detected in 42.1 % of isolates. the most active antibiotics against p. aeruginosa were colistin, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. all gram-positive organisms  were susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid, and 90 % were susceptible to nitrofurantoin. fluoroquinolones showed a limited activity against all the tested micro-organisms. escherichia coli remains the major micro-organism responsible for utis in older people, although to a lesser extent than in a younger population. the high rates of resistance observed in this study make careful use  of antibiotics advisable to limit further development of resistance.

TI  == effects of different substituents on the crystal structures and antimicrobial activities of six ag(i) quinoline compounds.
AB  == the syntheses and single crystal x-ray structures of [ag(5-nitroquinoline)2]no3 (1), [ag(8-nitroquinoline)2]no3.h2o (2), [ag(6-methoxy-8-nitroquinoline)(no3)]n (3), [ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)(no3)]n (4), [ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)2]no3 (5), and [ag(6-quinolinecarboxylic acid)2]no3 (6) are described. as an alternative to solution chemistry, solid-state grinding could be used to prepare  compounds 1 and 3, but the preparation of 4 and 5 in this way failed. the ag(i) ions in the monomeric compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 are coordinated to two ligands via the nitrogen atoms of the quinoline rings, thereby forming a distorted linear coordination geometry with ag-n bond distances of 2.142(2)-2.336(2) a and n-ag-n  bond angles of 163.62(13) degrees -172.25(13) degrees . the 1d coordination polymers 3 and 4 contain ag(i) centers coordinating one ligand and two bridging nitrate groups, thereby forming a distorted trigonal planar coordination geometry with ag-n bond distances of 2.2700(14) and 2.224(5) a, ag-o bond distances of 2.261(4)-2.536(5) a, and n-ag-o bond angles of 115.23(5) degrees -155.56(5) degrees . hirshfeld surface analyses of compounds 1-6 are presented as d(norm) and curvedness maps. the d(norm) maps show different interaction sites around the ag(i) ions, i.e., ag...ag interactions and possible o-h...o, c-h...o, c-h...n, and c-h...c hydrogen bonds. curvedness maps are a good way of visualizing pi-pi stacking interactions between molecules. the antimicrobial activities of compounds 1, 2, and 6 were screened against 15 different multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and compared to the antimicrobial activities of the clinically used silver sulfadiazine (ss). compound 2 showed activity similar to ss against this set of test organisms, being active against all strains and having slightly better average silver efficiency than ss (5 vs 6 mug ag/ml). against the standard nonresistant bacterial strains of staphylococcus aureus , pseudomonas aeruginosa , proteus mirabilis , and streptococcus pyogenes , compound 1 performed better than silver  nitrate, with an average mic of 6 mug ag/ml versus 18 mug ag/ml for the reference agno3. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) analyses of compounds 3 and 6 in dmso/meoh confirm the two-coordinated ag(+) complexes in solution, and the results of the (1)h nmr titrations of dmso solutions of 5-nitroquinoline and  8-nitroquinoline with agno3 in dmso suggest that 5-nitroquinoline is more strongly coordinated to the silver ion.

TI  == study of photodynamic therapy in the control of isolated microorganisms from infected wounds--an in vitro study.
AB  == the effective treatment of infected wounds continues to be a serious challenge, mainly due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. photodynamic therapy (pdt) refers to the topical or systemic administration of a non-toxic, photosensitizing agent (ps), followed by irradiation with visible light of a suitable wavelength. the possibility of applying the pdt locally is what makes it so favorable to the treatment of infected wounds. the goal of this study was to evaluate the action of the pdt in the inactivation in vitro of microorganisms coming from infected wounds, using methylene blue (mb) and photodithazine (pdz) as the ps and comparing the efficacy of these two compounds for pdt on bacteria.  for the application of pdt, isolated microorganisms identified from material collected from wounds were suspended in a saline solution containing 10(6) viable cells/ml. each isolated microorganism was submitted to pdt with mb and with pdz in accordance with the following treatment groups: n/t--no treatment; t1--pdt with pdz; t2--pdt with mb; t3--irradiation without ps; t4--treatment with pdz without light; and t5--treatment with mb without light. as a light source, an led-based device was used (biopdi/irrad-lead 660), composed of 54 leds, each with 70 mw of power in the 660 nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum. each tray of 96 wells was irradiated with an intensity of 25 mw/cm(2) and a dose of light of 50 j/cm(3) for 33 min. all the tests were made in duplicate. it was then concluded that the pdt with pdz was capable of inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria samples, however it did not have the same effect on gram-negative bacteria, which showed growth greater than 100,000 cfu; the pdt with mb showed an effectiveness on gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, for it was able to inhibit bacterial growth in both cases.

TI  == antibiotic resistance patterns of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infections.
AB  == purpose: we characterize the current national patterns of antibiotic resistance of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infection. materials and methods: we examined outpatient urinary isolates from patients younger than 18 years in 2009  using the surveillance network(r), a database with antibiotic susceptibility results and patient demographic data from 195 united states hospitals. we determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns for the 6 most common uropathogens, ie escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. we compared differences in uropathogen prevalence between males and females using chi-square analysis. results: we identified 25,418 outpatient urinary isolates. e. coli was the most common uropathogen overall but the prevalence of e. coli was higher among females (83%) than males (50%, p <0.001). other common species among males were enterococcus (17%), p. mirabilis (11%) and klebsiella (10%). however, these uropathogens each accounted for 5% or less of female isolates (p <0.001). resistance among e. coli was highest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24%) but  lower for nitrofurantoin (less than 1%) and cephalothin (15%). compared to 2002 surveillance network data, e. coli resistance rates increased for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (from 23% to 31% in males and from 20% to 23% in females) and ciprofloxacin (from 1% to 10% and from 0.6% to 4%, respectively). conclusions: e. coli remains the most common pediatric uropathogen. although widely used, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a poor empirical choice for pediatric urinary tract infections in many areas due to high resistance rates. first-generation cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin are appropriate narrow-spectrum alternatives given their low resistance rates. local antibiograms should be used to assist with empirical urinary tract infection treatment.

TI  == flgm proteins from different bacteria exhibit different structural characteristics.
AB  == intrinsically disordered proteins (idps) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. the importance of idps in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous flgm proteins, a model class of idps. we have previously shown that the flgm protein from the thermophile aquifex aeolicus has more structure at a. aeolicus'  physiological temperature (85 degrees c) than is observed for the salmonella typhimurium flgm, suggesting that the disordered nature of flgm varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. in this work, we extend these studies to the flgm proteins from escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and bacillus subtilis. we demonstrate that the b. subtilis, e. coli, and s. typhimurium flgms exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the b. subtilis flgm is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. the  p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis flgm proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. the p. aeruginosa flgm appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the p. mirabilis flgm. these results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == antimicrobial lectin from schinus terebinthifolius leaf.
AB  == aims: schinus terebinthifolius leaves are used for treating human diseases caused by micro-organisms. this work reports the isolation, characterization and antimicrobial activity of s. terebinthifolius leaf lectin (stell). methods and results: the isolation procedure involved protein extraction with 0.15 mol l(-1)  nacl, filtration through activated charcoal and chromatography of the filtrate on a chitin column. stell is a 14-kda glycopeptide with haemagglutinating activity that is inhibited by n-acetyl-glucosamine, not affected by ions (ca(2+) and mg(2+)) and stable upon heating (30-100 degrees c) as well as over the ph 5.0-8.0. the antimicrobial effect of stell was evaluated by determining the minimal inhibitory (mic), bactericide (mbc) and fungicide (mfc) concentrations. lectin was active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and staphylococcus aureus. highest bacteriostatic and bactericide effects were detected for salm. enteritidis (mic: 0.45 mug ml(-1)) and staph. aureus (mbc: 7.18 mug ml(-1)), respectively. stell impaired the growth (mic: 6.5 mug ml(-1)) and survival (mfc:  26 mug ml(-1)) of candida albicans. conclusions: stell, a chitin-binding lectin,  purified in milligram quantities, showed antimicrobial activity against medically important bacteria and fungi. significance and impact of the study: stell can be  considered as a new biomaterial for potential antimicrobial applications.

TI  == the effect of copper(ii), iron(ii) sulphate, and vitamin c combinations on the weak antimicrobial activity of (+)-catechin against staphylococcus aureus and other microbes.
AB  == few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. copper(ii) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but not staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis or escherichia coli. attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, s. aureus and e. coli, with iron(ii) sulphate, iron(iii) chloride, and vitamin c, showed that iron(ii) enhanced (+)-catechin against s. aureus, but not e. coli; neither iron(iii) nor combined iron(ii) and copper(ii), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. vitamin c enhanced copper(ii) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(ii). catalase or edta added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced h(2)o(2)via the action of added metal(ii) ions. h(2)o(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(ii) mixtures and copper(ii) alone could account for the  principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as  well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(ii) against s. aureus. these novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(ii) or iron(ii) contents in certain crop protection and other products.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative clinical isolates.
AB  == fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are considered as first line drugs to treat infectious diseases. in order to find out useful fluoroquinolones, the antibiotic resistance of fluoroquinolones, namely, ofloxacin (ofl), ciprofloxacin (cip), norfloxacin (nrf), enoxacin (enx), pefloxacin (pfl) and levofloxacin (lvf) was investigated against ninety five clinical isolates that includes staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. in vitro activity of these isolates was carried out by agar dilution method. all staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to ofl at 2 mug/ml. about 6% isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be resistance to lvf and enx, 6% to cip, ofl and pfl and none of the isolates were resistant to lvf and enx. percentage resistance of p. aeruginosa was found to be 4.35% to cip, 7% to ofl and 2.2% to nrf, whereas 8.69% to enx, 0% to pfl and 17.4% to lvf, respectively. the present study provides the data about the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative bacteria and strongly recommends the rational and appropriate use of these antibiotics.

TI  == membrane interaction and secondary structure of de novo designed arginine-and tryptophan peptides with dual function.
AB  == cell-penetrating peptides and antimicrobial peptides are two classes of positively charged membrane active peptides with several properties in common. the challenge is to combine knowledge about the membrane interaction mechanisms and structural properties of the two classes to design peptides with membrane-specific actions, useful either as transporters of cargo or as antibacterial substances. membrane active peptides are commonly rich in arginine  and tryptophan. we have previously designed a series of arg/trp peptides and investigated how the position and number of tryptophans affect cellular uptake. here we explore the antimicrobial properties and the interaction with lipid model membranes of these peptides, using minimal inhibitory concentrations assay (mic), circular dichroism (cd) and linear dichroism (ld). the results show that the arg/trp peptides inhibit the growth of the two gram positive strains staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus pyogenes, with some individual variations depending on the position of the tryptophans. no inhibition of the gram negative strains proteus mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa was noticed. cd indicated that when bound to lipid vesicles one of the peptides forms an alpha-helical like structure, whereas the other five exhibited rather random coiled structures. ld indicated that all six peptides were somehow aligned parallel with the membrane surface. our results do not reveal any obvious connection between membrane interaction and antimicrobial effect for the studied  peptides. by contrast cell-penetrating properties can be coupled to both the secondary structure and the degree of order of the peptides.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the effect of plum juice on struvite calculus formation in vitro and to explore the effect of plum juice on urease-producing bacteria and urease activity. the compliance of available drugs is low for struvite calculus after surgical treatment and functional food may represent a good choice as an alternative therapy. materials and methods: antibacterial activity was assessed using a microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test. urease activity was determined by measuring ammonia production. struvite crystals were induced by proteus mirabilis in artificial urine with natural and ph-adjusted plum juice. the optical density (od)(600) and ph of artificial urine were examined, as well the shape and weights of crystals. results: natural plum juice showed an antibacterial effect on urease-producing bacteria, whereas the ph-adjusted juice  did not. a concentration-dependent inhibition on urease activity was found for both natural and ph-adjusted juice. natural plum juice at a high concentration of 0.5% showed an obvious inhibition on the increase of od(600) and ph of the artificial urine, and crystal formation was prevented by up to or more than 8 h,  depending on the concentration of juice. crystal weight in the natural plum juice groups was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. the ph-adjusted plum juice did not show any effect on od(600) and ph, although the presence of juice changed the crystal habit, indicating that the juice slowed the growth rate of crystals. conclusions: natural plum juice at high and moderate concentrations prevented the formation of p. mirabilis-induced crystals for up to 8 h in artificial urine. although ph-adjusted and low-concentration natural juice did not prevent the occurrence of crystals, both types of juice slowed their growth rate.

TI  == gram-negative bacterial infection in thigh abscess can migrate to distant burn depending on burn depth.
AB  == sepsis remains the major cause of death in patients with major burn injuries. in  the present investigation we evaluated the interaction between burn injuries of varying severity and preexisting distant infection. we used gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis) that were genetically engineered to be bioluminescent, which allowed for noninvasive, sequential optical imaging of the extent and severity of the infection. the bioluminescent bacteria migrated from subcutaneous abscesses in the leg to distant burn wounds on the back depending on the severity of the burn injury, and this migration led  to increased mortality of the mice. treatment with ciprofloxacin, injected either in the leg with the bacterial infection or into the burn eschar, prevented this colonization of the wound and decreased mortality. the present data suggest that  burn wounds can readily become colonized by infections distant from the wound itself.

TI  == spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  == microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. however, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in china. we  conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (ni) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from january 2003 to december 2010. we studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. the number of nis per 100 admissions was 10.9. the commonest isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and candida (11.4%). the result indicated that the numbers of patients with acinetobacter sp. infection increased (p=0.004), but with proteus mirabilis infection decreased (p=0.004). the isolated acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost  all antibiotics tested. notably, more frequent acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the p. aeruginosa and e. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. the increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == type i and type ii mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (ps) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ros), such as singlet oxygen ((1) o(2), produced via type ii mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (ho(.), produced via type i mechanism). this study examined the relative contributions of (1) o(2) and ho(.)  to apdt killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. study design/materials and methods: fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (sosg) were used to determine ho(.) and (1) o(2) produced by illumination of two  ps: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (bb6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (pei-ce6). dimethylthiourea is a ho(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (nan(3)) is a quencher of (1) o(2). both apdt and killing by fenton reaction (chemical generation of ho(.)) were carried out on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). results: conjugate pei-ce6 mainly produced (1) o(2) (quenched by nan(3)), while bb6 produced ho(.) in addition to (1) o(2) when nan(3) potentiated probe activation. nan(3) also potentiated hpf activation by fenton reagent. all bacteria were killed by fenton reagent but gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than gram-negatives. nan(3) potentiated fenton-mediated killing of  all bacteria. the ratio of apdt killing between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for bb6 and 25:1 for conjugate pei-ce6. there was a nan(3)  dose-dependent inhibition of apdt killing using both pei-ce6 and bb6 against gram-negative bacteria while nan(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: azidyl radicals may be formed from nan(3) and ho(.). it may be that gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to ho(.) while  gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) o(2). the differences in nan(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of ps binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of nan(3) into cell walls of bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary infections in taiwan: results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart), 2006-2010.
AB  == we investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance among species of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections  in taiwan during the period 2006-2010 as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart). during the study period, 1032 isolates of gram-negative bacilli that had been collected from patients with hepatobiliary infections were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (n = 874, 84.7%) of isolates and escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (n = 323, 31.3%). there were significantly more e. coli (p = 0.001) and proteus mirabilis (p = 0.031) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for less than 48 h and significantly more serratia marcescens (p = 0.035) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p  = 0.008) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for 48 h or longer. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing pathogens was low. the decline in susceptibility rates with time was remarkable for ceftazidime (p = 0.036), ciprofloxacin (p = 0.029), and levofloxacin (p = 0.018). the most effective antibiotics, i.e., those that were active against more than 90% of enterobacteriaceae, were amikacin, cefepime, imipenem, ertapenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to anti-pseudomonal agents was greater than 80%. in this study, we found an overall increase in resistance to antimicrobial agents among gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in taiwan. surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and updates of treatment guidelines are recommended  to help achieve optimal therapy for patients with hepatobiliary infections.

AB  == the metalloproteases zapa of proteus mirabilis and lasb of pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to be virulence factors their respective opportunistic bacterial pathogens, and are members of the structurally related serralysin and thermolysin families of bacterial metalloproteases respectively. secreted at the site of infection, these proteases play a key role in the infection process, contributing to tissue destruction and processing of components of the host immune system. inhibition of these virulence factors may therefore represent an antimicrobial strategy, attenuating the virulence of the infecting pathogen. previously we have screened a library of n-alpha mercaptoamide dipeptide inhibitors against both zapa and lasb, with the aim of mapping the s1' binding site of the enzymes, revealing both striking similarities and important differences in their binding preferences. here we report the design, synthesis, and screening of several inhibitor analogues, based on two parent inhibitors from the original library. the results have allowed for further characterization of the zapa and lasb active site binding pockets, and have highlighted the possibility for development of broad-spectrum bacterial protease inhibitors, effective against enzymes of the thermolysin and serralysin metalloprotease families.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terminalia arjuna wight & arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
AB  == ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. aim: to assess the antimicrobial potential of terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, escherchia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. materials and methods: methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of t. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. results: of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against s. aureus. organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested gram negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. however, aqueous extract of t. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against s. aureus. all the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. conclusion: organic extract obtained from the t. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially s. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.

TI  == bacteriology of infected burn wounds in the burn wards of a teaching hospital in  southwest nigeria.
AB  == background: burns are characterized by the loss of varying proportions of the protective layers of the skin, depression of immune responses, and increased wound susceptibility to infection. wound infection is a major cause of morbidity  and mortality in burn cases. this study characterizes those factors that predispose burn wounds to infection and the bacteriology of the microorganisms in our environment. patients and methods: prospective study of burns patients that were admitted and treated at the lagos state university teaching hospital (lasuth), ikeja-lagos, nigeria between january 1 and may 31, 2010 was carried out. information about the demographics, aetiology/mechanism of burns, interval between the time of injury and admission, microbial studies, and antibiotic therapy were collected and analyzed. results: a total of 74 patients consisting of 43 males and 31 females were seen. the ages range between one week and 95 +/-  22.42 years. wound infections were confirmed in 28 patients (infection rate of 37.84 per 100 patients). delayed presentation at lasuth and length of hospital stay were significantly related to the development of wound infection. pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were the most common infective organisms occurring in 53.6 and 10.7 percentages respectively. the isolated organisms were resistant to the beta-lactam antibiotics and mostly sensitive to carbapenem and aztreonam preparations. conclusion: factors predisposing to invasive wound infections in our environment were highlighted and suggestions made on methods that could reduce the infections and thus reduce morbidity and mortality in burns.

TI  == broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h nmr  spectroscopy.
AB  == to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (uti), we applied (1)h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. study includes 682 urine samples from suspected uti patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (gnb) (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter, acinetobacter, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (gpc) (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b, staphylococcus saprophyticus). acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine  (tma), citrate, trimethylamin-n-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)h nmr spectroscopy. all urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. multivariate discriminant function analysis (dfa) reveals that acetate, lactate,  succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from uti patients. this statistical analysis was also able to classify gnb to gpc infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). this technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing gnb and gpc infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. the determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of uti patients.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

TI  == post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  == salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. the purpose of this study was to analyse infections in  our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (ap). a retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (sl) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. the antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. infection was defined by tabet and johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cn stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin  levels <3.2 g/l (p = 0.012). there was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low bmis. the most common organisms  isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus mrsa (43%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis (7% each). all these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. pseudomonas and serratia were  not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. the current antibiotic regime following sl is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. it would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of ap for patients undergoing sl that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. in addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. other aspects of surgical management should be also  taken in consideration.

TI  == antiquorum sensing and antibiofilm potential of capparis spinosa.
AB  == background: emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens often leads to the failure of existing antibiotics to treat bacterial infections; thus, there is a need to seek alternative treatment measures. the aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-quorum sensing (anti-qs) and antibiofilm potential of capparis spinosa to prevent the onset of bacterial infections as an alternate to  antibiotics. methods: the methanolic extract of the dried fruits of c. spinosa was assessed for its activity in inhibiting qs-depedent phenomenon such as violacein pigment production in chromobacterium violaceum, biosurfactant production in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, swimming and swarming motility, exopolysaccharide production (eps) and biofilm formation in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and pao1. results: extract of c. spinosa showed a higher degree of anti-qs activity in a dose dependent manner without affecting the bacterial growth. at 2 mg/ml, this extract significantly (p </=0.005) inhibited the biofilm formation to 79, 75, 73, 70% and eps production to 58, 46, 66 and 67% in s. marcescens, pao1, e. coli and p. mirabilis, respectively. it also exhibited inhibition in swimming and swarming motility of bacterial pathogens. the non-enzymatic nature of the anti-qs compound in c. spinosa was confirmed by proteinase k and heat treatment. conclusions: because the methanolic extract of c. spinosa demonstrated anti-qs and antibiofilm activity at 0.5-2 mg/ml, it could be further exploited for novel molecules to treat the emerging infections of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the smart study in spain (2002-2010).
AB  == introduction: the smart (study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). material and methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the smart study performed in spain from 2002 to 2010. isolates were recovered in 16 centres. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). frequency of esbl-producing isolates was: e. coli, 8.7%; k. pneumoniae, 8.4%; klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. overall, esbl-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with eucast criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against esbl producers (95.5-100%). susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among esbl-producing isolates. nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in esbl-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. conclusions: antimicrobial susceptibility data from the smart-spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. this is also supported by the high frequency of esbl-producers in our geographic area.

TI  == plasmid-mediated transfer of the bla(ndm-1) gene in gram-negative rods.
AB  == the latest threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase ndm-1 (new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in enterobacteriacae. five bla(ndm) (-1) -positive plasmids of  different incompatibility groups (incl/m, fii, a/c and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium and proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. conjugation  frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees c compared  with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees c. carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. none of the five plasmids was transferable to acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. this work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(ndm) (-1)  gene could be among enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria.
AB  == purpose: sperm immobilization factor isolated from staphylococcus aureus immobilizes human spermatozoa as well as motile bacteria, showing that sperm immobilization factor receptor might be shared by bacteria and human spermatozoa. thus, we sought to identify a common sperm immobilization factor binding receptor on spermatozoa and bacteria. materials and methods: sperm immobilization factor was isolated from s. aureus. sperm immobilization factor binding receptors were isolated from spermatozoa and bacteria. results: antisperm antibodies in humans cross-reacted with bacteria antibodies. thus, molecular similarities between determinants of spermatozoa and pathogenic microorganisms can be inferred. sperm  immobilization factor isolated from s. aureus immobilized spermatozoa (150 mug/ml) and motile bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis (500 mug/ml). this showed the presence of a common sperm immobilization factor binding conformation on spermatozoa and bacteria. furthermore, receptors binding sperm immobilization factor were extracted and purified from spermatozoa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria was confirmed by observing the blockage  of spermatozoa immobilization by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of receptors isolated from spermatozoa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa or p. mirabilis. also, a higher concentration of sperm immobilization factor (200 mug/ml) caused sperm death. blocking the death of spermatozoa induced by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of these receptors provided further evidence for a common  receptor. conclusions: results provide evidence for molecular similarity between  bacteria and spermatozoa.

TI  == effective cohorting and "superisolation" in a single intensive care unit in response to an outbreak of diverse multi-drug-resistant organisms.
AB  == background: cohorting patients in dedicated hospital wards or wings during infection outbreaks reduces transmission of organisms, yet frequently, this may not be feasible because of inadequate capacity, especially in the intensive care  unit (icu). we hypothesized that cohorting isolation patients in one geographic location in a single icu and using enhanced isolation procedures ("superisolation") can prevent the further spread of highly multi-drug-resistant  organisms (mdro). methods: six patients dispersed throughout our surgical trauma  burn icu had infections with carbapenem-resistant, non-clonal gram-negative mdro, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas hydrophilia, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and providencia rettgeri. five of the six patients also had simultaneous isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). under threat of unit closure and after all standard isolation procedures had been enacted, these six patients were moved to the front six beds of the unit, the front entrance was closed, and all traffic was redirected through the back entrance. nursing staff were assigned to either two isolation or two non-isolation patients. in accordance with the practice of semmelweis, rounds were conducted so as to end at the rooms of the patients with  the most highly-resistant bacterial infections. results: a few months after these interventions, all six patients had been discharged from the icu (three alive and three dead), and no new cases of infection with any of their pathogens (based on  species and antibiogram) or vre occurred. the mean icu stay and overall hospital  length of stay for these six patients were 78.3 days and 117.2 days respectively, with a mortality rate of 50%. conclusion: cohorting patients to one area and altering work routines to minimize contact with patients with mdro (essentially designating a "high-risk" zone) may be beneficial in stopping patient-to-patient  spread of highly resistant bacteria without the need for a dedicated isolation unit.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens in canada from 2007 to 2009:  canward surveillance study.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2009, an annual canadian national surveillance study (canward) tested 2,943 urinary culture pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibilities according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. the most frequently isolated urinary pathogens were as follows (number of isolates, percentage of all isolates): escherichia coli (1,581, 54%),  enterococci (410, 14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (274, 9%), proteus mirabilis (122,  4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (100, 3%), and staphylococcus aureus (80, 3%). the rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (sxt) were 78, 86, 84, and 93%, respectively, for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and s. aureus. the rates of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin were 96, 97, 33, and 100%, respectively, for e. coli, enterococci, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. the rates of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 81, 40, 86, 81, 66, and 41%, respectively, for e. coli, enterococci, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus. statistical analysis of resistance rates (resistant plus intermediate isolates) by year for e. coli over the 3-year study period demonstrated that increased resistance rates occurred only for amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 1.8 to 6.6%; p < 0.001) and for sxt (from 18.6 to 24.3%; p = 0.02). for isolates of e. coli, in a multivariate logistic regression  model, hospital location was independently associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (p = 0.026) with higher rates of resistance observed in inpatient areas (medical, surgical, and intensive care unit wards). increased age was also  associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001) and with resistance to two or more commonly prescribed oral agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and sxt) (p = 0.005). we conclude that frequently  prescribed empirical agents for urinary tract infections, such as sxt and ciprofloxacin, demonstrate lowered in vitro susceptibilities when tested against  recent clinical isolates.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in egypt.
AB  == background: gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) is a rare disease with a high rate of mortality. objectives: the aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of primary and secondary gnbm and to evaluate the efficacy of ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) in the treatment of this disease. materials and methods: a retrospective study was conducted including 95 patients with gnbm admitted to the abbassia and imbaba fever hospitals' meningitis wards in egypt during the period from 1993 to the end of the year 2009. their cerebrospinal fluid samples were subjected to conventional bacteriological methods for isolation of the causative gram-negative bacilli. forty-nine patients had primary gnbm (no predisposing cause of meningitis was detected) and 46 patients had secondary gnbm (with a predisposing cause of meningitis). results: primary gnbm was characterized by an abrupt onset and was significantly associated with typical signs of meningeal irritation. the most common infecting organisms were salmonella typhi in 16 (33%) patients and escherichia coli in 15 (31%) patients. of the patients with primary gnbm, 26 (53%) were cured, 11 (22%) developed neurological sequalae, and 12 (24%) patients died. secondary gnbm was characterized by an insidious onset and significantly associated with unarousable coma. the most common infecting organisms were proteus mirabilis in 17 (37%) patients and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16 (35%) patients. the most common predisposing factor of meningitis was otitis media and  occurred in 26 (57%) patients. of the patients with secondary gnbm, 15 (33%) were cured, 15 (33%) developed neurological sequalae, and 16 (35%) died. primary gnbm  was significantly associated with a higher cure rate than secondary gnbm. the duration of symptoms in patients with secondary gnbm was significantly higher than in those with primary gnbm. ceftriaxone was the initial drug for treatment of these patients until the antibiotic sensitivity tests were reported. the overall resistance rate to the drug was 4%. conclusion and recommendations: gnbm  still has a high mortality rate and should be managed as a medical emergency. gnbm should be suspected in patients with otitis media, neurosurgical, and head trauma or who underwent spinal anesthesia and have disturbance in their level of  consciousness, even if there are no signs of meningeal irritation. ceftriaxone is still an effective drug and had a low rate of resistance in our study.

TI  == synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
AB  == chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn  model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p  = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == relationship between the camp levels in leukocytes and the cytokine balance in patients surviving gram negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes secrete proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12. over-activation of host defense systems may result in severe tissue damage and requires regulation. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-10 are candidate cytokines  for inducing tolerance to lipopolysaccharide re-stimulation. we compared cytokines secreted by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood cells from patients who had survived gram negative bacterial pneumonia (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, n = 26) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 18). interleukin-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression was significantly lower in patients (p = 0.0039 and p<0.001) compared to healthy controls, while granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production was markedly higher in patients (p<0.001). levels of interleukin-10 were comparable. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor expression was inversely correlated with interleukin-12p70 (r = -0.71, p<0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = -0.64, p<0.001) expression; interleukin-10 showed no significant correlation. in  unstimulated leukocytes from patients, camp levels were significantly raised (p = 0.020) and were correlated inversely with interleukin-12p70 levels (r = -0.81, p<0.001) and directly with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (r = 0.72, p = 0.0020), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (r = 0.67, p = 0.0067) and interleukin-10 (r  = 0.54, p = 0.039) levels. our results demonstrate that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes  is a useful indicator of tolerance induction in surviving pneumonia patients and  that measuring camp in freshly isolated leukocytes may also be clinically significant.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  == referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. in this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with gram-negative bloodstream infection (bsi). we identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with gram-negative bsi in a referral cohort of patients treated at mayo clinic hospitals and a population-based cohort of olmsted county, minnesota, residents between 1 january 1998 and 31 december 2007, respectively. multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. elderly patients aged >/=80 years with gram-negative bsi were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (or) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (ci) 0.30-0.62] as were females (or 0.63, 95% ci 0.53-0.74). after adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of escherichia coli (or 0.50, 95% ci 0.43-0.58) and proteus mirabilis (or 0.49, 95% ci 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.26, 95% ci 1.70-3.06), enterobacter cloacae (or 2.31, 95% ci 1.53-3.66), serratia marcescens (or 2.34, 95% ci 1.33-4.52) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (or 17.94, 95% ci 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented  in the referral cohort. we demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with gram-negative bsi had an influence on referral patterns. these factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.

TI  == the nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy.
AB  == this study was conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout japan between january 2008 and june 2008. a total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. the strains investigated in this study are as follows: enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), escherichia coli (n = 255), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), proteus mirabilis (n = 42), serratia marcescens (n = 44), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) manual. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. although a majority of the e. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. the proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and s. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. the proportions of e. coli, p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae, and s. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. the proportions of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%,  and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. these data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.

TI  == photodynamic therapy with a cationic functionalized fullerene rescues mice from fatal wound infections.
AB  == aims: fullerenes are under intensive study for potential biomedical applications. we have previously reported that a c60 fullerene functionalized with three dimethylpyrrolidinium groups (bf6) is a highly active broad-spectrum antimicrobial photosensitizer in vitro when combined with white-light illumination. we asked whether this high degree of in vitro activity would translate into an in vivo therapeutic effect in two potentially lethal mouse models of infected wounds. materials & methods: we used stable bioluminescent bacteria and a low light imaging system to follow the progress of the infection noninvasively in real time. an excisional wound on the mouse back was contaminated with one of two bioluminescent gram-negative species, proteus mirabilis (2.5 x 10(7) cells) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 x 10(6) cells). a solution of bf6 was placed into the wound followed by delivery of up to 180 j/cm(2) of broadband white light (400-700 nm). results: in both cases there was a light-dose-dependent reduction of bioluminescence from the wound not observed in  control groups (light alone or bf6 alone). fullerene-mediated photodynamic therapy of mice infected with p. mirabilis led to 82% survival compared with 8% survival without treatment (p < 0.001). photodynamic therapy of mice infected with highly virulent p. aeruginosa did not lead to survival, but when photodynamic therapy was combined with a suboptimal dose of the antibiotic tobramycin (6 mg/kg for 1 day) there was a synergistic therapeutic effect with a  survival of 60% compared with a survival of 20% with tobramycin alone (p < 0.01). conclusion: these data suggest that cationic fullerenes have clinical potential as an antimicrobial photosensitizer for superficial infections where red light is not needed to penetrate tissue.

TI  == incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: there is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. objective: this study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. methods: a microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between march 2004 and may 2005 was performed. relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. definitions of infections were based on the centers for disease control (cdc) criteria. in the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. results: there were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with haemophilus influenzae and corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns), and enterobacter spp were cultured from  the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with cns (32), s. aureus (28), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), e. coli (5), corynebacterium species (3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) proteus mirabilis (4), enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with cns on 2 occasions. seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured staphylococcus species in their nares. four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. most items were heat sterilized. cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. the choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. the ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. staffs were not protected when handling  linen. infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. they were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. the only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. all waste types were stored together prior to final  disposal away from the public. conclusion: the incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.

TI  == synthesis and spectrum of the neoglycoside achn-490.
AB  == achn-490 is a neoglycoside, or "next-generation" aminoglycoside (ag), that has been identified as a potentially useful agent to combat drug-resistant bacteria emerging in hospitals and health care facilities around the world. a focused medicinal chemistry campaign produced a collection of over 400 sisomicin analogs  from which achn-490 was selected. we tested achn-490 against two panels of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, many of which harbored ag resistance mechanisms. unlike legacy ags, achn-490 was active against strains expressing known ag-modifying enzymes, including the three most common such enzymes found in enterobacteriaceae. achn-490 inhibited the growth of ag-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mic(90), </=4 mug/ml), with the exception of proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (mic(90), 8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively). achn-490 was more active alone in vitro against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates with ag-modifying enzymes than against those with altered permeability/efflux. the mic(90) of achn-490 against ag-resistant staphylococci was 2 mug/ml. due to its promising in vitro and in vivo profiles, achn-490 has been advanced into clinical development as a new antibacterial agent.

AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

AB  == the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary  tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the  three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to  help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  == aim: bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (vlus) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically  infected ulcers is unknown. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of vlus by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. methods: the ulcers of 178 patients were sampled  weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology  standardised to ensure data reproducibility. results: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. the species most frequently found were staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), finegoldia magna (21.4%) and proteus mirabilis (16.1%). no single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. the presence of c striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. conclusion: routine bacteriological culture analysis of the vlu wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. however, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. the presence of c striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing vlu by normal skin flora.

TI  == antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central argentina--isolation of an active principle from achyrocline satureioides.
AB  == the great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central argentina were therefore evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. the susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus was determined. extracts from achyrocline  satureioides, flourensia oolepis, lepechinia floribunda, and lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with mic and mbc values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/ml, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity-guided isolation of a. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-o-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. this compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with mic and mbc values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/ml, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the mic and mbc were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/ml, respectively. the strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from a. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two croatian hospitals: mystic study results.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. we now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective gram-negative pathogen groups from two croatian hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. a total of 1510 gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi.there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. almost  20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in e. coli was 10% and in k. pneumoniae 49%. pcr and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of shv-5 in nine e. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. five k. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(shv-5 )gene. eight esbl positive enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and ctx-m beta-lactamases. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were not found among k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter spp. three a. baumannii strains from zagreb university center were identified by multiplex pcr as oxa-58 like producers. six a. baumannii strains from split university center were found to possess an isaba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(oxa-51 )gene. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. these data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for a. baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing otitis externa in dogs.
AB  == bacterial agents are considered important pathogens causing external otitis in dogs. it is essential to carry out bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test in the case of otitis externa, particularly for chronic or recurring cases. sterile swab samples were obtained from terminal part of vertical ear canals of 74 dogs with otitis externa for cytology, bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. cytologic smears were stained using gram and giemsa staining methods. aerobic bacterial culture performed on blood agar and macconkey agar. among total number of 92 isolated bacteria, 68 were staphylococcus intermedius. other isolated bacteria included: pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pasteurella canis, and six other species of coagulase-negative staphylococcus. antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed for all isolated bacteria using 14 antibiotics. based on the results of this study, all isolated staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to amikacin, enrofloxacin, and rifampin, and had low resistance to gentamicin, cephalothin and ceftriaxone. more than half of gram-positive isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. generally, all isolated gram-negative bacteria, were sensitive to amikacin and enrofloxacin, and had low resistance to  ceftriaxone and gentamicin. they were highly resistant to penicillin, eythromycin, and cephalothin. regarding the results of this study, in cases of uncomplicated otitis externa, it is possible to select antimicrobial drugs merely based on cytology, but it is recommended to perform bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. however, in complicated or refractory cases, antimicrobials should be selected based on bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative nonurinary bacteria to fosfomycin and other antimicrobials.
AB  == background: fosfomycin is an antimicrobial commonly used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. the microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin against nonurinary gram-negative isolates has not been widely investigated. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against gram-negative nonurinary isolates in a region of greece where considerable antimicrobial resistance has been detected. methods: data were retrieved from the microbiological library of the university hospital of heraklion, crete. we retrospectively examined the susceptibility of all gram-negative nonurinary isolates to fosfomycin, collected over 1 year (january-december 2008). results: a total of 594 nonurinary gram-negative isolates were examined. susceptibility testing was performed for 270 (45.4%) enterobacteriaceae, 209 (35.2%) gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli and 115 (19.4%) other gram-negative bacteria. in total, 385 (64.8%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. specifically, all escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella species isolates were susceptible. additionally, 73 out of 94 (77.7%) klebsiella pneumoniae (including  carbapenem-resistant strains), 22 out of 32 (68.8%) enterobacter species and 51 out of 79 (64.5%) pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. susceptibility was highest amongst isolates (45 of 61; 73.8%) taken from outpatients and lowest for intensive care unit isolates (78 of 161; 48.4%). isolates originating from the pediatric wards exhibited higher susceptibility (45 of 63; 71.4%) than isolates originating from other departments (340 of 531; 64%). conclusion: in a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance,  fosfomycin seems to exhibit good levels of in vitro activity against gram-negative nonurinary isolates. these data justify further evaluation of its potential clinical effectiveness.

TI  == development of an oregano-based ointment with anti-microbial activity including activity against methicillin-resistant staphlococcus aureus.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistance has prompted a search for new compounds with anti-microbial activity. in the authors' previous study, oregano extract was identified as one of the most potent anti-microbial compounds. the disk diffusion method was employed to assess the degree of inhibition against various microorganisms, and the bacteriostatic or bactericidal mechanism of action. disk  diffusion studies showed that oregano was found to be bacteriostatic for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, (mrsa) but bacteriocidal for seven other microorganisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa could not be inhibited by oregano. an ointment consisting of 1-10% oregano could inhibit most  organisms except for proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris, which required 20% and pseudomonas which could not be inhibited even at the highest concentration of 80%. oregano extracts can be formulated into an ointment that shows broad antimicrobial activity. additional testing to assess tissue toxicity and other adverse reactions would be needed prior to human testing.

TI  == microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of  these voice prostheses. over a 5-year period, implantation of a provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. in total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. the most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was c. albicans, followed by c. krusei and c. tropicalis. the most frequently isolated bacteria included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus agalactiae. simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. the mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. the longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. there is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the  device life time.

TI  == assessing the emergence of resistance: the absence of biological cost in vivo may compromise fosfomycin treatments for p. aeruginosa infections.
AB  == background: fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor used efficiently to treat uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. a very convenient feature of fosfomycin, among others, is that although the expected frequency of resistant mutants is high, the biological cost associated with mutation impedes an effective growth rate, and bacteria cannot offset the obstacles posed by host  defenses or compete with sensitive bacteria. due to the current scarcity of new antibiotics, fosfomycin has been proposed as an alternative treatment for other infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, whether fosfomycin resistance in p. aeruginosa provides a fitness cost still remains unknown. principal findings: we herein present experimental evidence to show that fosfomycin resistance cannot only emerge easily during treatment, but that it is also cost-free for p. aeruginosa. we also tested if, as has been reported for other species such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, fosfomycin resistant strains are somewhat compromised in their virulence. as concerns colonization, persistence, lung damage, and lethality, we found no differences between the fosfomycin resistant mutant and its sensitive parental strain. the probability of acquisition in vitro of resistance to the combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics (tobramycin and imipenem) has also been studied. while the combination of fosfomycin with tobramycin makes improbable the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics when administered together, the combination of fosfomycin plus imipenem does not avoid the appearance of mutants resistant to both antibiotics. conclusions: we have reached the conclusion that the use of fosfomycin for p. aeruginosa infections, even in combined therapy, might not be as promising as expected. this study should encourage the scientific community to assess the in vivo cost of resistance for specific antibiotic-bacterial species combinations, and therefore avoid reaching universal conclusions from single model organisms.

TI  == [characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  == introduction: to analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. to assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. materials and methods: an epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients,  in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. of these, 106 came from  patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. the sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using roc curves. results: positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (mmc) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). the microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was escherichia coli, followed by enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. in the icu subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was enterococcus faecalis, followed by escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. specificity was low in both groups. conclusions: e. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the icu group. the groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with mmc and spinal cord injuries. sensitivity and specificity (as measured using roc curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).

TI  == triblock copolymer matrix-based capillary electrophoretic microdevice for high-resolution multiplex pathogen detection.
AB  == rapid and simple analysis for the multiple target pathogens is critical for patient management. ce-sscp analysis on a microchip provides high speed, high sensitivity, and a portable genetic analysis platform in molecular diagnostic fields. the capability of separating ssdna molecules in a capillary electrophoretic microchannel with high resolution is a critical issue to perform  the precise interpretation in the electropherogram. in this study, we explored the potential of poly(ethyleneoxide)-poly(propyleneoxide)-poly(ethyleneoxide) (peo-ppo-peo) triblock copolymer as a sieving matrix for ce-sscp analysis on a microdevice. to demonstrate the superior resolving power of peo-ppo-peo copolymers, 255-bp pcr amplicons obtained from 16s ribosomal rna genes of four bacterial species, namely proteus mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria meningitidis, were analyzed in the peo-ppo-peo matrix in comparison with 5% linear polyacrylamide and commercial genescan gel. due to enhanced dynamic coating and sieving ability, peo-ppo-peo copolymer displayed fourfold enhancement of resolving power in the ce-sscp to separate same-sized dna molecules. fivefold input of genomic dna of p. aeruginosa and/or n. meningitidis  produced proportionally increased corresponding amplicon peaks, enabling correct  quantitative analysis in the pathogen detection. besides the high-resolution sieving capability, a facile loading and replenishment of gel in the microchannel due to thermally reversible gelation property makes peo-ppo-peo triblock copolymer an excellent matrix in the ce-sscp analysis on the microdevice.

TI  == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB  == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to  that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of  potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

AB  == background: resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. the presence of esbl producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. materials and methods: in the period from june 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection.  the isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl by double disc synergy test (ddst- a screening test)and then phenotypic  confirmatory test. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method. results: from the sample of 238 gram-negative  bacilli, we isolated escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii and enterobacter cloacae. following both methods, 34% isolates were esbl-positive. the esbl producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-esbl producers. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in esbl positive isolates than non-esbl isolates (21.66%). conclusion: high prevalence of esbl in our hospital cannot be ignored. esbl producers can be detected by ddst and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. the sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of  one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. we recommend ddst using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.

TI  == bacterial colonization of chronic leg ulcers: current results compared with data  5 years ago in a specialized dermatology department.
AB  == background: in nearly every chronic wound different bacteria species can be detected. nevertheless, the presence of such microorganisms is not necessarily obligatory associated with a delayed wound healing. but from this initially unproblematic colonization an infection up to a sepsis can arise in some patients. the aim of our clinical investigation was to analyse the spectrum of microbial colonization of patients with a chronic leg ulcer in our specialized dermatological outpatient wound clinic, and to compare them with the results of comparable data already collected 5 years ago. objectives: in our retrospective investigation the results of bacteriological swabs were documented in 100 patients with a total of 107 chronic leg ulcers. all patients visited the specialized wound outpatient clinic, department of dermatology, university of essen in germany. methods: a total of 60 patients were female, 40 were male. the  mean age was 65 years. altogether a total of 191 bacterial isolates and 25 different bacterial species could be identified. results: the most often detected species were staphylococcus aureus (n = 60), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 36) as well as proteus mirabilis (n = 17). in 10 patients (10%) we identified a colonization with methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa). merely in 6 patients the taken swabs were sterile. five years ago a comparable investigation was already carried out in our wound outpatient clinic. at that time we could detect  in particular more frequent mrsa (21.5% vs. 10%) and rarely p. aeruginosa (24.1%  vs. 33.6%). conclusion: the results of our investigation demonstrate the current  spectrum of the bacterial colonization in patients with chronic leg ulcers in a university dermatological wound centre in comparison to the last 5 years. in our  institution we were able to demonstrate a shift of the detected bacterial species from gram-positive in direction to gram-negative germs. beside the already known  problems with mrsa, in future therapeutic strategies in patients with chronic leg ulcers the increasing amount of gram-negative bacteria and especially of p. aeruginosa should considered.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == feijoa sellowiana berg. fruit, widely used for human consumption, is well appreciated for its good nutritional characteristics and for its pleasant flavor  and aroma. in a prior study we showed that the acetonic extract of f. sellowiana  fruit exerts a potent antibacterial activity against some gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. to confirm and deepen the study on antimicrobial activities of the fruit, in this article we analyze the same extract for its effectiveness against different kind of bacteria both as american type culture collection standard strains and clinically isolates, the gram-negative helicobacter pylori, and three fungal strains (one human pathogen and two phytopathogens). our aim was also to isolate and define the active component(s) involved in the antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-h. pylori activity of the extract through activity-guided fractionation procedures. this allowed us to identify flavone as the active compound of f. sellowiana fruit. flavone showed a  high antibacterial activity against the nine standard bacterial strains tested and the matched clinically isolated bacterial strains and was significantly more  active against h. pylori than metronidazole. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris from both standard and clinical sources showed a  very high sensitivity to flavone (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] = 1.95 microg/ml for standard strains and 3.9 microg/ml for clinical isolates of the three bacteria), showing also good minimal bactericidal concentration values. among fungi tested, rhyzoctonia solani was the most sensitive strain to the action of flavone (mic = 62.5 microg/ml).

TI  == use of quorum sensing antagonists to deter the formation of crystalline proteus mirabilis biofilms.
AB  == proteus mirabilis biofilms are a major cause of urinary catheter blockage. antibiotic-impregnated catheters used to prevent catheter blockage have achieved  limited success. research has examined the efficacy of quorum sensing inhibitors  against pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, but there are few reports of the effects of these compounds against crystalline p. mirabilis biofilms. this study examined the effect of two quorum sensing antagonists, p-nitrophenyl glycerol (pnpg) and tannic acid, against crystalline p. mirabilis biofilms. tannic acid and pnpg were observed to inhibit the quorum sensing system and the formation of p. mirabilis biofilms grown in artificial urine. the success of these compounds provides a possible means of preventing urinary catheter encrustation.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == pseudomonas aeruginosa las quorum sensing autoinducer suppresses growth and biofilm production in legionella species.
AB  == bacteria commonly communicate with each other by a cell-to-cell signalling mechanism known as quorum sensing (qs). recent studies have shown that the las qs autoinducer n-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c(12)-hsl) of pseudomonas aeruginosa performs a variety of functions not only in intraspecies communication, but also in interspecies and interkingdom interactions. in this study, we report the effects of pseudomonas 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl on the growth and suppression of virulence factors in other bacterial species that frequently co-exist with ps. aeruginosa in nature. it was found that 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl, but not its analogues, suppressed the growth of legionella pneumophila in a dose-dependent manner. however, 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl did not exhibit a growth-suppressive effect on serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia  coli, alcaligenes faecalis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. a concentration of 50 microm 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl completely inhibited the growth of l. pneumophila. additionally, a significant suppression of biofilm formation was demonstrated in  l. pneumophila exposed to 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl. our results suggest that the pseudomonas qs autoinducer 3-oxo-c(12)-hsl exerts both bacteriostatic and virulence factor-suppressive activities on l. pneumophila alone.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == large scale multiplex pcr improves pathogen detection by dna microarrays.
AB  == background: medium density dna microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. however, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in  clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen dna. results: to  increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex pcr (lsplex pcr) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. this protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. the lsplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. application of lsplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. conclusion:  our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen dna by microarray hybridization by using lsplex pcr.

TI  == comparison of solid-phase cytometry and the plate count method for the evaluation of the survival of bacteria in pharmaceutical oils.
AB  == aim: to compare the survival of four bacterial strains (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa) in pharmaceutical oils, including jojoba oil/tea tree oil, carbol oil, jojoba oil and sesame oil. methods and results: oils were spiked with the test bacteria in a concentration of 10(4)  cfu ml(-1). bacteria were extracted from oils with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% tween 20. aliquots of the pooled water layers were analysed by solid-phase cytometry and plate counting. plate counts dropped to zero for all test strains exposed for 24 h to three of the four oils. in contrast, significant numbers of viable cells were still detected by spc, except in the jojoba oil/tea  tree oil mixture and partly in sesame oil. conclusions: exposure of bacteria for  24 h to the two oils containing an antimicrobial led to a loss of their culturability but not necessarily of their viability. the antibacterial activity  of the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture supersedes that of carbol oil. significance and impact of the study: these in vitro data suggest that the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture more than carbol oil inhibits bacterial proliferation when used for intermittent self-catherization.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of pomegranate rind extracts: enhancement by addition of metal salts and vitamin c.
AB  == background: punica granatum l. or pomegranates, have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against a range of gram positive and negative bacteria. pomegranate formulations containing ferrous salts have enhanced although short-term, antibacteriophage activities which are rapidly diminished owing to instability of the ferrous combination. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activities of combinations of pomegranate rind extracts (pre) with a range of metals salts with the added stabiliser vitamin c. methods: pre solutions, prepared by blending rind sections with distilled water prior to sterilisation by autoclaving or filtration, were screened with a disc diffusion assay using penicillin g as a control. suspension assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of pre alone and in combination with salts of the following metals; fe (ii), cu (ii), mn (ii) or zn (ii), and vitamin c, against a  panel of microbes following exposure for 30 mins. the test organisms included staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. results: the screening assay demonstrated that  pre exhibited activity against the gram positive organisms at 24 h with no observable effect on any of the gram negative bacteria. however, after 12 h, zones of inhibition were only observed for ps. aeruginosa. in contrast, using the suspension assay, addition of cu (ii) salts to pre solutions extended the activities resulting in no detectable growth being observed for the pre/cu (ii) combination against e. coli, ps. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. minimal antimicrobial activity was observed following incubation with fe (ii), mn (ii) or zn (ii) salts alone or in combination with pre against any of the organisms in the test panel. the addition of vitamin c markedly enhanced the activities of both pre/fe (ii) and pre/cu (ii) combinations against s. aureus. conclusion: this is the first report demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of pre/metal salt combinations in the presence of the stabilising agent vitamin c, to which all isolates were sensitive with the exception of b. subtilis. this study has validated the exploration of pre along with additives such as metal salts and vitamin c as novel antimicrobial combinations.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == [fluoroquinolones and gram-negative bacteria: antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of resistance].
AB  == fluoroquinolones acts by interacting with type ii topoisomerases (dna gyrase and  topoisomerases iv). related to this mechanism of action, bacteria have developed  resistance mechanisms consisting in some target mutations (gyra/gyrb for dna gyrase and parc/pare for topoisomerase iv) or in a reduced access to the target itself, by either decreased permeability or augmented expression of efflux pumps, such as acrab and mexab. along with these classical mechanisms of chromosomal resistance, the presence of fluoroquinolones resistant proteins (qnr) has been recently evidenced, codified by transmissible genes by means of plasmids, especially in enterobacter spp., escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas proteus mirabilis and non fermenter gram-negative, like acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, are not involved in such a kind of resistance. qnr proteins determine a slight increase in mic values, which often remains below the susceptibility breakpoint. more relevant is their impact on mpc values. additionally, new specific resistance mechanisms have been described. aac(6')-ib-cr represents the first enzyme able to inactivate, by acetylation, antimicrobials of two different classes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. however, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but not levofloxacin, are susceptible to  this enzyme action. finally, the presence of another resistance mechanism has been reported, an efflux-pump plasmid-mediated, codified by the qepa gene, which  acts by a selective mechanism. only hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not all the other ones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc, are affected by this mechanism. in the light of these new information, it is clear that, in terms of bacterial resistance, it is not any more possible to assimilate one fluoroquinolones to another, since different molecules can be diversely active, due to the specific resistance mechanism.

TI  == chitosan acetate bandage as a topical antimicrobial dressing for infected burns.
AB  == an engineered chitosan acetate bandage preparation (hemcon) is used as a hemostatic dressing, and its chemical structure suggests that it should also be antimicrobial. we previously showed that when a chitosan acetate bandage was applied to full-thickness excisional wounds in mice that had been infected with pathogenic bioluminescent bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus), it was able to rapidly kill the bacteria and save the mice from developing fatal infections. wound healing was also stimulated. in the  present study, we asked whether a chitosan acetate bandage could act as a topical antimicrobial dressing when it was applied to third-degree burns in mice contaminated with two of these bacterial species (p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis). preliminary experiments established the length of burn time and the number of bacteria needed to produce fatal infections in untreated mice and established that the chitosan acetate bandage could adhere to the infected burn for up to 21 days. in the case of p. aeruginosa infections, the survival rate of  mice treated with the chitosan acetate bandage was 73.3% (whereas the survival rate of mice treated with a nanocrystalline silver dressing was 27.3% [p = 0.0055] and that of untreated mice was 13.3% [p < 0.0002]). for p. mirabilis infections, the comparable survival rates were 66.7%, 62.5%, and 23.1% respectively. quantitative bioluminescent signals showed that the chitosan acetate bandage effectively controlled the growth of bacteria in the burn and prevented the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that chitosan acetate bandage is efficacious in preventing fatal burn infections.

TI  == uropathogens and host characteristics.
AB  == uropathogens other than escherichia coli occur with greater frequency in patients with risk factors for urinary tract infection (uti). however, little is known about associations between uropathogen species and host characteristics. three hundred nineteen urine specimens containing a balanced distribution of uropathogen species were selected from inpatients and outpatients at a university hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. information on host characteristics was retrospectively collected by chart review. differences in the frequencies of  host characteristics in uti groups, as defined by the causative uropathogen, were compared by chi-square/fisher analysis. multivariate classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify host characteristic subsets that distinguish among uropathogen groups. in this exploratory study, several uropathogen species were found to be strongly linked to host characteristics relevant to uti. patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa utis were more likely to have undergone urinary tract procedures (43% versus 15% overall), to have a neurogenic bladder (29% versus 12% overall), to have received recent antibiotic therapy (52% versus 24% overall), and to be male (76% versus 28% overall). patients with proteus mirabilis utis were more likely to have a foreign body in the lower urinary tract (48% versus 30% overall). the classification tree identified males over the age of 27 years who had undergone a prior urinary tract procedure as belonging to a host characteristic profile associated with p. aeruginosa uti: 38% of patients with p. aeruginosa utis fit this profile. these data may be useful for planning future targeted prophylaxis studies.

AB  == the crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. the aim of this study was to examine  whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization.  models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms  isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. the catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in  0.1 m sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. the effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the ph of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. the extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. in  models inoculated with communities containing proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary ph that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. the biocide had no effect on populations of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. in models inoculated with a mixed community containing providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. although k. pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of  providencia rettgeri. the results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be  limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with proteus mirabilis.

AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == pharmacodynamic performance of tigecycline versus common intravenous antibiotics  for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == background: in clinical trials tigecycline was similar to vancomycin/aztreonam for complicated skin and skin structure infections, but data comparing it with other widely used antibiotics are lacking. we predicted the pharmacodynamic cumulative fraction of response (cfr) of tigecycline against bacteria implicated  in complicated skin and skin structure infections and compared it with the cfrs for piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and imipenem/cilastatin.  methods: a 5,000-patient monte carlo simulation using a two-compartment intravenous infusion model was used to simulate steady-state concentrations for common dosages of these antibiotics. population pharmacokinetics data from infected patients were employed. the cfr was calculated against staphylococcus aureus (42% methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]), streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, and pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from worldwide surveillance (test and sentry) and weighted by prevalence of involvement in complicated skin and skin structure infections. results: excluding mrsa, the weighted cfr was greatest for imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam regimens (93.9%-95.9%). with 42% mrsa added to the model, only tigecycline monotherapy achieved a high cfr (88.2%). the addition of vancomycin raised the cfr to 91.0%, 89.5%, 88.3%, 82.9%, and 78% for imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q6h, imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q8h, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone regimens, respectively. conclusion: tigecycline monotherapy had a likelihood of achieving its requisite pharmacodynamic exposure similar to that of combinations of piperacillin/tazobactam or imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  == a horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (rcws) in taiwan. some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mdr-pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab), were identified. pulsotypes of esbl-producing p. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the prevalences of mrsa, esbl-producing e. coli (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) p. aeruginosa, mdr-pa, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii and mdr-ab were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0%  and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. among the 44 respiratory isolates of  p. mirabilis with an esbl phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were mycobacterium tuberculosis. among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). high prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in rcws.

TI  == [etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary pathogens].
AB  == with the objective of knowing the common etiological agents in urinary infection  and comparing its antimicrobial susceptibility in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we analyse all the urine bacteriological exams from the servico de patologia clinica do centro hospitalar do nordeste, epe - unidade hospitalar de braganca, during a two years period (april 2004 to march  2006). during this period, 4018 urine bacteriological exams were made. the cultural exam was positive in 572 samples (144 from nosocomial infections and 428 from community-acquired urinary infections). the escherichia coli was the more isolated strain (68,4 %), followed by klebsiella spp (7,9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6,1%) and proteus mirabilis (5,2%). concerning to antimicrobial susceptibility, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp showed a high resistance to the antimicrobials amoxicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, ceftazidim and quinolones. for enterobacteriaceae imipenem, amikacin and netilmicin were the antimicrobials with more level of susceptibility. imipenem and amikacin were the  more efficient antimicrobials against pseudomonas aeruginosa. concerning to the susceptibility for the same etiological agent, in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we founded statistical significant differences in the antimicrobials ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and collistin for pseudomonas aeruginosa and in the group of antimicrobials from quinolones for the proteus mirabilis. in the other identified agents there were no statistical significant differences for antimicrobials. this study it allows making use of data necessary for the knowledge of etiologic urinary infection agents in braganca and provides the information about the antimicrobials resistance, which  were necessary to initiate an adequate empirical treatment and to elaborate treatment guides.

TI  == identification of an inhibitor of the murc enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  == the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of  the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first  of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further  characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli,  murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.

TI  == viper metalloproteinase (agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

TI  == performance of chromid esbl, a chromogenic medium for detection of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == the chromogenic agar medium chromid esbl (biomerieux) was compared with blse agar medium (aes) for selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. a total of 765 samples (468 rectal swabs, 255 urine samples and 42 pulmonary aspirations) obtained from 547 patients was processed. all bacterial strains isolated on either medium were further characterized using biochemical tests, and esbl producers were confirmed by synergy testing. genetic characterization of esbl genes was determined by pcr. a total of 33 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae strains [escherichia coli (n=16), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=8), enterobacter spp. (n=3), citrobacter spp. (n=5) and proteus mirabilis (n=1)] was recovered. the sensitivity after 24 h incubation was 88 % for chromid esbl and 85 % for blse agar. at 48 h, the sensitivity of chromid esbl increased to 94 % and was higher than that obtained with blse agar. the positive  predictive value at 24 h for chromid esbl was 38.7 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % ci) 28.3 -50.2 %)], which was significantly higher than that for blse agar  [15.4 %, 95 % ci 10.1 -21.5 %]. on both media, false-positive results were mostly due to pseudomonas aeruginosa and to enterobacteriaceae overproducing chromosomal cephalosporinase (enterobacter spp.) or a chromosomal penicillinase (klebsiella oxytoca). this study showed that chromid esbl, a ready-to-use chromogenic selective medium, is sensitive and specific for rapid, presumptive identification of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. its chromogenic properties and its selectivity are particularly useful in specimens containing resident associated flora.

TI  == characterization of antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  == five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. twenty-two antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at terra nova bay (ross sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. escherichia coli  and proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. none of the isolates inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus candida albicans. active antarctic isolates, identified by 16s  rdna sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-proteobacteria (6 strains). inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of antarctic marine  bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.

TI  == drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic post-operative wounds in a regional referral hospital in uganda.
AB  == background: wound infections have been a problem in the field of surgery for a long time. advances in control of infections have not completely eradicated this  problem because of development of drug resistance. antimicrobial resistance can increase complications and costs associated with procedures and treatment. objective: a study was carried out on drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic postoperative wounds in jinja hospital, uganda. this study was designed to determine the distribution of bacterial pathogens isolated from septic post-operative wounds and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. method: specimens of pus swabs were collected aseptically and analysed in the laboratory. colony characteristics and grams technique were used to differentiate the organisms. biochemical tests were done to confirm the species of the organisms. sensitivity testing was done on the isolates using the disk diffusion  method. results: pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 58.5% of the specimens.  the isolates were: s.aureus (45.1%), coliforms (16.9%), proteus mirabilis (11.3%), p.aeruginosa (9.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%) and enterobacter spp (2.82%). most of the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. there was resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. staphylococcus aureus was generally sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%), ciprofloxacin (68.7%) and methicillin (75%), but resistant to erythromycin (56.2%) and ampicillin (97%). most of the gram-negative bacteria isolated (coliforms, p.aeruginosa, e.coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae) were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftazidime but resistant to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains formed 25% of this species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%) and ceftazidime (85.7%) but showed resistance to  ciprofloxacin (57.2%). some organisms e.g. s.aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis exhibited multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics tested. conclusion: since a high proportion of samples had positive cultures, infection control is recommended as a strategy to minimise spread of resistant organisms. it is recommended that gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime be used in preference to ampicillin and amoxycillin for treatment of septic wounds. there is need to develop national surveillance of antibiotic- resistant organisms.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == use of in vitro susceptibility and pathogen prevalence data to model the expected clinical success rates of tigecycline and other commonly used antimicrobials for  empirical treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == the overall expected coverage for tigecycline and selected antimicrobial regimens based upon prevailing susceptibility rates was evaluated for the empirical therapy of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis). consecutive,  non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from 2000-2005 from patients with documented csssi in 57 medical centres located in the usa (38 centres), france (6 centres), germany (7 centres), italy (3 centres) and spain (3 centres) were used  to evaluate the frequency of pathogen occurrence and susceptibility rates of select parenteral antimicrobials (sentry program). by applying pathogen-specific  susceptibility rates to the frequency of pathogen occurrence in each country, the overall expected coverage for each treatment regimen was measured. the most frequently isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (33.3-49.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3-17.2%), escherichia coli (6.6-13.9%) and enterococci  (4.1-8.8%). tigecycline was highly active against the most common pathogens, except for p. aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the highest overall expected empirical coverage was obtained with combination therapy regimens, including vancomycin plus either imipenem (94.4-99.3%) or piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5-98.2%). among the monotherapy regimens evaluated, tigecycline provided the  highest overall expected coverage in the usa (90.6%), france (89.9%) and italy (83.3%), whilst piperacillin/tazobactam showed the highest expected coverage in germany (93.1%) and imipenem in spain (87.7%). our results suggest that tigecycline represents a viable additional option for the empirical treatment of  csssi in these countries.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (actichelated propolis).
AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == effect of natural preservatives on the growth of histamine producing bacteria.
AB  == present study deals with the hampering of the growth of histamine producing bacteria (hpb), by using nacl and spices which are easily available and cheaper cost wise. for this experiment, four strains of hpb viz. vibrio parahaemolyticus, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were tested against 1 to 10% concentrations of nacl and 1 to 5% concentrations of natural preservatives (turmeric, ginger and garlic) in a basal medium. hpb showed different growth rates at different concentrations of nacl and natural preservatives. v. parahaemolyticus, b. cereus and ps. aeruginosa showed no growth at 10% concentration. when the hpb growth was tested with garlic, turmeric and ginger extracts, growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by garlic and turmeric  extracts at 5% concentration. in ginger, v. parahaemolyticus, b. cereus and p. mirabilis were totally inhibited at 5% concentration. but ps. aeruginosa showed very less growth at this concentration.

TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  == [ecthyma gangrenosum in a patient with non-hodgkin lymphoma].
AB  == introduction: ecthymagangrenosum is a rare disease of the skin that causes the localized necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous fat tissue, leading to the multiple ulcerations surrounded by local hyperaemia. the ulcerations are usually  localized in groins, and perianal area. in the majority of cases ecthyma is caused by a pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. the disease usually appears in immunocompromized, most frequently hematological patients. case report: we presented a 78-year-old woman who had been treated for non-hodgkin lymphoma for the last 18 years. she had recently been given cytotoxics which led to neutropenia. the patient suddenly developed high fever, chill and diarrhea, followed by ecthyma gangrenosum cutaneous lesions in groins, axillas, right side  of the neck and umbilicus. pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis, that were sensitive to several antibiotics were isolated. the treatment included rehydratation, antibiotics, surgical debridement and regular dressing with antiseptics. the healing of all lesions was achieved after sixteen weeks of the treatment. conclusion: if haemorrhagic-necrotic lesions of the skin are developed in immunocompromised, usually haematologic patients, an ecthyma gangrenosum has to be considered immediately, material for identification of a cause has to be taken, followed by immediate administration of antibiotics effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa. surgical debridement and other therapeutic modalities are to be considered in some patients.

AB  == uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from april 1997 to march 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. the various isolates  were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumanii and enterococcus faecalis. antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial uti exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in cameroon. objective: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated in yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in  yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology between march 1995 and april  1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. results: high rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for escherichia coli, = 71% for klebsiella spp., = 98% for proteus mirabilis, = 50% for enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. conclusion: these results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.

AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

TI  == canine cathelicidin (k9cath): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection.  although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel  canine cathelicidin (k9cath). the full-length cdna sequence of k9cath encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature k9cath  peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. synthetic k9cath displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus; mics (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microm, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis; mics 1.25 microm, salmonella serotype  enteritidis; mic 0.5 microm, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mic 0.06 microm), and yeast (candida albicans; mic 12.5-50 microm). k9cath demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum (mic 0.06 and 50 microm, respectively). similar to its ovine congener smap-29, k9cath possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and lps binding capacity. k9cath displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. the potency and broad antimicrobial  activity of k9cath suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.

TI  == microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two brazilian hospitals.
AB  == background: [corrected] endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable aim: the routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period methods: aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures results: a contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. these samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia  coli, enterobacter spp, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus coagulase negative, micrococcus luteus, candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata, c. guilliermondii, bacillus spp and corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified conclusion: inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major  factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. by analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. after this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.

TI  == potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
AB  == the spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial ssti in >70 medical centers participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in north america (37.4%), europe (26.7%), latin america (16.7%), and the asia-pacific region (19.2%). all isolates were tested using the  reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for ssti. ranking pathogens producing ssti during these years included staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), escherichia coli (9.0%), enterococcus spp. (7.3%), klebsiella spp. (4.8%), enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against s. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (mic(50), 0.06 mg/l) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (mic(50), 0.25 mg/l). furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against e. coli, klebsiella spp., and acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against p. aeruginosa. in summary,  garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key gram-positive pathogens (s. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents  against other species (enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.). these in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in ssti, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.

TI  == phytochemisty and spermatogenic potentials of aqueous extract of cissus populnea  (guill. and per) stem bark.
AB  == in vivo clinical trials involving the administration of crude extracts of cissus  populnea to male subjects (normospermic, oligospermic, and azoopermic) in a 72-day study revealed that continuous exposure of the subjects to the extracts over this period did not significantly (p < or = 0.05) alter sperm count, morphology, motility, or volume. antimicrobial screening of the extract against some selected microbial isolates secondarily implicated in male infertility revealed total inactivity against the microbial isolates screened, i.e., staphylococcus aureus, salmonella paratyphi, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and klebsiella sp. phytochemistry revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and steroids. the presence of these secondary metabolites was confirmed by thin layer chromatography. we conclude that oral administration of aqueous extracts of the stem bark of cisssus populnea over a 72-day period to human subjects apparently had no fertility enhancement effects on sperm parameters monitored in this study.

TI  == epidemiology and bacterial colonization of burn injuries in blantyre.
AB  == forty-nine patients from the burns unit at the qech had swabs taken from various  sites in order to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibilities in burn wounds colonized by bacteria. the mean age was 16 years (range 1-70 years); 27 (55 %) of the study population were female and 22 (45%) were male. twenty-four (49%) patients were epileptic. open fire (41%) was the most common cause of burn injuries among epileptics while hot water burns (29%) were commonest among non-epileptics. burn injury and percentage total burn surface area (% tbsa) injuries decreased with age, and the upper and lower limbs, trunk,  head and neck were the most commonly affected sites. staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate (23%), followed by proteus mirabilis (22.7%), streptococci  spp (15.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and 3.4% for escherichia coli, salmonella and klebsiella spp. there was a significant trend of bacterial growth  with increasing % tbsa (p<0.001). bacterial growth was significantly more common  in more recent burns of less than 20 days compared to burns of longer duration (or 4.1 [95% ci 1.58-10.99]). broad-spectrum antibiotics are required as first-line therapy for burns-related sepsis but there is need for surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility to help determine appropriate therapy.

TI  == effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and edta combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (ot), protamine sulfate (ps) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. methods and results: the in vitro activity of ot, ps and edta alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. all the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. however, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory  effect on biofilm formation by k. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis.  furthermore, 79-95% reduction in ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. conclusion: the subinhibitory concentrations of ot, ps and edta in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (gras) compounds such as ot, ps and edta may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase a2 enzymes.
AB  == aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis  venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order  of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.

TI  == evaluating antibiotics for use in medicine using a poloxamer biofilm model.
AB  == background: wound infections, due to biofilms, are a constant problem because of  their recalcitrant nature towards antibiotics. appropriate antibiotic selection for the treatment of these biofilm infections is important. the traditional in vitro disc diffusion method for antibiotic selection uses bacterial cultures grown on agar plates. however, the form of bacterial growth on agar is not representative of how bacteria grow in wounds and other tissue sites as here bacteria grow naturally in a biofilm. the aim of this research was to test a more appropriate method for testing antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms and compare with the standard methods used for antibiotic sensitivity testing. methods: outer membrane protein analysis was performed on e.coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and acinetobacter juni when grown on mueller hinton agar ('quasi-biofilm state') and 30% poloxamer hydrogel ('true- biofilm state). susceptibility to antibiotics on 28 clinical isolates was determined using the modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method, on agar and 30%  poloxamer. results: similar outer membrane proteins [omps] were identified in bacteria grown in a biofilm state and on a 30% poloxamer hydrogel, which were very different to the omps identified in bacteria grown on mueller-hinton agar and broth. there was a significant difference between the means of the clearance  zones around the antibiotic discs on standard agar and poloxamer gels [p < 0.05]. the zones of clearance were generally smaller for poloxamer-grown bacteria than those grown on standard agar. diffusion distances of various antibiotics through  agar and 30% poloxamer showed no significant difference [p > 0.05]. conclusion: the findings of this experiment suggest that poloxamer gel could be used as an appropriate medium on which to conduct biofilm antibiotic susceptibility tests as it enables bacteria to be grown in a state representative of the infected surface from which the culture was taken.

TI  == [bacteriological evaluation in chronic otitis media].
AB  == introduction: in chronic otitis media bacterial infection is often a cause of exacerbation in the clinical course and failure in treatment. the aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and profile of the aerobic bacterial flora in chronic otitis media and to determine the drug susceptibility of selected isolated bacteria. material and methods: the samples of 274 consecutive middle ear discharges taken from 228 patients with chronic otitis media were analysed (which constitutes 41.3% all bacteriological examinations made during 3 years). the smears were obtained using sterile cotton swabs, then incubated and identified. drug susceptibility was determined by disc-diffusion method. results: monocultures were observed in 77% and mixed infections in 17.5% of smears, no growth was found in 5.5%. the 308 pathogen isolates were recovered, among them--273 bacterial (88.6%) and 35--fungal (11.4%). twenty five species of bacterial microorganisms were found, among them the most common isolates were staphylococcus aureus--42.9% and pseudomonas aeruginosa---19.8%. rarely were recovered acinetobacter spp.--4.1%, proteus mirabilis--37%, proteus vulgaris--3.3% and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus--1.5% of bacterial isolates. among fungal pathogens (n=35) aspergillus spp. was isolated in 37.1%, and candida albicans--22.9% of cases. conclusions: (1) aerobic pathogens ---aphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were most frequently found microorganisms in chronic otitis media. (2) mixed infections comprised only a 17.5% of all cultured cases of chronic otitis media. (3) pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible in vitro to imipenem (100%), piperacillin-tazobactam (100%), ceftazidime (98%) and amikacin (89.7%), less susceptible to ciprofloxacin (77.6%) and much less susceptible to pefloxacin (33.6%) and cefotaxim (33.3%).

TI  == comparison of three techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis.
AB  == objectives: to identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. methods: twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. three types of samples were taken from each dog. urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. the samples were then cultured on blood agar and macconkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. results: bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). the most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive staphylococcus species (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and proteus mirabilis (n=1). in the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. however, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. the uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. all the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. clinical significance: when the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis  is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.

TI  == increased resistance to first-line agents among bacterial pathogens isolated from urinary tract infections in latin america: time for local guidelines?
AB  == emerging resistance phenotypes and antimicrobial resistance rates among pathogens recovered from community-acquired urinary tract infections (ca-uti) is an increasing problem in specific regions, limiting therapeutic options. as part of  the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, a total of 611 isolates were collected in 2003 from patients with ca-uti presenting at latin american medical  centers. each strain was tested in a central laboratory using clinical laboratory standard institute (clsi) broth microdilution methods with appropriate controls.  escherichia coli was the leading pathogen (66%), followed by klebsiella spp. (7%), proteus mirabilis (6.4%), enterococcus spp. (5.6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6%). surprisingly high resistance rates were recorded for e. coli against first-line orally administered agents for ca-uti, such as ampicillin (53.6%), tmp/smx (40.4%), ciprofloxacin (21.6%), and gatifloxacin (17.1%). decreased susceptibility rates to tmp/smx and ciprofloxacin were also documented  for klebsiella spp. (79.1 and 81.4%, respectively), and p. mirabilis (71.8 and 84.6%, respectively). for enterococcus spp., susceptibility rates to ampicillin,  chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin were 88.2, 85.3, 55.9, and 97.1%,  respectively. high-level resistance to gentamicin was detected in 24% of enterococcus spp. bacteria isolated from patients with ca-uti in latin america showed limited susceptibility to orally administered antimicrobials, especially for tmp/smx and fluoroquinolones. our results highlight the need for developing specific ca-uti guidelines in geographic regions where elevated resistance to new and old compounds may influence prescribing decisions.

TI  == in-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic therapy combined with conventional endodontic treatment to eliminate root canal biofilm infection.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (pdt), standard endodontic treatment and the combined treatment to eliminate bacterial biofilms present in infected root canals. study  design/materials and methods: ten single-rooted freshly extracted human teeth were inoculated with stable bioluminescent gram-negative bacteria, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to form 3-day biofilms in prepared root canals. bioluminescence imaging was used to serially quantify bacterial burdens.  pdt employed a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) as the photosensitizer (ps) and 660-nm diode laser light delivered into the root canal via a 200-micro fiber, and this was compared and combined with standard endodontic treatment using mechanical debridement and antiseptic irrigation. results: endodontic therapy alone reduced bacterial bioluminescence by 90% while  pdt alone reduced bioluminescence by 95%. the combination reduced bioluminescence by >98%, and importantly the bacterial regrowth observed 24 hours after treatment was much less for the combination (p<0.0005) than for either single treatment. conclusions: bioluminescence imaging is an efficient way to monitor endodontic therapy. antimicrobial pdt may have a role to play in optimized endodontic therapy.

TI  == metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  == the synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii)] is described. the nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. in all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-o and endocyclic-n of the beta-lactam ring. the new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (a), klebsiella pneumonae (b), proteus mirabilis (c), pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), salmonella typhi (e), shigella dysentriae (f), bacillus cereus (g), corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), staphylococcus aureus (j) and streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. all compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in  normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == in vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: smart 2004 programme data.
AB  == we investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against gram-negative bacterial isolates from intensive care units (icus) in taiwan. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from icus of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam  concentration of 4 mg/l and 8 mg/l or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam had better activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/l (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/l for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/l for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). for acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant p. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and a.  baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam) isolates. results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam  are dependent on the method used. piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == using interrupted time series analysis to assess associations of fluoroquinolone  formulary changes with susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens and isolation rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolation rate. susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the mrsa isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p, 0.042) and escherichia coli (p, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising mrsa isolation rate (p, 0.001)  were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. substitution  of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in e. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in mrsa isolation rate. no associations were detected on susceptibility of  klebsiella pneumoniae or proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. these findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of mrsa may vary by both drug and organism.

TI  == antibacterial and antioxidant activities in sideritis italica (miller) greuter et burdet essential oils.
AB  == sideritis italica (miller) greuter et burdet is a widespread lamiacea in the mediterranean region used in traditional medicine. essential oils were antibacterial against nine atcc and as many clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. antibacterial activity was also found against helicobacter pylori: a dose-dependant inhibition was shown between 5 and 25 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of the oils was expressed as mics (minimum  inhibitory concentrations) and mbcs (minimum bactericidal concentrations). at a concentration between 3.9 and 250 microg/ml the oils showed a significant antibacterial effect against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in particular the atcc strains pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=3.9 microg/ml and 7.8 for flowerheads and leaves, respectively), proteus mirabilis (mic=15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml), salmonella typhi (mic=7.8 microg/ml) and proteus vulgaris (mic=15.6 microg/ml) were the most inhibited. only pseudomonas aeruginosa showed mbc at a concentration between 62.6 and 125 microg/ml. the antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated by two cell free colorimetric methods: abts and dmpd; leaf oil is more active (4.29 +/- 0.02 trolox equivalents and 4.53 +/- 0.67 ascorbic acid equivalents by abts and dmpd, respectively). finally the antioxidant activity of the essential oils was also evaluated by their effects on human whole blood leukocytes (wb) and on isolated polymorphonucleate (pmn) chemiluminescence. comparing the effects of the oils from leaves and flowerheads  on both pmn and wb chemiluminescence emission, we found no significant differences. essential oils showed a dose-dependent and linear inhibitory activity on isolated pmn as well as on wb cl emission when pma-stimulated. on the contrary, the inhibitory activity on resting cells was nonlinear. our data represent an answer to the continual demand for new antibiotics and antioxidants  for the continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the growing interest in the substitution of synthetic antioxidants with natural ones. furthermore, our finding of antibacterial and antioxidant activities in the essential oils from sideritis italica flowerheads and leaves validated the use of the plant for medical purposes.

TI  == use of chitosan bandage to prevent fatal infections developing from highly contaminated wounds in mice.
AB  == hemcon bandage is an engineered chitosan acetate preparation used as a hemostatic control dressing, and its chemical structure suggests that it should also be antimicrobial. we tested its ability to rapidly kill bacteria in vitro and in mouse models of infected wounds. we used the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis and the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus that had all been stably transduced with the entire bacterial lux operon to allow in vivo bioluminescence imaging. an excisional wound in balb/c mice was inoculated with 50-250 million cells followed after 30 min by application of hemcon bandage, alginate sponge bandage, silver sulfadiazine cream or no treatment. hemcon was more adhesive to the wound and conformed well to the injury compared to alginate. animal survival was followed over 15 days with observations of bioluminescence emission and animal activity daily. chitosan acetate treated mice infected with p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis all survived while those receiving no treatment, alginate and silver sulfadiazine demonstrated 25-100% mortality. chitosan acetate was much more effective than other treatments in rapidly reducing bioluminescence in the wound consistent with its rapid bactericidal activity in vitro as well as  its light-scattering properties. s. aureus formed only non-lethal localized infections after temporary immunosuppression of the mice but hemcon was again more effective in reducing bioluminescence. the data suggest that chitosan acetate rapidly kills bacteria in the wound before systemic invasion can take place, and is superior to alginate bandage and silver sulfadiazine that may both  encourage bacterial growth in the short term.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == use of electrochemical dna biosensors for rapid molecular identification of uropathogens in clinical urine specimens.
AB  == we describe the first species-specific detection of bacterial pathogens in human  clinical fluid samples using a microfabricated electrochemical sensor array. each of the 16 sensors in the array consisted of three single-layer gold electrodes-working, reference, and auxiliary. each of the working electrodes contained one representative from a library of capture probes, each specific for  a clinically relevant bacterial urinary pathogen. the library included probes for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterocococcus spp., and the klebsiella-enterobacter group. a bacterial 16s rrna target derived from single-step bacterial lysis was hybridized both to the biotin-modified capture probe on the sensor surface and to a second, fluorescein-modified detector probe. detection of the target-probe hybrids was achieved through binding of a horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody to the detector probe. amperometric measurement of the catalyzed hrp reaction was obtained at a fixed potential of -200 mv between the working and reference electrodes. species-specific detection of as few as 2,600 uropathogenic bacteria in culture,  inoculated urine, and clinical urine samples was achieved within 45 min from the  beginning of sample processing. in a feasibility study of this amperometric detection system using blinded clinical urine specimens, the sensor array had 100% sensitivity for direct detection of gram-negative bacteria without nucleic acid purification or amplification. identification was demonstrated for 98% of gram-negative bacteria for which species-specific probes were available. when combined with a microfluidics-based sample preparation module, the integrated system could serve as a point-of-care device for rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
AB  == chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. this question led us  to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some  ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli were used  for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used  alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin hcl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. drops were placed on whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto mueller-hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. after overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees c, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. there was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. the inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in  combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == granulomatous inflammation of salt glands in ducklings (anas platyrhynchos) associated with intralesional gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the "nasal glands" occur in many bird species and are powerful sodium ion-excretory organs. in ducks, they are located in supraorbital bony recesses. granulomatous inflammation of these glands occurs with an incidence of approximately 1% in ducklings (anas platyrhynchos), and is not associated with specific clinical symptoms. we investigated nine glands of eight animals with granulomas by gross pathology and histopathology, and compared results of bacteriology with 20 non-lesioned nasal glands. adenitis was characterized by multifocal to coalescent heterophilic granulomas with central necrotic heterophils, and multinucleate giant cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. within  the centres of the granulomas, there were clusters of gram-negative bacteria that were identified as halo-tolerant pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and aeromonas hydrophila. normal glands contained exclusively various halo-tolerant gram-positive bacteria, mostly streptococcus sp. and enterococcus sp. the distribution of lesions and lack of clinical symptoms were suggestive of a localized ascending infection via the secretory ductules.

TI  == analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at dermatology department, poznan university hospital.
AB  == effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing  leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. the  aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. the analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. the study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  == the reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. new derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such  as, o-glycidylketoxime (4) and o-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted n-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. the syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. all of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis atcc 14153 and candida albicans atcc 10231. among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-o-[2-hydroxy-3-(n-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against s. aureus atcc 6538. the compounds 2, 5b, 6b,  6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-o-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. none of the other compounds  exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria on the level of thiols in blood platelets.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, lps) activates blood platelets and stimulates generation of free radicals in these cells. the mechanism of platelet activation  induced by lps is not known. the aim of the present study was to examine how glutathione (gsh) and other thiol-containing compounds are involved in the oxidative stress in blood platelets caused by lps. the hplc technique has been used on the analysis of non-protein thiols from human blood platelets treated with lipopolysaccharides of different gram-negative bacteria (proteus mirabilis,  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). our results show that lpss caused an increase (about 10%) of the level of reduced glutathione (gsh) and other nonprotein thiols such as cysteine (csh) and cysteinylglycine (cgsh), whereas the total pool of these compounds was almost unchanged. lps may react directly with thiols, since after incubation of lpss with glutathione alone (in reduced form) we observed a distinct decrease of the level of platelet gsh.

AB  == a 67-year-old man is presented with longstanding and severe darier disease treated by topical antiseptics and potent corticosteroids, in combination with oral glucocorticoids and etretinate. after cardiac bypass surgery in 1997, the patient experienced herpes simplex virus (hsv type-1) infection of the skin that  was treated by intravenous aciclovir. in 2003, he presented a widespread atypical exacerbation of his darier disease, involving the face, trunk, buttocks, intertriginous areas and arms. initial clinical signs and bacteriological findings suggested a bacterial involvement by multiresistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. despite  antibiotherapy, the clinical presentation progressively worsened. a skin biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical examination identified a type-2 hsv infection. although intravenous aciclovir was administered, the widespread cutaneous hsv infection was followed by systemic dissemination. a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) developed, leading to a fatal issue. at autopsy, a severe interstitial type-2 hsv pneumonitis with extensive necrotic areas was found, in association with gastro-intestinal involvement. this case represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of darier disease presenting a fatal type-2 hsv infection. it underlines the importance of rapidly  recognizing hsv infection in darier disease and stresses the risk of lethal outcome. the different risk factors for hsv infection in this patient are reviewed.

AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

TI  == noninvasive biophotonic imaging for monitoring of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and therapy in mice.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired by humans, particularly in catheterized patients. a major problem with catheterization is the formation of bacterial biofilms on catheter material and the risk of developing persistent utis that are difficult to monitor and eradicate. to better understand the course of utis and allow more accurate studies of in vivo antibiotic efficacy, we developed a catheter-based biofilm infection model with mice, using bioluminescently engineered bacteria. two important urinary tract pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis,  were made bioluminescent by stable insertion of a complete lux operon. segments of catheter material (precolonized or postimplant infected) with either pathogen  were placed transurethrally in the lumen of the bladder by using a metal stylet without surgical manipulation. the bioluminescent strains were sufficiently bright to be readily monitored from the outside of infected animals, using a low-light optical imaging system, including the ability to trace the ascending pattern of light-emitting bacteria through ureters to the kidneys. placement of the catheter in the bladder not only resulted in the development of strong cystitis that persisted significantly longer than in mice challenged with bacterial suspensions alone but also required prolonged antibiotic treatment to reduce the level of infection. treatment of infected mice for 4 days with ciprofloxacin at 30 mg/kg of body weight twice a day cured cystitis and renal infection in noncatheterized mice. similarly, ciprofloxacin reduced the bacterial burden to undetectable levels in catheterized mice but did not inhibit rebound of the infection upon cessation of antibiotic therapy. this methodology easily allows spatial information to be monitored sequentially throughout the entire disease process, including ascending uti, treatment efficacy, and relapse, all without exogenous sampling, which is not possible with conventional methods.

TI  == bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  == aims: the polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. in addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is  assessed. methods: this is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in adan teaching hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. the patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. the specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. result: staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of  cases. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and proteus mirabilis  (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly bacteroides fragilis. imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive  organisms. conclusion: s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. these wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.

TI  == malignant mimickers: chronic bacterial and fungal infections of the larynx.
AB  == chronic infections of the larynx are notorious "copycats" of squamous cell carcinoma. patients typically present with a historical picture and symptoms identical to those seen in a neoplastic setting: dyspnea, hoarseness, odynophagia, weight loss, and a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse. historically, these patients were subject to an extensive resection for what was  in reality a benign disease. a better understanding and awareness of these conditions has reinforced the need for a direct laryngoscopy, biopsy, and culture in the evaluation of long-lasting laryngeal lesions; this has led to more appropriate and focused treatment. the clinical mimicry of chronic laryngeal infections will be illustrated in two recent case reports, histoplasmosis and botryomycosis of the larynx, which will lead into a discussion on the differential diagnosis of bacterial and fungal laryngeal infections, their evaluation, and treatment options.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == (1)h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  == the utility of (1)h nmr spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (uti). the specific property of p. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-ohna) is exploited. the quantity of 6-ohna produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. the method provides a single-step documentation of p. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. the nmr method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with uti caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of ibafloxacin in micro-organisms isolated from cats.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of ibafloxacin were investigated in micro-organisms isolated from cats. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ibafloxacin (racemate, r- and s-enantiomers) and its metabolites (7-hydroxy- and  8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin) and time-kill kinetics were determined against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria isolated from dermal and respiratory and urinary tract infections in cats. racemic ibafloxacin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. escherichia coli and pasteurella, klebsiella and staphylococcus spp. are commonly isolated from feline infections and all are susceptible to ibafloxacin (mic90 < or = 0.5 microg/ml), whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus spp. are considered intrinsic resistant. microbiological activity resides primarily in the s-enantiomer of ibafloxacin whereas the r-enantiomer is  less active. killing curves using concentrations of racemic ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which are representative of the in vivo situation observed in cats, showed at least 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial isolates from feline clinical samples over 24 h. bacterial eradication was achieved in cats with cmax/mic and auc/mic values much lower than the target values previously established in man and laboratory animals. additional studies in dogs and cats are necessary to define more clearly the surrogate markers of antibacterial activity (i.e. cmax/mic, auc/mic ratios), which are associated with a good clinical response.

TI  == longitudinal trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities across long-term-care facilities: emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance in the longterm-care facility (ltcf) setting is of increasing concern due to both the increased morbidity and mortality related to infections in this debilitated population and the potential for transfer of resistant organisms to other healthcare settings. longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance in ltcfs have not been well described. design: correlational longitudinal survey study. setting: four ltcfs in pennsylvania. subjects: all clinical cultures of residents of the participating ltcfs (700 total beds) from 1998 through 2003. we assessed the annual prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials of interest for the following organisms: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus species. results: a total of  4,954 clinical isolates were obtained during the study. a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted for many organism-drug combinations. this was  especially true for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae (susceptibility range, 51.3% to 92.2%). in addition, the prevalence of resistance to various agents differed significantly across study sites. finally, significant increasing trends in resistance were noted over time and were most pronounced for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae. conclusions: the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has increased significantly in ltcfs, although trends have varied substantially across different institutions. these trends have been particularly pronounced for fluoroquinolone resistance among the enterobacteriaceae. these findings demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance is widespread and increasing in ltcfs, highlighting the need for future studies to more clearly elucidate the risk factors for, and potential interventions against, emerging resistance in these settings.

TI  == rapid, species-specific detection of uropathogen 16s rdna and rrna at ambient temperature by dot-blot hybridization and an electrochemical sensor array.
AB  == development of rapid molecular approaches for pathogen detection is key to improving treatment of infectious diseases. for this study, the kinetics and temperature-dependence of dna probe hybridization to uropathogen species-specific sequences were examined. a set of oligonucleotide probes were designed based on variable regions of the 16s gene of the escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a universal bacterial probe and probes-specific for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also included. the oligonucleotide probes discriminated among 16s genes derived from 11 different species of uropathogenic bacteria applied to nylon membranes in a dot-blot format. significant binding of oligonucleotide probes to target dna and  removal of nonspecific binding by membrane washing could both be achieved rapidly, requiring as little as 10 min. an oligonucleotide probe from the same species-specific region of the e. coli 16s gene was used as a capture probe in a  novel electrochemical 16-sensor array based on microfabrication technology. sequence-specific hybridization of target uropathogen 16s rdna was detected through horseradish peroxidase acting as an electrochemical transducer via a second, detector probe. the sensor array demonstrated rapid, species-specific hybridization in a time course consistent with the rapid kinetics of the dot-blot hybridization studies. as in the dot-blot hybridization studies, species-specific detection of bacterial nucleic acids using the sensor array approach was demonstrated both at 65 degrees c and at room temperature. these results demonstrate that molecular hybridization approaches can be adapted to rapid, room temperature conditions ideal for an electrochemical sensor array platform.

TI  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  == escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis), followed by staphylococcus spp. especially staphylococcus saprophyticus, and proteus mirabilis. against e. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated uti, faropenem was the most effective. up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated uti, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. various types of organisms were isolated in patients  with complicated uti. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  were the three most frequent organisms isolated. these three organisms accounted  for 44.6%. amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against e. coli followed by cephems. the rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant e. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. about 17% of pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all e. faecalis isolates; about 60% of enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. the rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. utis caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) are rare in japan.

TI  == poly(vinyl chloride)-coated sol-gels for studying the effects of nitric oxide release on bacterial adhesion.
AB  == nitric oxide (no) releasing sol-gel materials coated with poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc) films exhibit increased stability at ambient and physiological temperatures. the polymer overcoat, however, reduces the no fluxes by 5-35% over  the initial week of release. the variation in no fluxes between unmodified and pvc-coated sol-gels is negligible after 7 days. the pvc polymeric layer provides  controlled surface chemistry for systematic studies of the effects of no release  on bacterial adhesion. as an example, the adhesion of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  proteus mirabilis at pvc-coated no-releasing sol-gels is investigated. a direct no dependence on the reduction of p. aeruginosa adhesion is observed for no fluxes up to 20 pmol cm(-2) s(-1). although decreased by 50% in the presence of no release, p. mirabilis adhesion does not appear to correlate to the flux of no  release. pvc-coated no-releasing sol-gels may prove useful for studying the effects of localized no release on other biological and chemical systems.

TI  == [bacterial infections in chronic otitis media--usefulness of molecular diagnostics based on pcr method].
AB  == infections in chronic otitis media (com) are common, and identification of their  pathogen is difficult, what is proven by high rate of negative results of bacteriological examinations. this fact may be explained by two factors: it is difficult to obtain a reliable material for culture and classic methods of bacteriological cultures may be of low sensitivity. amplification of bacterial dna in pcr is an examination, that leads to a higher effectiveness and sensitivity of bacteriological tests. the authors present material of 53 patients with com, previously untreated, in which bacteriological examinations by classic  and molecular pcr method were performed. the results of both methods were compared. in classic method the presence of pathogens was observed in 46 of 53 cases (86.8%). the most often isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.8% of the cases), staphylococcus aureus (15.1%), peptostreptococcus sp. and fusobacterium sp. (11.3% of the cases each) and proteus mirabilis (7.5%). in 7 cases (13.2%) bacteriological results were negative. using molecular diagnostic of pcr, the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 42 cases (79.2%).  isolated strains of p. aeruginosa were epidemiologically unrelated (93.7% of isolates), what was proven in pcr-finger-printing technique. the authors stated that predominant aerobes pathogens in com are p. aeruginosa and s. aureus and the pcr technique for identification of bacterial dna presence is very sensitive and  allows to precipitate diagnostics of patients with com. combination of classical  bacteriological tests with pcr technique may be very helpful in estimation bacteriological condition of patients with com.

TI  == frequency and diversity of class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in hospitals of the auvergne, france: a 2 year prospective study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) produced by enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in one french region. methods: during 2001-2002, all the non-duplicate isolates of p. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate  or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime and/or aminoglycosides with an aac(6') i phenotype were collected in nine hospitals of the area. esbl isoelectric points were determined, bla genes were amplified and sequenced and epidemic isolates were genotyped with eric2-pcr. results: esbls were observed in  297 enterobacteriaceae (0.8%). the most frequent were tem-3 like (n=152; 51.2%) and tem-24 (n=115; 38.7%). four new enzymes were observed, tem-112 (pi 5.4), tem-113 (pi 6.3), tem-114 (pi 5.9) and tem-126 (pi 5.4). other tems were tem-8, tem-12, tem-16, tem-19, tem-20, tem-21, tem-29 and tem-71. the other esbls were shv-4, shv-5 and shv-12, ctx-m-1, ctx-m-3, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15. in 37 p. aeruginosa (0.7%) only one esbl was observed, per-1. five epidemic strains were detected, serratia marcescens tem-3 and four observed in several hospitals, enterobacter aerogenes tem-24, citrobacter koseri tem-3, proteus mirabilis tem-3  and p. aeruginosa per-1. conclusion: esbl frequency was lower than in 1998, and ctx-m-type frequency higher (2.1% of esbls in 2001, 4.9% in 2002). this long-term survey detected new sporadic enzymes (tem-112, tem-113, tem-114 and tem-126) and  interhospital epidemic strains while avoiding any overestimation of esbl frequency that may otherwise have occurred because of acute epidemics.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == metalloantibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of cobalt(ii), copper(ii), nickel(ii) and zinc(ii) complexes of kefzol.
AB  == kefzol (kzl), a beta-lactam antibiotic, possesses various donor sites for interaction with transition metal(ii) ions [co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii)] to form complexes of the type [m(kzl)2]cl2 and [m(kzl)cl], with molar ratio of metal: ligand (m:l) of 1:2 and 1:1 respectively. these complexes were prepared and characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. their ir and nmr  spectra suggest that kefzol potentially acts as a bidentate, tridentate as well as monoanionic tetradentate ligand. the complexes have been screened for antibacterial activity and results were compared with the activity of the uncomplexed antibiotic against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. the metal complexes were found to be more potent against one or more bacterial species than the uncomplexed kefzol.

TI  == prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. in all, 45 male wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. a small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. in the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. in the second group, a disc, which was saturated with staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. in the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. the silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. there was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. in the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of s. epidermidis in two and  proteus mirabilis in the remaining. three and four cultures were positive in the  second and third group, respectively. low colonies of four different organisms (escherichia coli, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. there was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == objective: to determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in yaounde, cameroon. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at yaounde central hospital between march 1995 and april 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). results: of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were enterobacteriaceae. a high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. the proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly  higher than that from outpatients (p < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. the rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. among enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in e. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most  important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). wild type (exclusively observed in e. coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; p < 0.05). however, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (klebsiella spp. (3.5%), e. coli (2.6%), citrobacter spp. (0.7%), enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and p.  mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). however, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. conclusion: as the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.

AB  == moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. in this study the activity of moxifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive and  gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of s. pneumoniae, m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 x mic of moxifloxacin. in conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

AB  == in this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between january 2002 and may 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. we isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were staphylococcus aureus, 19 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 escherichia coli, 4 proteus mirabilis, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 2 serratia marcescens, 2 streptococcus group g und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. moreover we identified one patient with candida parapsilosis. therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. consequently, 30.4% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were orsa strains. all of the orsa isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the orsa-positive patients. in the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. beside the obligate resistance  to oxacillin, penicillin g, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the orsa was sensitive to ofloxacin. the results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of orsa.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == [catheter-related urinary infections at the clinical center in banja luka].
AB  == introduction: catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infections of the urinary tract, and among the most common nosocomial  infections in general. the major problems of these infections include antibiotic  resistance and enormous direct and indirect cost of treatment. material and methods: a retrospective study on major causes of infections and antibiotic resistance was conducted at four clinics of the clinical center of banja luka. an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to nursing staff dealing with urinary catheters in order to get an overview of their clinical performance. results: the results showed that in 89% of cases (out of 198 patients with developed catheter-associated urinary tract infection) infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria, in 7% by gram-positive bacteria and in 4% by candida. the most common bacteria were: escherichia coli (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.1%), proteus mirabilis (13.3%), and enterobacter (10.5%). majority of bacteria presented with extremely high resistance (72-100%) to ampicillin, gentamycin and cotrimoxazole, and in some cases a significant resistance to ciproflaxacine, nalidixic acid, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. the questionnaire showed that nursing staff did not follow guidelines for medical care of patients  with urinary catheters. conclusion: it can be concluded that poor hygienic and epidemiological conditions, as well as irrational use of antibiotics contribute to uncontrolled development of urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.

TI  == results from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme: report of the 2001 data from 15 united states medical centres.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is an international surveillance network of more than 100 medical centres where meropenem is the primary therapeutic carbapenem. institutions have  been monitored since 1997 (1999 in united states (us)) using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) reference susceptibility methods to monitor in vitro activity of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. in 2001, a total of 2874 strains were processed from the 15 us medical centres. molecular methods were associated with mic methods as needed  for defining epidemic spread of resistant strains. the meropenem mic(90) values were 0.03 mg/l for citrobacter spp., escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.; 0.06 mg/l for proteus mirabilis and serratia spp. and 0.12 mg/l for enterobacter spp.  this potency was 8-16-fold greater than that of imipenem and the meropenem spectrum of activity versus the enterobacteriaceae was the broadest of all tested antimicrobial agents. only piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(9), 64 mg/l) and tobramycin (mic(90), 4 mg/l) were active against more than 90.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa at the nccls susceptible breakpoint, and the carbapenems were the most active compounds against acinetobacter spp. however, acinetobacter spp. isolates  were resistant to all of the antimicrobial agents tested and the molecular typing results suggested that they were epidemiologically related. only ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime had significantly reduced activity against oxacillin-susceptible  staphylococci (87.9-92.6% susceptible. these 2001 us mystic programme results demonstrated no significant decline in carbapenem activity or susceptibility rates compared with the previously monitored years (1999-2000). most apparent were the decreasing susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime against staphylococci. continued surveillance in these institutions appears warranted as sites of high potential emerging resistance risk.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers  showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but  only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only  67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial  drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.

AB  == in europe, the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs is determined with a quantitative suspension test (pren 12054) and a test under practical conditions (en 1500). another test method has recently been published by the german society for hygiene and microbiology (dghm) with four differences to the european system in the in vitro tests: additional qualitative suspension tests with product dilutions to the ineffective range; a selection of the most resistant gram-negative test strains in the qualitative suspension test, which should be used adjacent to pseudomonas aeruginosa in the quantitative suspension  test; a high organic load in the quantitative suspension tests (0.3% albumin and  0.3% sheep erythrocytes); and an aqueous control in the quantitative suspension test. according to dghm, the in vitro tests should be followed by en 1500. we have determined the antimicrobial efficacy of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs according to both methods. pren 12054 was carried out without organic load. the qualitative suspension tests (dghm) were carried out with p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae and candida albicans. the quantitative suspension test (dghm)  was carried out with product dilutions of 75%, 50% and 25%, and a high organic load using the following test organisms: p. aeruginosa, p. mirabilis (one product only), s. aureus, e. hirae and c. albicans. all these suspension tests were carried out in quadruplicate with each product and exposure time. en 1500 was carried out with 3 ml of each product and an application time of 30 s. all three  products achieved the required bactericidal activity of pren 12054 and the new dghm method within 30 s, and were equally effective with the reference hand disinfection of en 1500 within 30 s. in our study, the dghm test method did not provide additional information for hand rubs which exhibit their bactericidal efficacy with 3 ml within 30 s (en 1500).

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

AB  == in the present study, we examined the in vitro effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid (lower than normal plasma levels), on the adherence of five microbial strains (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) of healthy volunteers. the study reached the following conclusions: 1) the presence of ascorbic acid significantly reduces the ability of all tested strains (with the exception of klebsiella pneumoniae) to adhere to  bec; 2) ascorbic acid interacts with the epithelial cells and decreases the adherence of all tested microorganisms. these findings may be of potential clinical significance.

TI  == diagnosis, treatment and registration of urinary tract infections in geriatric patients.
AB  == bacteriuria (> or = 10(5) cfu/ml) is a very common phenomenon in elderly people,  occurring twice as frequently in women than in men. there are symptomatic and asymptomatic types of bacteriuria. risk factors include: a decrease in the estrogen level in women after the menopause, catheterisation, urinary bladder dysfunction, hypertrophy of the prostate gland, diabetes, neurological illnesses. the diagnosis of bacteriuria is based on quantitative urine culture (positive result--> or = 10(5) cfu/ml bacteriae). the most frequent pathogens are: e. coli, enterococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis. the antimicrobial therapy is not advised for asymptomatic bacteriuria. in the case of symptomatic bacteriuria it is advised to take urine for culture and to perform sensitivity testing as well as blood culture and to start a "blind therapy". in order to use the antimicrobial treatment effectively, the most frequently occurring pathogens should be registered and their sensitivity patterns in the given hospital recognised.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == enhanced microbial biomass assay using mutant luciferase resistant to benzalkonium chloride.
AB  == in a biomass assay based on adenosine 5(')-triphosphate (atp) bioluminescence, extracellular atp is removed; then intracellular atp is extracted from the microorganism by an atp extractant and subsequently reacted with luciferase. to provide a highly sensitive assay, the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (bac) in the atp extractant was optimized by using a mutant luciferase resistant  to bac. the use of 0.2% bac, which was acceptable for the luciferase, simultaneously achieved the maximum extraction of intracellular atp from microorganisms and the inactivation of the atp-eliminating enzymes for removal of extracellular atp. the detection limit (blank+3 sd) for atp was 1.8x10(-14)m (1.8x10(-18)mol/assay) in the presence of the atp extractant with coefficients of variation of 0.7 to 6.3%. the reagent system coupled with the atp-eliminating enzymes allowed for the detection of 93 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of escherichia coli atcc 25922, 170cfu/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 170cfu/ml of proteus mirabilis atcc 29906, 68cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, and 7.7cfu/ml of bacillus subtilis atcc 6051. the yeast cell of saccharomyces cerevisiae ifo 10217 could be detected at 1cfu/ml. with 54 kinds of microorganisms, the average atp extraction efficiency compared to the trichloroacetic acid extraction method was 81.0% in 24 strains among gram-negative bacteria, 99.4% in 13 strains among gram-positive bacteria, and 97.0% in 17 strains among yeast. the atp contents of the gram-negative bacteria,  gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts ranged from 0.40 to 2.70x10(-18)mol/cfu (mean=1.5x10(-18)mol/cfu), from 0.41 to 16.7x10(-18)mol/cfu (mean=5.5x10(-18)mol/cfu), and from 0.714 to 54.6x10(-16)mol/cfu (mean=8.00x10(-16)mol/cfu), respectively.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance patterns among urine isolates from patients in a geriatric hospital and from older patients in a general hospital in jerusalem.
AB  == introduction and rationale: urinary tract infection is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in patients hospitalized in chronic care facilities. the changing spectrum of microorganisms involved in urinary tract infections and the  emerging resistance require continuous monitoring to provide crucial information  to guide empirical therapy and encourage prudent use of antibiotics. the aim of this survey was to assess the antimicrobial resistance profile of urine isolates  from patients hospitalized in a geriatric hospital and from elderly patients hospitalized in an acute care hospital in order to guide empirical therapy of urinary tract infections. methods: the survey was performed in two hospitals in jerusalem: a university-affiliated geriatric hospital- herzog -and an acute secondary- and tertiary-care university hospital- hadassah. we performed a retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance of all positive urine cultures obtained from patients in the geriatric division of herzog hospital and from patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized in the internal medicine departments in hadassah hospital during a 1-year period. results: the most common bacteria isolated from urine specimens in herzog hospital were, in order of frequency, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we demonstrated a high rate of antimicrobial resistance of those bacteria in both hospitals. the pattern we observed necessitates recommending ceftazidime as the most appropriate empirical therapy for urinary tract infection in herzog hospital. in hadassah hospital we recommend cefuroxime for those patients in good general condition and ceftazidime for those who present with clinical sepsis. antimicrobial resistance patterns should be assessed periodically and recommendations modified accordingly. infection control guidelines should be implemented in order to try to decrease the rate of antimicrobial resistance. further research is requested to assess the efficacy of such interventions in long-term care facilities.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

AB  == a nationwide 6-year surveillance of resistance in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical specimens  of patients from ten intensive care units and ten urology services was started in 1995. mics of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole,  norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin were determined by broth microdilution. intensive care units had higher resistance levels of amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor and ceftazidime (p<0.005) and lower resistance levels of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole and quinolones (p<0.01) than urology services. changes in mic distributions in time and development of resistant clusters were observed for nitrofurantoin (e. coli), amoxycillin (e. coli, p. mirabilis), amoxycillin/clavulanate (e. coli) and for quinolones (e. coli). the overall resistance level of ceftazidime and gentamicin  was <5%, but this fluctuated with the appearance and disappearance of resistant clones in some intensive care units. quinolone resistance among p. aeruginosa from intensive care units fluctuated between 7 and 14%.

AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == susceptibility patterns of orally administered antimicrobials among urinary tract infection pathogens from hospitalized patients in north america: comparison report to europe and latin america. results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2000).
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) remain a worldwide nosocomial infection problem.  geographic variations in pathogen occurrence and susceptibility profiles require  monitoring to provide information to guide new (garenoxacin [bms284756]) therapeutic options. two thousand seven hundred-eighty uti isolates from europe (n = 783), latin america (531), and north america (1,466) were tested and compared against 44 agents by reference methods in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the top seven pathogens accounted for 90% of all isolates and the rank order for all regions was: escherichia coli (1,316; 47%), enterococcus spp. (351; 13%), klebsiella spp. (306; 11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (210; 8%), proteus mirabilis (145; 5%), enterobacter spp. (97; 4%), and citrobacter spp. (78; 3%). the pathogen rank order was similar among regions except for the rarer occurrence of enterococcus spp. (rank #6, 4%) in latin america. e. coli ampicillin resistance was highest in europe and latin america (51-55%). ampicillin (37%), ciprofloxacin or garenoxacin (4%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (23%) resistance remained lowest in north america.  nitrofurantoin susceptibility in e. coli was still at acceptable levels and ranged from 91 to 96% across regions. the regional ciprofloxacin-resistant rank order for p. aeruginosa by region was: latin america (55%) > europe (41%) > north america (29%). vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) were only detected in north america (7%). garenoxacin possessed a 34 to 44% wider spectrum compared to ciprofloxacin against enterococci uti isolates. extended spectrum beta-lactamase  rates for e. coli and klebsiella spp. were 4 and 19%, respectively. these results emphasized the need to assess the often striking differences in pathogen occurrence and resistance rates among the commonly encountered uti pathogens.

TI  == treatment of gram-negative folliculitis in patients with acne.
AB  == gram-negative folliculitis may be the result of long-term antibacterial treatment in acne patients. it is caused by bacterial interference and replacement of the gram-positive flora of the facial skin and the mucous membranes of the nose and infestation with gram-negative bacteria. these gram-negative bacteria include escherischia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marescens, klebsiella and proteus mirabilis. the occurrence of gram-negative folliculitis should be considered in acne patients in whom oral treatment with tetracyclines has not resulted in a significant improvement of acne lesions after 3-6 months' treatment. the occurrence of gram-negative folliculitis in acne patients is believed to be generally underestimated, since correct sampling and bacteriology  is rarely performed by clinicians. gram-negative folliculitis in acne and rosacea patients is best treated with isotretinoin (0.5-1 mg/kg daily for 4-5 months).

AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (utis) in the uk to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. method: during 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing uti were collected from 8 centres in the uk. isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired uti in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired uti other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired uti in those greater than 65 years old (392). after re-identification, mics for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using nccls procedures and interpretive guidelines. results: escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the  total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). the next three pathogens  of importance were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. the activity of amoxycillin against e. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). cefuroxime was very active against e. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). cefuroxime was inactive against  enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas spp. nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of e. coli (96.3% susceptible) and e. faecalis but not against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. ciprofloxacin was highly active against the uti pathogens examined in this study  with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (e. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against pseudomonas spp. conclusion: these data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing uti in the uk.

TI  == development of resistant bacteria isolated from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections after exposure to enrofloxacin in vitro.
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations for enrofloxacin were determined for 63 bacterial isolates from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections. development of resistant mutants was determined after exposing the isolates to enrofloxacin in vitro for up to five serial passages. results indicated that pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus spp isolates exposed to enrofloxacin developed resistance rapidly, whereas klebsiella, proteus, and streptococcus spp  were less likely to develop resistance. despite the presence of enrofloxacin pressure, no resistant bacteria developed in the escherichia coli and staphylococcal isolates. in many isolates, susceptibility patterns changed from susceptible to intermediate.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == urinary tract infection trends in latin american hospitals: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. the objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in latin america between 1997 to 2000 through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. in the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. the patients' mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6%). esherichia coli was the  most frequent pathogen isolated followed by klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. among the e. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious uti in latin america (91.0-100.0% susceptible). high resistance rates to fluoroquinolones (17.5-18.9%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (>45.0%) were observed among the e. coli. in contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility  rate of > 87.0%. against klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (>30.0%) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). even the new fluoroquinolones showed limited activity against klebsiella spp. (72.1-88.6% susceptible) and the p. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most  antimicrobial agents tested. the results of this survey endorse the importance of enterobacteriaceae as cause of uti in latin america. our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the latin american medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region.

TI  == necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum.
AB  == background: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum is a fulminant, life-threatening condition. this infection is usually polymicrobial and may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or surgery. histologically, it is characterized by obliterative endarteritis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous vessels, fascial necrosis, and leukocytic infiltration. mortality rates of 25-75% have been reported. most cases of necrotizing gangrene begin insidiously, with scrotal discomfort and malaise. later, erythema, increasing pain, and swelling, associated with fever and chills, develop. a biopsy is useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to obtain culture samples. ultrasound imaging may reveal gas or testicular involvement and may help to distinguish this infection from other causes of scrotal pathology. materials and methods: fifteen patients with necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum, seen at the dermatology and plastic surgery sections of our institutions between 1994 and 1999, are described. results: this series included 11 men (73%) and four women (27%), aged  39-68 years (mean, 51 years). in our series, clostridium perfingens, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus viridans, acinetobacter baumani, escherichia coli, and candida albicans were isolated. hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring were performed in all patients. intravenous antimicrobial therapy was promptly instituted. in most cases, two or more drugs were used. concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was always required. when needed, split-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the penile shaft. expanded mesh grafts were used to reconstruct the vulva and other denuded beds. the survival rate in this series was 87%. conclusions: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. the usual polymicrobial infection with vascular involvement demands hemodynamic stabilization, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement. in some patients, genital, perineal, and abdominal wall reconstruction is also required.

TI  == susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria to biocides: a perspective from the study of catheter biofilms.
AB  == bacteria resistant to both the agents deployed to prevent infections and those used to treat infections would be formidable nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this paper is to review the evidence that gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics and biocides have emerged and been responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection. a study of patients undergoing intermittent bladder catheterization revealed that the frequent application of the antiseptic chlorhexidine to the perineal skin prior to the insertion of the catheter was effective against the normal gram-positive skin flora but not against the gram-negative organisms that subsequently colonized this site. organisms such as providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were repeatedly isolated from the skin of these patients and inevitably went on to cause urinary infections. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chlorhexidine for many of these strains proved to be 200-800 microg ml(-1) compared with the 10-50 microg ml(-1) recorded for reference strains of gram-negative species. a subsequent survey of over 800 gram-negative isolates from urinary tract infections in patients from both hospitals and the community revealed that chlorhexidine resistance was not a widespread phenomenon, but was restricted to these species and to units where the care of catheterized patients  involved the extensive use of chlorhexidine. analysis of the antibiotic resistance patterns revealed that the chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also multidrug resistant. other clinical studies also reported catheter-associated infections with chlorhexidine- and multidrug-resistant strains of pr. mirabilis when chlorhexidine was being used extensively. this species poses particular problems to the catheterized patient. chlorhexidine thus proved counterproductive in the care of catheters and its use in this context has been largely abandoned.  suggestions of reintroducing this agent in the form of biocide-impregnated catheters should be resisted.

TI  == modification of dienes mutual inhibition test for epidemiological characterization of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of community-associated and nosocomial infections related to exposure to aqueous environments. such infections often occur in the setting of a common-source outbreak, in which case  epidemiological characterization of isolates may be necessary. in this preliminary study, a modification of the dienes mutual inhibition test, ordinarily used to assess the relatedness of swarming proteus mirabilis strains,  was used to study 15 p. aeruginosa isolates, with the results compared to those obtained by ribotype analysis. complete concordance was noted between the results of the dienes test and those of ribotyping. these observations suggest that further studies are warranted to assess the utility of the modified dienes test as a simple, inexpensive, and reliable means for epidemiological typing of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
AB  == we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (pzfx mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following  results. 1) the mic50 and mic90 values of pzfx against clinically isolated gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. pzfx showed broad spectrum activity. the antibacterial activities of pzfx against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (ipm/cs)-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (caz), ceftriaxone,  ipm/cs, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) pzfx showed superior bactericidal  activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa to those of caz and ipm/cs after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) caz and ipm/cs had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of mic against p. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear  leucocytes, while pzfx exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) pzfx inhibited both dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from s. aureus at nearly the same level. pzfx showed poor inhibitory activity  against topoisomerase ii from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) pzfx mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of caz with following infection model caused by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa  or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, cmc pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) intravenous administration of pzfx with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c.  administration.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 2000 and july 2001. then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 511 strains. the  breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and gram-negative  bacteria as 71.0%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. no increase in low-susceptible strains of e. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. vcm showed a  strong activity against mrsa preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. in addition, the activity of arbekacin (abk) was strong with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa and prevented growth of all strains with 4  micrograms/ml. abk showed a strong activity against staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. abpc, cefotiam (ctm) and  cefozopran (czop) also showed a relatively strong activity against s. epidermidis (mic90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). against escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high  activities: meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; ipm prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. czop and ctm also showed strong activities against e. coli: mic90 of czop was within 0.125 microgram/ml; mic80 and mic90 of ctm were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. quinolone resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and mepm prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. the mic90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (gm) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more  than 32 micrograms/ml. against serratia marcescens, the mic90 of ipm and gm were  the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of mepm was 4 micrograms/ml.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

AB  == a colony of knockout mice (gene designation cybb tm1) has been maintained at this institution for 5 years. these mice are lacking the b subunit of nadph oxidase and are susceptible to experimental infection with aspergillus fumigatus. the purpose of this study was to document the spontaneous diseases present in these mice which are a murine model of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease and to compare these lesions to those of chronic granulomatous disease in humans. lesions were documented in 72 mice submitted to the necropsy service. all 72 mice had an acidophilic macrophage pneumonia, and 16 also had lobar suppurative and necrotizing pneumonias caused by paecilomyces sp. (11 of the 16 mice), a. fumigatus (3 mice), rhizopus sp. (1 mouse), or candida guilliermondii (1 mouse).  of the 72 animals, 36 had severe bacterial suppurative and necrotizing to pyogranulomatous pneumonias; lung abscesses yielded cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), enterococcus (n = 6), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), s. xylosus (n = 1), coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (n = 4), gram-negative enteric bacilli (n = 6), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and proteus mirabilis (n  = 2). thirteen mice had a necrotizing and suppurative adenitis of the cervical lymph nodes caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp.; s. aureus, s. xylosus, and s. equorum were recovered from abscesses in the cervical lymph nodes, extremities, and head. splenomegaly was found in 30 animals and lymphadenopathy in 11 mice. the array of spontaneously occurring infectious diseases and lesions in these mice is similar to that of human patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

TI  == characterization of flagella produced by clinical strains of stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
AB  == stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen associated with opportunistic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and hiv. adherence of this organism to abiotic surfaces such as medical implants and catheters represents a major risk for hospitalized patients. the adhesive surface factors involved in adherence of these bacteria are largely unknown, and their flagella have not yet been characterized biochemically and antigenically. we purified and characterized the flagella produced by s. maltophilia clinical strains. the flagella filaments are composed of a 38-kda subunit, sm(flic), and analysis of its n-terminal amino acid sequence showed considerable sequence identity to the flagellins of serratia marcescens (78.6%), escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei (71.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.2%). ultrastructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy of bacteria adhering to  plastic showed flagellalike structures within the bacterial clusters, suggesting  that flagella are produced as the bacteria spread on the abiotic surface.

TI  == [effectiveness of imipenem/cilastatin (tienam, msd) in treating complicated infections in urology].
AB  == complicated urinary infections tend to eventuate in severe pyoseptic complications--bacteriuria, sepsis. the search for methods of fighting agents of  urinary infections goes in the direction of perfection of already existing methods and in the direction of design of novel antibacterial drugs. in the middle 1980s the first carbapenem drug-imipenem--was proposed for urological clinical practice. mechanism of its action as that of the other beta-lactam antibiotics consists in impairment of synthesis of bacterial cell wall as a result of the drug penetration through the surface membrane and irreversible binding with penicillin-binding proteins. imipenem is active against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms which cause  severe urological infections. the article presents the results of treatment of 45 patients with severe urological infections with multiple resistance of the causing agent and failure of previous treatment. imipenem was given in a daily dose 1.5-2.0 g. sometimes a stepwise regimen was used: 500 mg 4 times a day intravenously for the first 3-4 days, then 500 mg twice a day intramuscularly for the following 3-4 days. in detection of highly sensitive bacteria (e. coli, proteus mirabilis) daily doses were reduced to 1 g. in long standing infection caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa imipenem was combined with amicacin. in high surgical risk of postoperative period imipenem was given prior to surgery and continued after it for 5 to 14 days. good therapeutic results were achieved: clinical effect reached 95.5%, antibacterial efficiency was 87.8%. thus, imipenem is antibiotic of the first line in empirical therapy of severe bacterial infections in urology as it has a wide spectrum of antibacterial action. we believe that this drug should not be left as a reserve but used for a starting empirical therapy of severe infections in urological hospital.

TI  == resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (uti) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence  of resistant bacteria isolated from uti. resistant isolates are more frequent in  long-term care populations than the community. resistant isolates include common  uropathogens, such as escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or providencia stuartii. isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. the increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. in particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. this permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting  organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. collected from a major teaching hospital in taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. the overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. isolates of escherichia coli and morganella morganii  proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. by 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. activity against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. interestingly, some strains of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in taiwan. this resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of s. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. after the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the p. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was  not due to the spread of a single clone. we conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in taiwan, especially in recent years. appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria to biocides: a perspective from the study of catheter biofilms.
AB  == bacteria resistant to both the agents deployed to prevent infections and those used to treat infections would be formidable nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this paper is to review the evidence that gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics and biocides have emerged and been responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection. a study of patients undergoing intermittent bladder catheterization revealed that the frequent application of the antiseptic chlorhexidine to the perineal skin prior to the insertion of the catheter was effective against the normal gram-positive skin flora but not against the gram-negative organisms that subsequently colonized this site. organisms such as providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were repeatedly isolated from the skin of these patients and inevitably went on to cause urinary infections. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chlorhexidine for many of these strains proved to be 200-800 microg ml(-1) compared with the 10-50 microg ml(-1) recorded for reference strains of gram-negative species. a subsequent survey of over 800 gram-negative isolates from urinary tract infections in patients from both hospitals and the community revealed that chlorhexidine resistance was not a widespread phenomenon, but was restricted to these species and to units where the care of catheterized patients  involved the extensive use of chlorhexidine. analysis of the antibiotic resistance patterns revealed that the chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also multidrug resistant. other clinical studies also reported catheter-associated infections with chlorhexidine- and multidrug-resistant strains of pr. mirabilis when chlorhexidine was being used extensively. this species poses particular problems to the catheterized patient. chlorhexidine thus proved counterproductive in the care of catheters and its use in this context has been largely abandoned.  suggestions of reintroducing this agent in the form of biocide-impregnated catheters should be resisted.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

AB  == the objective of this study was to identify the causative agent of cellulitis in  turkeys. eighteen flocks from nine producers were sampled at the local processing plant, and 37 birds with cellulitis on legs or caudal thoracic area were obtained. none of the 37 birds with cellulitis had lesions in other organs. on gross examination, lesions were categorized into two groups: cellulitis with unopened skin lesions (type a) and cellulitis with opened skin lesions (type b).  histopathologically, cellulitis with unopened skin lesions had dermal necrosis with underlying fibrin and inflammatory exudate but cellulitis with open skin lesions had chronic granulomatous/granulation tissue-type reaction associated with foreign material. a complete bacteriologic study was conducted on 25 of 37 birds. bacteria were isolated from 12 of the 25 birds with cellulitis lesions. no aerobic, microaerophilic, or anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the remaining  13 birds with cellulitis lesions. escherichia coli was isolated in low numbers in mixed cultures with proteus mirabilis, lactobacillus spp., klebsiella spp., and staphylococcus spp. in 9 of 12 lesions. the remaining few cases yielded p. mirabilis in pure culture or in mixed culture with pseudomonas aeruginosa. types  a and b cellulitis lesions in turkeys could be associated with primary contact dermatitis and skin abrasions, respectively. their occurrence is likely associated with different management practices.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from european intensive care units: data from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection  (mystic) programme.
AB  == susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 european icus participating in the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme (1997-2000). the most commonly isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), escherichia coli (19.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). the incidence of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in turkish, russian and italian icus (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). the frequency of ampc-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. meropenem was more active against proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). against acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli and k. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from european icus actively using meropenem.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

AB  == we investigated transfer of antibiotic resistance from 51 multiply resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from seriously ill patients in the frankfurt university clinics. nine isolates directly transferred resistance to three recipient strains used. ticarcillin and cephalothin resistance determinants were accepted from eight isolates, and in one case a kanamycin resistance determinant was transferred. the total spectrum of resistance transferred demonstrated that several donor strains transferred a different set of resistance determinants to all three recipient strains. two p. aeruginosa isolates transferred spectrum of seven resistance determinants including ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam, three isolates transferred five determinants and four isolates transferred four resistance determinants. the fact that identical spectra of multiple drug resistance were transferred to recipient strains belonging to three different species (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and p.  aeruginosa), indicates a broad host range in all three transferable genetic elements not observed in previous transfers from p. aeruginosa strains.

TI  == mystic program: summary of european data from 1997 to 2000.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program  is a global study providing in-vitro surveillance data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. this paper summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and five comparator agents against 13,793 clinical isolates from 31 centers in 10 european countries, 1997-2000. meropenem and imipenem demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against the tested organisms, including beta-lactamase-producing strains that were co-resistant to quinolones and aminoglycosides. the carbapenems were active against the most frequently isolated pathogens including staphylococci (98-100% susceptible), pseudomonas aeruginosa (65-82% susceptible) and klebsiella pneumoniae (98-100% susceptible).  resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins was observed, particularly among enterobacter species in southern and eastern europe. eastern europe showed a high prevalence of ampc beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing  strains in russia (2000); 47% and 28% of enterobacteriaceae isolates were ampc or esbl-producers, respectively. there was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the four-year period. meropenem and imipenem appear to remain reliable options for the treatment of serious nosocomial infections.

AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == gram-negative bacterial toe web infection: a survey of 123 cases from the district of cagliari, italy.
AB  == background: foot intertrigo is mostly caused by dermatophytes and yeasts, less frequently by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. nevertheless, the importance of polymicrobial infections and especially colonizations of pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause therapy problems in relation to antibiotic resistance and the risk of potentially lethal complications. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the main epidemiologic and clinical features of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria, the function of promoting factors, and the measures taken to treat and prevent this disorder. methods: between 1989 and  1998, 123 cases of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria were observed at the cagliari university dermatology department. routine clinical and blood examinations, repeated bacterioscopic and mycologic examinations, cultures aimed  at identifying the responsible bacteria, and antibiograms were performed. results: p aeruginosa was found to be the prevailing pathogen, both alone and associated with other gram-negative bacteria (such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii) and gram-positive bacteria. clinical manifestations were similar in the majority of patients: erythema, vesicopustules, erosions, and marked maceration caused by abundant, malodorous exudate. lesions affected the interdigital spaces of both feet and frequently extended to the planta and the back of the toes. patients complained of burning and pain. successful therapies were achieved with combined topical and systemic treatment; to avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance, the choice of the active antibiotic was guided by antibiograms. conclusion: in all symptomatic toe  web infections, the presence of gram-negative germs, such as p aeruginosa, should be investigated to avoid the risk of treatment failures and more severe local or  systemic complications.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of  august 1999 to july 2000. then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 499 strains. the  breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and gram-negative  bacteria as 68.7%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. the increase of low-susceptible  strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. vcm showed a strong activity against mrsa preventing growth of all strains  with 1 microgram/ml. in addition, the activity of arbekacin (abk) was also strong with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa. however, mssa and mrsa showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (mic: 16 micrograms/ml and  32 micrograms/ml, respectively). carbapenems showed high activities against citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. quinolone resistant e. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. mepm and carumonam (crmn) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. on the other hand, one strain of k. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (ccl) and one strain of p. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  almost drugs were not so active. the mic90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.

TI  == epidemiology and frequency of resistance among pathogens causing urinary tract infections in 1,510 hospitalized patients: a report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america).
AB  == bacterial urinary tract infections (utis) are an important cause of septicemia resulting in high mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. periodic reviews of pathogen frequency and susceptibility patterns impact on appropriate antimicrobial usage, leading to more effective prescribing practices. as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (sentry, 1998), participants collected 50 consecutive uti pathogens from patients hospitalized in 31 medical centers (26 in the united states and five in canada) and forwarded subcultures to the coordinating center. thirty-four antimicrobial agents were tested including two investigational compounds (quinupristin/dalfopristin [q/d], gatifloxacin). the rank order of the 32 species identified during the study was: escherichia coli (46.9%) > enterococcus spp. (12.8%) > klebsiella spp. (11.0%) > pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%) > proteus mirabilis (5.0%) > coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 3.4%). this pathogen rank order did not change from 1997 to 1998, but resistance patterns changed. clonal spread of confirmed extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains was not observed, but co-resistance was elevated for aminoglycosides, tetracyclines,  sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones. p. aeruginosa was most susceptible to amikacin (97.3%) > piperacillin +/- tazobactam (92.0-95.6%) > cefepime = imipenem (91.2%) > ceftazidime (85.8%). fluoroquinolone resistance was greater in p. aeruginosa (24.8-39.8%) > p. mirabilis (5.3-13.3%) > enterobacter spp. (6.7-8.9%) > klebsiella spp. (4.2-7.8%) > e. coli (3.0-3.8%). only 5% of enterococci were resistant to vancomycin. these results emphasize the need for continued surveillance studies for common infections which establish baseline resistance patterns by geographic areas, and have the potential to detect epidemics or direct local epidemiologic interventions.

AB  == the in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) and pseudorabies virus (prv). the viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. the antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects prv and hsv-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells  were observed at the concentrations assayed. the therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for hsv-1 and prv, respectively. the antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil of m. verticillata was analyzed by gas  chromatography (gc) technique. of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. the antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define  the mechanisms of action are warranted.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in south trinidad.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was carried out at a general practice in south trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. methods: quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. results: from 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. the lowest incidence of urinary tract  infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. most males above 50  years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by proteus mirabilis, 9%, and klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. all urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. conclusion: the high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. the ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == the development of the bsac standardized method of disc diffusion testing.
AB  == the bsac working party on susceptibility testing has developed a standardized method of disc susceptibility testing that has been 'field tested' in 19 diagnostic laboratories in the uk and ireland. the method employs semi-defined media, a semi-confluent inoculum and relates zones of inhibition with bsac-specified mic breakpoints to interpret susceptibility. the bacteria selected for the trial included clinical isolates and control strains from the atcc and nctc national collections. organisms were chosen because they had known attributes, such as being fully susceptible or having a demonstrated mechanism of resistance. the results from this survey are very encouraging. with the commonly  isolated enterobacteriaceae, specifically escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp., no major problems were observed except with gentamicin and cefuroxime. in the case of gentamicin, problems were associated with resistant strains of p. mirabilis, with mics of 2 mg/l, being falsely reported as susceptible. for cefuroxime, it is not unexpected that results were unreliable, as the mic distribution straddles the in vitro breakpoint concentration (following the results of this study the mic and zone diameter breakpoints have been amended to improve reporting). no major problems were encountered for pseudomonas aeruginosa with the agents studied. the 'field survey' has shown that disc testing is unreliable for determining the susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci to teicoplanin, and that the detection of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is improved by incubation for a full 24 h. inconsistencies observed with fastidious organisms were associated with incorrect inocula. zone diameter data for the control strains studied provide information that can be utilized by diagnostic laboratories to monitor the daily performance  of testing.

AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == postantibiotic suppression effect of macrolides on the expression of flagellin in pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the phenomenon of postantibiotic effect (pae) encompasses not only the effects of bacterial growth inhibition but also the suppression of virulence factors. we tentatively designated the latter effect the postantibiotic suppression effect (pase). the flagella of gram-negative bacteria are involved in the development of biofilms. we measured the pase of erythromycin (ery) and azithromycin (azm) on the expression of flagellin in pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. flagellin preparations were subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate (sds) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) analysis and the flagellin band was identified by n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. we thus evaluated the flagellin by the intensity of the band. the mean durations of the pae of ery and  azm on bacterial growth were 0.9 and 2.0 h for p. mirabilis, and 0.6 and 2.7 h for p. aeruginosa, respectively. the pase of these drugs on flagellin expression  was also observed. the apparent pases of ery and azm on flagellin were up to 5 h  for p. mirabilis and up to 6 h for p. aeruginosa after a single 0.5 x minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) treatment for 5 h. our results suggest that certain combinations of antibiotics may have prolonged suppressive effects on the expression of virulence factors in certain gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  == utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  enterobacteriaceae. the results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the  members of these species. the genomic hybridization of selected enterobacteriaceae members with the escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to e. coli. however, the salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglr and bglg regions and the deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. similarly, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglr and bglg regions and deletions of the bglf and bglb genes. the homolog of the cel operon could be identified in s. sonnei and salmonella groups of organisms. possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.

TI  == the influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine t.
AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == a survey of gram-negative bacteria survival on hospital fabrics and plastics.
AB  == one critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person to person  or from the environment to a person (patient or health care worker) is the ability of the microbe to survive on an environmental surface. the purpose of this study was to determine the length of survival of various gram-negative bacteria on fabrics and plastics commonly used in hospitals. seven materials were tested: smooth cotton (clothing), cotton terry (towels), 60% cotton-40% polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), polyester (drapes), 75% nylon-25% spandex (pressure garments), polyvinyl (splash aprons), and polyurethane (keyboard covers). the following bacteria were tested: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter species, and enterobacter species. swatches of the materials were inoculated with defined amounts of bacteria and assayed at regular intervals. survival was dependent on the bacterium, its inoculum size, and the material tested. at 102 microorganisms per swatch, bacteria survived from less than 1 hour to 8 days. at 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per swatch, survival ranged from 2 hours to more than 60 days. these findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and conscientious contact control procedures in areas that serve immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with burn injuries.

TI  == influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  == the available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. in this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. bacterial counts  were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. a total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. an increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage  being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of s. aureus. the largest average growth increase was obtained with e. coli. the largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with s. marcescens. our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced  by humen wet cerumen. in vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  == background: ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (oe), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (aom-tt) and chronic suppurative otitis media (csom). the quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. methods: a survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of  quinolone otic products for oe, aom-tt and csom. results: oe: floxin otic and cortisporin tc otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. csom: ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter spp.  aom-tt: ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa conclusions: in each of the studies of oe, csom and aom-tt, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to cortisporin for children with oe; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with aom-tt who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients  with csom.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen  growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.

TI  == evaluation of a method using proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to experimentally induce dual infection of the urinary bladder in dogs.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a method using proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to experimentally induce dual infection of the urinary bladder in dogs. animals: 6 healthy mixed-breed dogs. procedure: dogs were anesthetized, and cystitis was induced by infusing a solution of salicylic acid in ethanol into the bladder, followed by an inoculum containing field isolates of p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa. dogs were examined daily for 21 days after induction of cystitis. on  day 21, dogs were euthanatized, and urinary bladder, renal pelvis, and prostate specimens were submitted for bacterial culture. results: after induction of cystitis, all dogs had evidence of thickening of the bladder wall, dysuria, tenesmus, and hematuria. urinalysis revealed proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria.  all urine samples obtained on day 21 yielded growth of p. mirabilis, but p. aeruginosa was not cultured from any of these samples. proteus mirabilis was isolated from bladder, renal pelvis, or prostate specimens from 4 dogs; p. aeruginosa was not isolated from any of the tissue specimens. conclusion: results suggest that the method used in the present study fails to induce dual infection  of the urinary bladder with p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa. the inability to establish a persistent dual infection with this method may have been a result of  insufficient pathogenicity of the pseudomonas isolate or an inadequacy of the experimental design.

AB  == the frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during the period of june 1998 to  may 1999. of the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with utis, vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) had strong activities. among e. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in  1997. vcm showed the highest activity against mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the mics of vcm for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. arbekacin (abk) was also active against mrsa with the mic90s of 2  micrograms/ml. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. particularly, meropenem (mepm) showed the highest activity with the mics of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. almost all the drugs except minocycline (mino) showed high activities against proteus mirabilis. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the mic90s of  16 micrograms/ml or above. mepm, ipm and gentamicin (gm) showed high activities against serratia marcescens. generally, it seemed that resistant strains of s. marcescens had decreased since 1996.

TI  == cefditoren activity against nearly 1000 non-fastidious bacterial isolates and the development of in vitro susceptibility test methods.
AB  == cefditoren (formerly me-1206) is an investigational, orally administered cephalosporin ester with bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and -negative organisms. cefditoren potency against nearly 1000 non-fastidious species was determined by national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. against staphylococci, usable cefditoren activity was completely correlated with  oxacillin with respect to potency and susceptibility interpretation (mec a-negative strains). cefditoren was very active against klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, salmonella spp., and escherichia coli (mic(90) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; median zone, 23-26 mm). cefditoren had more limited activity against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and indole-positive proteae (mic(50) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; mic(90), > 16 microg/ml; median zone, 18-25 mm). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., and other non-fermentors, cefditoren was inactive (mic(90), > 16 microg/ml; zone, 6 mm). pharmacokinetic analysis of cefditoren showed that utilized dosages produce a plasma concentration that exceeds 0.5 microg/ml for 5  to 8 h and 1 microg/ml for 4 to 6 hours (t(1/2) ranges from 1.5-2 h). the following interpretive criteria were suggested: </= 2 microg/ml or >/= 15 mm (susceptible) and >/= 8 microg/ml or </= 11 mm (resistance) that yielded an intermethod categorical agreement of 95.8% and very major or major error rates of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. alternatively, </= 1 microg/ml or >/= 18 mm (susceptible) and >/= 4 microg/ml or </= 14 mm (resistant) breakpoints resulted in 96.2% accuracy and combined serious errors of only 1.1%. cefditoren was observed to be a very active cephalosporin ranking among the most potent available orally active beta-lactams for use against a wide variety of pathogens.

TI  == respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  == although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. it has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (ccf) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (doc) subjects (pii 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). while no subjects in the doc group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the ccf subjects were found to be colonized. oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in ccf subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and higher plaque scores. these results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of copd may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the united states and the netherlands. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of ph on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. the mics of american and dutch isolates agreed  in general. the mics of the american gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the mics of the dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. a few european strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high mics. bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. the mics of the american gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the mics of dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to  2.0 microg/ ml. difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with escherichia coli, staphylococcus  intermedius, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. there  was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the ph of the medium increased the mic of proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. the mics of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral ph and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. at a neutral ph, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4  times the mic. similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. a klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin mic, but at neutral ph the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the mic for a bactericidal effect. after 24 hours of incubation at ph 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except staphylococcus intermedius.  against s. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.

TI  == [frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the careggi general hospital in the period july-december 1996].
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. methods: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 ufc/ml were examined in our laboratory from july through december 1996. inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. five different ward typologies were taken into account (surgery, medicine, obstetrics, spinal unit and high risk wards). isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. antibiotic susceptibility  was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. for strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. results: the results obtained show that  bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are escherichia coli  (45.7%), enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). those most frequently isolated among outpatients are escherichia coli (58.1%), enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). as far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned,  whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed  between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. conclusions: isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). this implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.

AB  == objective: oral antibiotic use may have changed the incidence and microbiology of otitic intracranial complications. we reviewed cases of acute mastoiditis to document: (1) incidence of intracranial complications; (2) risk factors; and (3)  identify pathologic organisms. methods: a retrospective study of children at a tertiary care children's hospital with acute mastoiditis from july, 1986 through  june, 1998. results: 118 children with acute mastoiditis were identified. eight patients (6.8%), ages 20 months to 14 years, had intracranial complications related to acute mastoiditis. three children had a sigmoid sinus thrombosis, two  children had an epidural abscess, and two children had both complications of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and epidural abscess, and a sigmoid sinus thrombosis and meningitis was present in one child. pre-admission oral antibiotics were administered for an average of 10 days in seven of the eight patients. persistent otorrhea and/or otalgia were present in all patients. intraoperative cultures were negative in four cases (50%). organisms isolated included: streptococcus pneumoniae (2); proteus mirabilis (1); pseudomonas aeruginosa (1); and coagulase  negative staphylococcus (1). multi-drug resistant organisms were documented in only one case. all patients underwent a contrast enhanced ct of the temporal bones and brain. surgical management included complete mastoidectomy in all patients and a pressure equalization tube in seven of the eight cases. conclusions: our review did not document an increase in the incidence of otitic intracranial complications. persistent otalgia or otorrhea while on oral antibiotics with associated neurologic symptoms are ominous signs suggestive of a complication. multi-drug resistant organisms are uncommon whereas negative intraoperative cultures are common.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, gar-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth  or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

AB  == the saccharide constituents of lipopolysaccharides (lps) of proteus spp. vary with the strain and contain unique components about which little is known. the biological activities of lps and lipid a from s- and r-forms of 10 proteus strains were examined. lps from all s-form proteus strains was lethal to d-(+)-galactosamine (galn)-loaded, lps-responsive, c3h/hen mice, but not to lps-hypo-responsive c3h/hej mice. p. vulgaris 025 lps evoked strong anaphylactoid reactions in n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp)-primed c3h/hej mice. lps from s- and r-form proteus strains induced production of nitric oxide (no) and tumour necrosis factor (tnf) by macrophages isolated from c3h/hen but not c3h/hej mice. lipid a from proteus strains also induced no and tnf production, although lipid a was less potent than lps. the effects of lps were mainly dependent on cd14; lps-induced no and tnf production in cd14+ j774.1 cells was significantly greater than in cd14-j7.def.3 cells. all lps from proteus strains,  and especially from p. vulgaris 025, exhibited higher anti-complementary activity than lps from escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa. polymyxin b inactivated proteus lps in a dose-dependent manner, but these lps preparations were more resistant to polymyxin b than e. coli lps. cap18(109-135), a granulocyte-derived  peptide, inhibited proteus lps endotoxicity only when the lps:cap18(109-135) ratio was appropriate, which suggests that cap18(109-135) acts through a different mechanism than polymyxin b. the results indicate that lps from proteus  spp. are potently endotoxic, but that the toxicity is different from that of lps  from e. coli or salmonella spp. and even varies among different proteus strains.  the variation in biological activities among proteus lps may be due to unique components within the respective lps.

TI  == interactions of "limax amoebae" and gram-negative bacteria: experimental studies  and review of current problems.
AB  == free-living amoebae can harbour bacteria inside their cysts giving them a microhabitat and protecting them from disinfectants. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential importance of "limax amoebae" as vectors for environmental and nosocomial bacteria in a hospital. it was shown that free-living amoebae are  ubiquitous in the investigated hospital, occur syntopically with facultative human pathogens (comamonas acidovorans and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and may serve  as hosts not only for these but also for bacteria isolated from clinical specimens (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa); temperature is apparently of crucial importance for the interactions between these microorganisms. recent studies have shown that "limax amoebae" apart from acting as protective hosts, may also play a role for the thermotolerance, invasiveness and antibiotic-resistance of bacteria. considering also the reduced  immune-status of many patients, this "symbiosis" of free-living amoebae and bacteria might still be of underestimated hospital-hygienic importance.

AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in north america: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program evaluates  international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. we describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from utis during the third-quarter of 1997 in north america (united states and canada), as part of this worldwide program. the isolates were  tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and automated ribotyping. the five most frequently isolated species were escherichia coli (48.6%), enterococcus spp. (13.7%), klebsiella spp. (12.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and enterobacter spp. or  proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). for each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. for gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against e. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the usa were vancomycin-resistant (88% with van a). p. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem  (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). e. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), k. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (amp c) stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). these data demonstrated that several uti isolates in  sentry hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == quorum-sensing cross talk: isolation and chemical characterization of cyclic dipeptides from pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == in cell-free pseudomonas aeruginosa culture supernatants, we identified two compounds capable of activating an n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) biosensor. mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy revealed that these compounds were not ahls but the diketopiperazines (dkps), cyclo(deltaala-l-val) and cyclo(l-pro-l-tyr) respectively. these compounds were also found in cell-free supernatants from proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter agglomerans [cyclo(deltaala-l-val) only]. although both dkps were absent from pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas alcaligenes, we isolated, from both pseudomonads, a third dkp, which was chemically characterized as cyclo(l-phe-l-pro). dose-response curves using a luxr-based ahl biosensor indicated that cyclo(deltaala-l-val), cyclo(l-pro-l-tyr) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro) activate the biosensor in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit at much higher concentrations than the natural activator n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone  (3-oxo-c6-hsl). competition studies showed that cyclo(deltaala-l-val), cyclo(l-pro-l-tyr) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro) antagonize the 3-oxo-c6-hsl-mediated induction of bioluminescence, suggesting that these dkps may compete for the same luxr-binding site. similarly, dkps were found to be capable of activating or antagonizing other luxr-based quorum-sensing systems, such as the n-butanoylhomoserine lactone-dependent swarming motility of serratia liquefaciens. although the physiological role of these dkps has yet to be established, their activity suggests the existence of cross talk among bacterial  signalling systems.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == in vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (hpmc) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of  the external eye. pure reference strain cultures of candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. serial twofold dilutions of 2% hpmc, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution  (0.85% nacl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. one hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. after 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. after 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. c. albicans and p. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. p. acnes and p. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. s. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. s. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. the viability of p. aeruginosa in hpmc dilutions needs  to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of hpmc may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. in general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. the initial introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an  important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. subsequently, the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and bacampicillin) were developed  because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum initially included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella, salmonella, listeria, haemophilus, and neisseria. the search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin and ticarcillin)  and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, and piperacillin). finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam) and an aminopenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra by inhibiting certain beta-lactamases (non-group 1) of resistant bacteria. the development of an ideal penicillin that  is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, and resistant to beta-lactamases and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.

AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by c. difficile. we have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their  biological activities against c. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including helicobacter pylori. here, we report on the activities of six  compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against c. difficile, and some of the compounds have mics of less than 1 microgram/ml. also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. c. difficile and h. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. killing curves for c. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by c. difficile. energy dispersive spectroscopy x-ray microanalysis of c. difficile  cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. internalized bismuth was not observed in c. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. the nature of the  carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like c. difficile.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the antibacterial effects of tumescent liposuction fluid.
AB  == tumescent liposuction is currently one of the most commonly performed aesthetic procedures. despite the variable use of preoperative antibiotics, infection is uncommon. prior works suggest that the low incidence of infection may be due to lidocaine's antibacterial properties. however, these properties have only been demonstrated using concentrations of lidocaine above 0.8%, significantly higher than those used in tumescent liposuction. the purpose of this study was to determine if the commonly used tumescent fluid containing 0.1% lidocaine, 1:1000,000 epinephrine, and 0.012 meq sodium bicarbonate possesses antibacterial  activity. using the broth microdilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus were determined after exposure to either lidocaine, epinephrine, bicarbonate, or the combination  of all three agents. to determine if there were significant growth differences not detectable by the broth microdilution method, bacterial concentrations were obtained through the use of a spectrophotometer, and significant differences from the controls were calculated by one-way analysis of variance. to determine if prolonged exposure to the tumescent mix would alter bacterial growth, a killing time study was also undertaken. the results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration of lidocaine was not less than 0.5% for any of the bacteria, whereas the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of the combined solution was  0.25%. the lowest inhibitory concentration as determined by spectrophotometric analysis for the combined solution was 0.13% (p < 0.01). analysis of the killing  time data revealed no inhibition of bacterial growth over time. in conclusion, lidocaine, epinephrine, and bicarbonate do exhibit antibacterial properties at high concentrations. however, the commonly used tumescent mixture containing dilute concentrations of these agents does not significantly inhibit the growth of commonly encountered bacteria.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

TI  == airways microbial flora in copd patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  == patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. the precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. in  the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. thus, we performed  fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (psb) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with copd, 16 with stable  clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. the aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with copd exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.ml-1). the predominant bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aerococcus viridans and chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). although significant  bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.

AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == microbiologic evaluation of cutaneous wounds in hospitalized dermatology patients.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to identify predictability of wound flora which may  be helpful in the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy of wound infections while awaiting the results of bacterial cultures. toward this end, results of an  ongoing microbiologic surveillance of skin wound flora in hospitalized dermatology patients are presented. bacterial isolates cultured from patients with skin wounds admitted to a tertiary care dermatology inpatient unit were evaluated and comparison was made to a previous survey of the same inpatient service done in 1992. microbiologic evaluation of superficial skin wounds, leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers showed that staphylococcus aureus was the principal isolate in superficial wounds (77%) compared to the equal prevalence of s. aureus (43%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (42%) cultured from leg ulcers. cultures from pressure ulcers grew proteus mirabilis as the dominant isolate. these data agree  with previous surveillance data from the same inpatient base performed in 1992 and support the relatively predictable wound flora cultured from skin wounds in our hospital inpatient unit over the 4 years surveillance period. this predictability can enhance empiric antibiotic selection for wound infections while awaiting the results of bacterial culture, and supports the value of local  microbiologic surveillance programs in the management of wound infections.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to  6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by  the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in  urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2  days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and  longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.

TI  == [therapeutic effect of cefluprenam on polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with enterococcus faecalis, using the infectious urolithiasis model in rats].
AB  == we examined the therapeutic effect of cefluprenam (cflp) on the polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with infectious stones as compared to that of  ceftazidime (caz), using the experimental polymicrobial urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis). in order to form bladder stones in rats, a sterile zinc ring was implanted as a foreign body, followed by  inoculating p. mirabilis e05106 transurethrelly. thereafter, p. aeruginosa e030033 and e. faecalis 966 were inoculated according to the same way. cflp or caz was administered intravenously twice a day for 5 days. the therapeutic effect was evaluated by the eradication of these bacteria from the urine, the kidney and stones, inhibition of growth of stones, and also a value of bun. the urinary excretion rates of cflp and caz was also determined (20 mg/kg). in result, cflp significantly more effective in the eradication of p. mirabilitis, p. aeruginosa  and e. faecalis from the urine, the kidney and stones than the control than the control (p < 0.05). furthermore, cflp significantly more effective in the eradication of p. aeruginosa from the urine and also e. facalis from the urine and stones (p < 0.05). meanwhile, caz significantly more effective in the eradication of p. mirabilis from the urine, the kidney and stones and also p. aeraginosa from the kidney and stones than the control. however, caz did not show eradicative effect on e. faecalis. the urinary excretion rates of cflp and caz at rats were 59.3% and 59.4%, respectively, within 8 hrs after administration, showing a similar excretion pattern. cflp exhibited the prominent therapeutic effect on polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with infectious stones caused by p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa and e. faecalls. on the basis of these results, it has been strongly suggested that cflp is highly beneficial in the management of intractable polymicrobial urinary tract infectious in clinic.

TI  == imipenem resistance in aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a prospective study was undertaken to observe the emergence of resistance to imipenem, if any, among aerobic gram-negative bacteria. a total of 736 isolates were tested during 1994-95 and less than 1% of them were resistant to imipenem, whereas the next year ('95-'96) the rate increased to 11 of the 903 isolates tested. the resistant isolates during '94-'95 were all stenotrophomonas maltophilia whereas the spectrum of resistant bacterial species increased in '95-'96 to include pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii with a tendency to an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in the later part of the year. a majority (72%) of the resistant isolates were from  patients with burns, and burn wounds were most frequently infected with such organisms. these data suggest that over a period of time aerobic gram-negative bacteria may develop resistance to imipenem and the pool of such bacteria increases with extensive use of the drug. non-fermentative aerobic bacteria tend  to develop resistance faster with widespread dissemination than enterobacteriaceae. hospital burn units are a potential source of development of  such resistance.

TI  == an in-vitro study of carbapenem-induced morphological changes and endotoxin release in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == one hundred clinical isolates, including escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and proteus mirabilis, were exposed to carbapenems (imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem) at 0.5 x mic for 3 h, then their morphology was examined and endotoxin  release determined. ceftazidime, which induces filament formation, was used as a  control. scanning electron microscopy showed that these carbapenems induced formation of spherical or ovoid cells, except for p. aeruginosa treated with meropenem and biapenem; these latter cells had a 'bulge' midway along them and we have termed them 'oval-centred'. there was a relationship between morphology and  the amount of endotoxin released following exposure to carbapenems or ceftazidime. of all the species investigated, p. aeruginosa showed the most variable morphological changes. p. aeruginosa exposed to biapenem were longer oval-centred in shape, and released significantly more endotoxin than those exposed to imipenem, panipenem (spherical) or meropenem (shorter oval-centred cells) (p=0.030, 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). in all strains except p. aeruginosa, carbapenems induced significantly less endotoxin release than ceftazidime (p < 0.05).

TI  == evaluation of use of a new chromogenic agar in detection of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == chromagar orientation, a new chromogenic medium, was evaluated for the detection  and differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms  in 900 urine samples from hospitalized patients. performance characteristics of the medium were evaluated in comparison to those of 5% sheep blood and macconkey  agars by direct inoculation of the urine samples on the three media. four gram-negative and two gram-positive strains as well as one yeast control strain from the american type culture collection were used to ensure quality control. chromagar orientation succeeded in detecting all the urine pathogens that were detected by the reference media, including gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci,  streptococci, and yeasts. colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation accurately differentiated escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. owing to the similarity in the pigmentation produced by klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter isolates, the  medium failed to distinguish among them; however, these isolates were easily recognized as coliforms because of their metallic blue coloration. staphylococci  were clearly perceptible: s. aureus and s. epidermidis grow in regular-size colonies that range from opaque white to yellowish, and s. saprophyticus produces opaque pink colonies. all streptococcus strains, including those from groups b and c, were detected. they grow as undifferentiated flat dry diffused colonies, and additional tests were required for identification. enterococci were easily discriminated by their strong turquoise pigmentation and their typical growth on  the agar's surface. yeast grow in typical creamy wet convex colonies. the accuracy of antibiotic susceptibility determinations according to standard methods was also tested by picking isolates directly from chromagar orientation.  the results showed excellent correlation with those obtained with microorganisms  picked from reference media. owing to the ease in differentiating mixed flora on  chromagar orientation, antimicrobic susceptibility tests were performed directly  from primary isolates in all cases without the need for subcultures.

TI  == [risk factors and pathogenic microorganisms in patients with insufficient esophagojejunostomy after gastrectomy].
AB  == it was the aim of the study to find by retrospective analysis of data from totally gastrectomized patients risk factors for the development of esophago-jejunal anastomotic leakage, that may be avoidable or influenced therapeutically. patients and methods: the study design was retrospective involving 838 patients with total gastrectomy for gastric cancer from the years 1973-1993. in 134 cases leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy occurred. the relative risk for the development of leakage associated with individual parameters was determined by comparing the data from 704 patients without leakage to the data from 134 patients presenting with this complication. for a subgroup of 86 patients with anastomotic leakage microbiological data of swabs taken from  the anastomoses were available, which were evaluated with respect to potentially  pathogenic bacilli. results: the overall leakage rate of esophago-jejunal anastomoses was 15.9% (n = 134). the mortality rate during this time period amounted to 14.3%. leakage was a most highly significant factor for mortality (p  = 0.0001). significant risk factors for leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy were  tumors of the cardia, splenectomy, a duration of operating time of more than 5 hours and manual suture technique compared to stapler anastomoses. tumor unrelated associated disease, tumor stage and a history of other preexisting gastric diseases were not associated with an increased relative risk. at the time of the initial clinical manifestation of leakage the following pathogenic bacilli could be isolated from leaking anastomoses with decreasing incidence: e. coli, s. aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae a.o. the bacterial spectrum has not changed during the observation period of 20 years. summary: with the exception of the choice of suture techniques the identified clinical risk factors cannot be avoided or influenced therapeutically due to a lack of potentially curative treatment alternatives. in contrast potentially pathogenic bacilli associated with leakage can be prevented from coming in contact with anastomoses thereby preventing infection and leakage.

TI  == effect of adherence on antimicrobial susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == a simple method was used for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of adherent bacteria to plastic surfaces. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis cells adhering to the bottom of a plastic tissue culture plate  were incubated in serially diluted antibiotic solutions. after 24-h incubation the solutions were removed and a fresh medium without antibiotics was added to each well. the viability of the cells was judged by their growth after a further  24-h incubation. in our assay system, we employed a short incubation time (1-h) involving adherence of bacteria to a surface for the purpose of minimizing the effect of the glycocalyx on antibiotic activity. even if the bacteria did not form a biofilm, the minimal bactericidal concentrations for adherent bacteria (mbcads) markedly elevated. the mbcads of ofloxacin well correlated with the bacteriological eradication by ofloxacin treatment for urinary tract infections (utis) associated with indwelling urinary catheters, whereas the minimal inhibitory concentrations did not show a correlation. kinetic studies showed that adherent pseudomonas aeruginosa had a 2 h-lag time before logarithmically growing when these bacteria were incubated in mueller-hinton broth without antibiotics. the tolerance demonstrated by adherent cells is likely to play a role in the difficulties encountered in the antimicrobial chemotherapy of biofilm infections. moreover, our assay system was considered to be useful in the therapeutic selection of antibiotics for these infections.

TI  == regulatory conservation and divergence of sigma32 homologs from gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  == the heat shock response in escherichia coli is mediated primarily by the rpoh gene, encoding sigma32, which is specifically required for transcription of heat  shock genes. a number of sigma32 homologs have recently been cloned from gram-negative bacteria that belong to the gamma or alpha subdivisions of the proteobacteria. we report here some of the regulatory features of several such homologs (rpoh) expressed in e. coli as well as in respective cognate bacteria. when expressed in an e. coli delta rpoh strain lacking its own sigma32, these homologs activated the transcription of heat shock genes (groe and dnak) from the start sites normally used in e. coli. the level of rpoh in serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was very low at 30 degrees c but was elevated markedly upon a shift to 42 degrees c, as found previously with e. coli. the increased rpoh levels upon heat shock resulted from both increased synthesis and  stabilization of the normally unstable rpoh protein. in contrast, the rpoh level  in proteus mirabilis was relatively high at 30 degrees c and increased less markedly upon heat shock, mostly by increased synthesis; this sigma32 homolog was already stable at 30 degrees c, and little further stabilization occurred upon the shift to 42 degrees c. the increased synthesis of rpoh homologs in all these  gamma proteobacteria was observed even in the presence of rifampin, suggesting that the induction occurred at the level of translation. thus, the basic regulatory strategy of the heat shock response by enhancing the rpoh level is well conserved in the gamma proteobacteria, but some divergence in the actual mechanisms used occurred during evolution.

TI  == bacteraemia in the elderly.
AB  == the aims of the study were to describe community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia in elderly patients and to determine the factors associated with increased mortality in these patients attending a tertiary hospital in singapore. a consecutive series of 191 patients aged more than 60 years of age admitted in 1995 was studied retrospectively. all of them had positive blood culture results  obtained from the department of pathology and the case notes were reviewed and entered into a standard clinical protocol. they were analysed for age, sex, place of origin, race, sites of infection, clinical parameters and bacteriology. the mean age of the study population was 75 years (sd = 8.9 years). bacteraemia was acquired from the community in 57.5% of patients, 33% was nosocomial in origin and 9.5% acquired it in chronic long term care facilities. the common organisms cultured in community-acquired infections were escherichia coli (26.1%), klebsiella species (25.4%), streptococcus species (11.1%), methicillin sensitive  staphylococcus aureus (7.6%) and proteus mirabilis (4.8%). the common organisms cultured in nosocomial infections were klebsiella species (19.8%), enterobacter species (14.6%), e. coli (11.8%), acinetobacter baumanii (9.2%), methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). whilst most cases of bacteraemia were single organism cultures, 13.5% were polymicrobial. the common sources of bacteraemia were chest (27.5%), urinary tract (24.5%), skin (12.5), hepatic (8.8%), gut (4.3%), cardiovascular system (1%) and others (3.6%). in 12.5% of cases, the sources were multiple and in 5.3% of cases, the source could not be identified. twenty-one per cent of patients with bacteraemia died. the following factors were associated with increased mortality rate: older age (median age of those that died was 78.5 years compared to survivors with a median age of 73 years, p = 0.011), patient's place  of origin (patients in nursing home at higher risk of death, p = 0.04), patient's mobility status (immobile patients at higher risk, p = 0.00297), source of bacteraemia--respiratory infection at increased risk of death (p = 0.00009) but urinary tract infection had a better survival rate (p = 0.03935) and multiple sites of infection (patients with multiple sites of infection had higher risk, p  = 0.00897). methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was associated with a mortality rate of 35.3%, followed by klebsiella species 28.6%,  pseudomonas aeruginosa 28.6%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 25%, proteus mirabilis 25% and e. coli 19.1%. important clinical parameters which indicated a poor clinical outcome were: high pulse rate, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, low total white cell count, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia and  increased creatinine level.

AB  == the results of bacteria isolated from the urine of inactive elderly patients with urinary incontinence in 1982, 87, 93 and 95 were compared and the chronological changes of urinary bacteria were analyzed. the following results were obtained: (1) the most common bacteria isolated from the patients in 1995 were d-group enterococcus, followed by providencia rettgeri, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. it is thought that the main cause of the more frequent isolation of enterococcus is an abuse of cephems and fecal contamination. (2) the most common bacteriaisolated from the patients who were managed with an indwelling urethral catheter were proteus and providencia species, and their incidence tended to decrease from 1982 to 1995. (3) infection with pseudomonas species tended to increase, as did that staphylococcus species, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and then decreased. based on these findings, it is important to assess and treat dysuria before inserting an indwelling urethral catheter, and to select an antibacterial agent that is effective in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and limited activity.

AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of  side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.

TI  == the role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. because of perceived limitations against streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the  treatment of chronic otitis media where p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic  bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. recently published guidelines in canada, usa and great britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring icu admission. a quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. for patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. in the absence of p. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.

AB  == in order to monitor changes in the frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens over several years, urinary cultures received from outpatient clinics and from a hospital during a period of one month each in 1991 and 1995 were analyzed at a clinical microbiology laboratory. in 1991 and 1995, 1366 and 1534 significant monomicrobic cultures respectively were reviewed. the frequency  of escherichia coli dropped significantly in the outpatient clinics from 70.5% to 61.2% (p < 0.0001). the frequency of proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria also decreased, but the frequency of klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. increased from 2.6% to 5.8% (p < 0.0001). in the hospital, the frequency of enterobacter spp. (p < 0.04), escherichia coli and morganella morganii declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas the  frequency of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), acinetobacter spp. (p < 0.05), klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative rods increased considerably. the frequency of gram-positive aerobic bacteria rose markedly in outpatient specimens from 6.1% to 13.5% (p < 0.0001), while a decline from 14.4%  to 9.3% was noted in hospital specimens (p < 0.02). a significant rise in the resistance of escherichia coli to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) was detected in outpatient isolates. in the hospital, gram-negative urinary pathogens demonstrated increased resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.042), cefuroxime (p = 0.005), gentamicin (p = 0.002) and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) during the study period. the changing etiology of urinary tract infections and the increasing resistance of organisms indicate that periodic monitoring and possibly also modification of empirical therapy are required.

TI  == isolation, purification, and characterization of the major autolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the major (26 kda) autolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative electrophoresis, ion-exchange, and dye-ligand chromatographies. this purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing peptidoglycan. the pl of the 26-kda autolysin was determined to be between 3.5 and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for activity. the autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli indicating it to be a beta-glycosidase. it was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from gram-positive bacteria and the o-acetylated peptidoglycans from either proteus mirabilis or staphylococcus aureus. the n-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be his-glu-pro-pro-gly. the 26-kda autolysin together with a 29-kda autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal growth, but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth supernatants.

AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == ofloxacin otic solution for treatment of otitis externa in children and adults.
AB  == objective: to compare the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution with those of cortisporin otic solutions (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin b sulfate, and hydrocortisone) in otitis externa in adults and children. design: two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults. setting: twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial. patients: a total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (ce), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (me). interventions: ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 ml; children, 0.25 ml) twice daily or cortisporin (adults, 0.2 ml; children, 0.15 ml) 4 times daily for 10 days. main outcome measures: the ce subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. the me subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. results: cure was observed in 82% and 97% of ce adults and children treated with  ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of ce adults and children treated with cortisporin, respectively. the most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were pseudomonas  aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. there were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups. conclusions: ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa. the bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children.

TI  == production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == multicenter laboratory evaluation of the biomerieux vitek antimicrobial susceptibility testing system with 11 antimicrobial agents versus members of the  family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a four-center study in which a total of 1,082 recent clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined versus  11 antimicrobial agents with the biomerieux vitek susceptibility test system (hazelwood, mo.) and the gns-f6 card was conducted. in addition, a challenge set  consisting of the same 200 organisms was examined in each of the four participating laboratories. results obtained with the vitek system were compared  to mics determined by a standardized broth microdilution method. for purposes of  comparison, susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) were assigned on the basis of the results of both methods. the result of the broth microdilution test was considered definitive. the total category error rate with the vitek system and the recent clinical isolates (11,902 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 4.5%, i.e., 1.7% very major errors, 0.9%  major errors, and 1.9% minor errors. the total category error rate calculated from tests performed with the challenge set (i.e., 8,800 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 5.9%, i.e., 2.2% very major errors, 1.1% major errors, and 2.6%  minor errors. very major error rates higher than the totals were noted with enterobacter cloacae versus ampicillin-sulbactam, aztreonam, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate and with p. aeruginosa versus mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. major error rates higher than the averages were observed with proteus mirabilis versus imipenem and with klebsiella pneumoniae versus ofloxacin. excellent overall interlaboratory reproducibility was observed  with the vitek system. the importance of inoculum size as a primary determinant in the accuracy of susceptibility test results with the vitek system was clearly  demonstrated in this study. specifically, when an inoculum density fourfold higher than that recommended by the manufacturer was used, high rates of false resistance results were obtained with cell wall-active antimicrobial agents versus both the enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media in adults. the french study group.
AB  == chronic suppurative otitis media is a common and potentially dangerous clinical condition that is difficult to treat because the most common infecting organisms  are often resistant to many antibiotics. recently, fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin have provided a new therapeutic possibility, offering a wide range  of antibacterial activity and proven concentration in the middle ear. therefore in the current study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of suppurative chronic otitis media in adults. one hundred sixty-four patients were enrolled during a 3-month period by 49 ear, nose, and throat physicians in general practice. the mean duration of symptoms was 158 months, with the acute exacerbation lasting 72.5 days. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were most commonly isolated. at the end of treatment, the otorrhea had disappeared in  104 of the 155 (67.1%) evaluated patients. the bacteriologic eradication rate was 64.5%. after 4 weeks of follow-up care, 93.2% of patients had no recurrence of infection. in 4 patients, treatment was discontinued prematurely after an adverse event. we conclude that ciprofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated general  practice treatment for suppurative chronic otitis media in adults.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  == the main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus saprophyticus and candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. the residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were  both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. these results support the ongoing  efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.

AB  == objective: evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. material and method: a total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at sao paulo hospital--unifesp/epm in june and july of 1992. the species distribution was as follows: enterobacter sp. (62), escherichia coli (308), klebsiella pneumoniae (27), klebsiella sp. (9), proteus mirabilis (23), pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), pseudomonas sp. (4), serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives  (7). susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. the antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, du 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, fk 037, imipenem, meropenem  and biapenem. results: du 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. it was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. the potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae,  except for enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than  they were to cefetazidime or fk 037. when testing pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active  than imipenem or biapenem. in addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. conclusion: the new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. however, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.

TI  == potential virulence factors of proteus bacilli.
AB  == the object of this review is the genus proteus, which contains bacteria considered now to belong to the opportunistic pathogens. widely distributed in nature (in soil, water, and sewage), proteus species play a significant ecological role. when present in the niches of higher macroorganisms, these species are able to evoke pathological events in different regions of the human body. the invaders (proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and p. penneri) have numerous factors including fimbriae, flagella, outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide, capsule antigen, urease, immunoglobulin a proteases, hemolysins, amino acid deaminases, and, finally, the most characteristic attribute of proteus, swarming growth, enabling them to colonize and survive in higher organisms. all these features and factors are described and commented on in detail. the questions important for future investigation of these facultatively pathogenic microorganisms are also discussed.

TI  == [urinary tract infections: risk factors and therapeutic trends].
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are very common in medical practice. women have a high prevalence of utis, approximately 50 times higher than men. a large proportion of this prevalence is probably caused by anatomic and physical factors chemical analysis of urine composition, examination of the urinary sediment and the bacterial colony counts are of great value for diagnosis and therapy. the patients may be benefit from antibiotic doses. in addition to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (tmp/smz), amoxicillin and cephalosporins, the authors observed a new drug: fluoroquinolones. these drugs derived by nalidixic acid and included: ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, pefloxacin and rufloxacin. they are sinergistic against most gram positives and negatives including pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. fluoroquinolone is an antibacterial agent that is effective in treating urinary tract infections. it is usually administered orally and is well absorbed after oral ingestion. quinolones are preferable to tmp/smz because of their greater antibacterial activity that occurred in about 82% of women. a dose of quinolones (400 mg daily for 3 days) has been particularly effective in the treatment of utis. the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can be used for treatment even if increased antibiotic resistance. the efficacy, relative safety and low cost of quinolones predispose to utilize its like the first treatment choice.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

AB  == objective: to investigate the ability of a silver-releasing device to protect the catheterized bladder from infection by blocking the ascending migration of bacteria from contaminated urine-drainage bags. materials and methods: a simple physical model of the catheterized bladder and drainage system was used with the  device located in the drainage-tube just below the sampling port. urine was supplied to the model at 1.0 ml/min and the drainage bag was contaminated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. over 10 days, urine from the bag, catheter sampling-port and bladder were examined for contamination. results: bacteriological analysis showed that the mean time for test organisms to reach the sampling ports of four different control bag systems  ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 days. urine from the sampling ports of the test systems incorporating the silver device remained sterile for 10 days. the device also prevented the growth of the large populations of bacteria (10(8) colony-forming units per ml) that occurred in the control bags. while scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of bacterial biofilm throughout the control drainage systems, no bacterial colonization was visible on the surfaces of the test systems. chemical analysis established that the devices consistently generated concentrations of silver in urine ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. conclusion: the incorporation of the silver-releasing device into  the drainage systems produced an antibacterial barrier which protected the catheterized bladder from intraluminal contamination for at least 10 days. these  in vitro tests suggest a useful role for the device in controlling infection in patients undergoing short-term indwelling bladder catheterization.

TI  == is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

AB  == although the vitek and microscan walkaway are two of the most commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems, few studies have been performed comparing discrepancies between these systems. in this study, 500 gram  negative clinical isolates were tested against ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam,  ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin to determine the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems. the 500 isolates consisted of 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus  mirabilis and enterobacter species. each isolate was tested simultaneously in both systems using the same standardized inoculum. eighty-four major discrepancies occurred, of which 48 were reproducible. the reproducible discrepancy rate, for the 4,500 isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested, was 48  of 4500 (1.06%). the rate for individual antimicrobics varied from 17 of 500 (3.4%) for ampicillin to no discrepancies for ticarcillin or ciprofloxacin. of the 48 reproducible discrepancies, 44 (92%) were vitek resistant, microscan susceptible. fifteen (31%) of the vitek and 21 (44%) of the microscan results were confirmed by broth microdilution. disk diffusion results were in agreement with 15 (31%) of the vitek and 21 (44%) of the microscan results. twelve (25%) of the broth microdilution and 12 (25%) of the disk diffusion results were intermediate. the broth microdilution and disk diffusion results for the 48 isolates with reproducible discrepancies were in agreement more often with microscan. however, there was less very major error comparing the vitek results for these isolates to the broth microdilution and disk diffusion. overall, the result of this evaluation indicate that the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems is minimal for the isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested.

TI  == indications and results of pleuropulmonary decortications in the university hospital of kinshasa.
AB  == in a retrospective and prospective study the authors assess factors influencing postoperative results in patients operated on for pachypleuritis with late referral to the hospital. there were 78 cases in the retrospective (1970-1984) and 28 cases in the prospective (1985-1992) parts of the study. the total number  of treated cases is 106 (75 males and 31 females). there were 32 children (> 15 years of age) and 74 adults (< or = 15 years). general condition was good in 45 patients (11 children and 34 adults) and poor in 61 patients (21 children and 40  adults). ninety percent of the patients were operated on at least one month after the appearance of their symptoms. eighty-one patients (75.4%) had an empyema secondary to bronchopulmonary infection (34 tuberculous). other etiologies were:  thoracic trauma: 23 cases (19 open and 4 internal); miscellaneous: 2 cases. the commonest isolated organisms were s. aureus, (21.4%), klebsiella (21.4%) pseudomonas (13%), proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa (11.9%), e. coli (8.4%) and pyocyaneus (5.9%). in all cases, a total decortication was performed.  good result was achieved in 55/106 (51.8%). there were 39/106 (36.9%) poor results and 12 operative deaths (11.3%). no correlation could be found between results and age, sex or etiology. a significant correlation appeared between duration of symptoms and postoperative results. the longer the delay; the worse the results.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

TI  == evaluation of chromagar orientation for differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and enterococcus species.
AB  == a new chromogenic plate medium, chromagar orientation, was evaluated for use in the differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and enterococcus species by a multipoint inoculation (replicator) technique. in this  study, 1,404 gram-negative bacilli and 74 enterococcal isolates were tested on chromagar orientation. six control american type culture collection strains were  also included with the testing to ensure quality control of the media. of the escherichia coli isolates (n = 588) tested, 99.3% produced a pink-to-red color. only in four isolates that were o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) negative did this result differ. proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris were well differentiated on this medium. p. mirabilis (n = 184) produced a clear colony with diffusible brown pigment around the periphery. by contrast, 15 of 16 p. vulgaris isolates produced bluish-green colonies with a slight brown background.  all aeromonas hydrophila isolates (n = 26) tested produced clear to pink colonies at 35 to 37 degrees c. this colony color changed to blue after 2 to 3 h of incubation at room temperature. a. hydrophila exhibited stronger color and better growth at 30 degrees c. serratia marcescens (n = 29) demonstrated an aqua blue color that deepened to a darker blue when exposed to room temperature. all enterococcal isolates (n = 74) resulted in a blue color and gave pinpoint colonies on purity subcultures at 35 to 37 degrees c after 18 h of incubation. similarity in color resulted in failure to discriminate accurately between klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter species. however, these species could be readily differentiated from other members of the family enterobacteriaceae. pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 151) was easily differentiated from members of the enterobacteriaceae but was less easily distinguishable from other gram-negative nonmembers of the enterobacteriaceae. the medium was found to facilitate easy visual detection of mixed bacterial isolates in culture. when used in a replicator system, it easily detected mixed growths of organisms which may have otherwise led to false antibiotic susceptibility results. these mixed growths were not obvious on the routine susceptibility testing medium (isosensitest).

TI  == douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  == a microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of douglas-fir (pseudotsuga  menziesii (mirb.) franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of fusarium, cylindrocarpon, and (or) pythium spp. in in vitro assays. a significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were streptomyces, streptoverticillium, bacillus, pseudomonas, or burkholderia species. the actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings  from nursery and forest sites. bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.

TI  == a human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with  acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection  from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20  bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing  loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with  the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the  rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact dapi-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  == as current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (sdfff) are attractive. in this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic  acids are used to identify bacterial cells. bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with sdfff if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant.  the effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in  a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the sdfff technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. moreover, they  have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaper-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamase.
AB  == plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of ambler class a are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. salmonella typhimurium jmc isolated in argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pmvp-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. the beta-lactamase per-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; cti-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pi of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. the blaper-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pbluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of per-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that per-2 is not closely related to tem or shv enzymes (25 to 26% homology). per-2 is most closely related to per-1 (86.4% homology), an ambler class a enzyme first detected in pseudomonas aeruginosa. an enzyme with an amino  acid sequence identical to that of per-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in turkey. our data indicate that per-2 and per-1 represent a new group of ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. per-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in south america, while the incidence of per-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family enterobacteriaceae and in p. aeruginosa.

AB  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis were investigated in 226 inpatients who sustained electrical burns over a period of 15 years. four patients who sustained thoracic and abdominal organ injuries were noted in this series. the patients had injuries of the small intestine, stomach, colon and the lung. all the patients received operative treatment. two of them died of sepsis. injuries to the internal organs should always be considered following high-voltage injuries, and they should be managed as early as possible. the data concerning wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries were evaluated in three  consecutive 5-year periods. over this period of 15 years, different antibiotic regimens were used for prophylaxis and treatment. most patients in the current series had been contaminated or infected by various pathogens prior to admission. long-lasting administration of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients showed  no improvement in controlling the sepsis. after 1987, most of the microorganisms  were eliminated following more effective antimicrobial therapy. the progressive decrease in infection frequency of species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae, appeared to be causally related to the changes in the general therapeutic protocol which included new antibiotics. the infections caused by e. coli and staphylococcus aureus showed a rather steady state. a marked increase in frequency of negative wound cultures was also noted between the years 1989 and 1993. a gradual decrease in mortality rates was observed from the first to the last 5-year period, whereas mortality rates due to sepsis showed a gradual but slower decline. sepsis (142 patients comprising 62.8  per cent of the total mortality rate) was the most frequent complication resulting in death.

TI  == bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  == in laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. the absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. the aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. in a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. in a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.

TI  == lung abscess in patients with aids.
AB  == we identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection and lung abscess. all patients had advanced hiv disease, and the mean cd4 cell count  was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). the microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). the pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), p. carinii (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (5), staphylococcus aureus (4), aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1), streptococcus milleri (1), proteus mirabilis (1), and cryptococcus neoformans (1). mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. the outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. in patients with aids, lung abscess is associated  with advanced hiv infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities and comparative pharmacokinetics of meropenem and imipenem-cilastatin.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (sbas) of imipenem and meropenem were investigated in a randomized crossover study. twelve healthy male  volunteers received a constant 30-min infusion of either 1 g of imipenem plus 1 g of cilastatin or 1 g of meropenem. the concentrations of the drugs in serum and urine were determined by bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were based on an open two-compartment model and a noncompartmental technique. at the end of infusion, the mean concentrations of imipenem and meropenem measured in serum were 61.2 +/- 9.8 and 51.6 +/- 6.5 mg/liter, respectively; urinary recoveries were 48.6% +/- 8.2% and 60.0% +/- 6.5% of the dose in 12 h, respectively; and the areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity were 96.1 +/- 14.4 and 70.5 +/- 10.3 mg.h/liter, respectively (p < or = 0.02). imipenem had a mean half-life of 66.7 +/- 10.4 min; that of meropenem was 64.4 +/- 6.9 min. the volumes of distribution at steady state of imipenem and meropenem were 15.3 +/- 3.3 and 18.6 +/- 3.0 liters/70 kg,  respectively, and the mean renal clearances per 1.73 m2 were 85.6 +/- 17.6 and 144.6 +/- 26.0 ml/min, respectively. both antibiotics were well tolerated in this single-dose administration study. the sbas were measured by the microdilution method of reller and stratton (l. b. reller and c. w. stratton, j. infect. dis. 136:196-204, 1977) against 40 clinically isolated strains. mean reciprocal bactericidal titers were measured 1 and 6 h after administration. after 1 and 6 h the median sbas for imipenem and meropenem, were 409 and 34.9 and 97.9 and 5.8, respectively, against staphylococcus aureus, 19.9 and 4.4 and 19.4 and 4.8, respectively, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 34.3 and 2.2 and 232 and 15.5, respectively, against enterobacter cloacae, and 13.4 and 2.25 and 90.7 and 7.9, respectively, against proteus mirabilis. both drugs had rather short biological elimination half-lives and a predominantly renal route of elimination. both carbapenems revealed high sbas against clinically important pathogens at 1 h; meropenem had a higher sba against e. cloacae and p. mirabilis, and the sba of imipenem against s. aureus was greater than the sba of meropenem.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == corneal ulcers in two institutions in singapore: analysis of causative factors, organisms and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the causative factors, organisms and antibiotic resistance in patients with bacterial keratitis in singapore. we analysed retrospectively 103 cases of bacterial keratitis admitted to the singapore general hospital or the singapore national eye centre during a 21-month period from march 1992 to december 1993. contact lens wear represented the largest single predisposing factor (35 eyes, 34.0%), followed by ocular trauma (28 eyes, 27.2%) and pre-existing ocular disease (28 eyes, 27.2%). thirteen of the twenty-eight cases of trauma-related keratitis were work-related injuries. gram-negative organisms formed the largest group (41 cultures, 80.4%), with pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common organism identified (30 eyes). pseudomonas was also responsible for 78.6% of all contact lens ulcers (11 out of  14 eyes). resistance to gentamicin was only encountered in 1 case of proteus mirabilis keratitis. all cases of pseudomonas infection and 3 of the 10 gram-positive cases were also resistant to chloramphenicol. all gram-positive cases were sensitive to cephalosporins. contact lens wear and ocular trauma are the major preventable risk factors for bacterial keratitis in young sighted eyes  in singapore. gentamicin continues to be the antibiotic of choice for gram-negative corneal infections in view of the low incidence of resistance. the  routine use of chloramphenicol as the topical antibiotic of choice for corneal infection is not recommended due to the high resistance in gram-positive and gram-negative organisms locally.

TI  == in-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  == driving while under the influence of alcohol (dui) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation  or suspension of driving privileges. the accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in  vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of dui. in this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees c for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, and candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (enterococcus sp., staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. the rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees c or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. many of these species were also able  to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by  fermentation.

TI  == the effect of iontophoresis on bacterial growth in urine.
AB  == purpose: to determine the effect of iontophoresis (electrical current for therapeutic purposes) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in human urine. materials and methods: pathogenic bacteria were isolated and inoculated into a dynamic in vitro artificial bladder model. pooled sterile human urine was regulated through the artificial bladder by intravenous tubing and pumps to simulate filling and emptying of the human bladder. the effect of electrical current on bacterial growth in the system was then studied. results: when iontophoresis is applied at low bacterial concentrations ( < 10(8) colony forming units [cfu]/l.), inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. however, when iontophoresis is applied after fulminant growth of bacteria ( > 10(8) cfu/l.), no inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. iontophoresis was not found to enhance the antibacterial action of gentamicin to resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusions: iontophoresis inhibits bacterial growth at low bacterial concentrations. it does not inhibit bacterial growth after infectious levels have been attained, and it does not potentiate the action of gentamicin on resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the detection of raised levels of igm to proteus mirabilis in sera from patients  with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == an analysis by elisa of 100 rheumatoid factor (rf)-positive sera selected at random from a collection of sera from patients with various auto-immune diseases  and joint pains, and 100 rf-negative sera from the same collection matched by patient age and gender, showed that the rf-positive sera had highly significantly (p < 0.0001) raised levels of igm antibody, but not igg antibody, to proteus mirabilis over those of the rf-negative sera. this response was subsequently found to be associated with sera from patients who clinically had rheumatoid arthritis (ra). sera from the ra patients had significantly greater amounts (p =  0.026) of igm antibody to p. mirabilis than to the other organisms tested and these values were also highly significantly different (p < 0.0001) from p. mirabilis igm antibody levels in matched rf-negative sera. sera from ra patients  also had significantly greater amounts of iga to p. mirabilis (p < 0.0001) and greater amounts of igm to escherichia coli (p < 0.0001) and klebsiella pneumoniae (p < 0.0001) than those in matched rf-negative sera. other classes of antibody to these organisms and all classes of antibody to pseudomonas aeruginosa were not raised in the sera of ra patients over those of rf-negative controls. the igm response in ra patients was not specific for only one o serotype of p. mirabilis  but was associated with all 11 different o serotypes of p. mirabilis tested and those of other proteus spp. moreover, the igm antibodies to proteus spp. appeared to be independent from c-reactive protein and rf.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == determination of muramic acid in organic dust by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  == a method is described for the quantitation of muramic acid, a marker of bacterial peptidoglycan, in organic dust. house dust samples were hydrolysed in hydrochloric acid and then extracted with hexane to remove hydrophobic compounds. the aqueous phase was evaporated, heated in a silylation reagent to form trimethylsilyl derivatives, and analysed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. the muramic acid derivative gave two peaks upon injection into the  gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer. injection of 10 pg of the derivative gave a signal-to-noise ratio of 17 for the dominating peak when using selected ion monitoring in the electron impact mode, and a linear calibration curve was achieved upon analysis of samples containing 5-1500 ng of muramic acid. in a house dust sample, 40 ng of muramic acid was found per mg of dust; the coefficient of variation was 8.2% (n = 6, 1.2 mg of dust analysed). the described method is rapid and simple to apply, and should therefore become widely used for  measuring peptidoglycan in many types of environmental samples, including organic dust.

TI  == imipenem resistance in clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis associated with alterations in penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == two strains of proteus mirabilis, ipr1 and ipr2, resistant to both imipenem and mecillinam, but susceptible to other beta-lactams were isolated from blood cultures of patients who had been treated with imipenem. strain ipr1 was isolated in the same sample as a p. mirabilis ips1 which was susceptible to imipenem and mecillinam. strains ipr1 and ipr2 did not produce a beta-lactamase and their outer membrane protein profiles were similar to those of ips1 and p. mirabilis atcc 29906. electrophoretic profiles of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) showed a decrease in pbp 1a of strains ipr1 and ipr2 compared with ips1 and atcc 29906.  competition experiments revealed a decrease in affinity of pbp 2 for imipenem from strain ipr1. these findings suggest that imipenem resistance in p. mirabilis might result from altered pbps, as reported for acinetobacter baumanii and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == inhibitory action of metabolites of pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == fifty clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella infantis, klebsiella  pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both e. coli and enterobacter  cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against  s. infantis, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. the pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. pyocyanin, the major metabolite of pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit escherichia coli, proteus spp. and other gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of  p. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. however, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of p. aeruginosa against  a large number of clinical isolates such as escherichia spp., klebsiella spp., and salmonella spp., up to now. for this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of  a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of e. coli, 30 of k. pneumoniae, 30 of s. infantis, 6 of enterobacter cloacae and 9 of proteus mirabilis.

(c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and proteus mirabilis(2). the specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. these were (a) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus albus(2), staphylococcus aureus(2) and micrococci(2); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1), bacillus subtilis(2), corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(3), proteus vulgaris(1) and proteus mirabilis(1). while these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and pb/mb types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out  subtypes if any.

TI  == comparison of the efficacy and safety of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == two hundred and three patients with skin and skin structure infections were treated with isepamicin once daily or amikacin twice daily in an open, randomised, comparative multicentre trial. patients were randomised to treatment  with isepamicin or amikacin in a 2:1 ratio. severe infections (63 patients) were  treated with isepamicin 15 mg/kg once daily (n = 15) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice  daily (n - 18), less severe infections (140 patients) with isepamicin 8 mg/kg once daily (n = 93) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n = 47). the overall clinical response rate at the end of treatment was excellent in all treatment groups (94-96% cured or improved) with no significant differences between isepamicin and amikacin in patients with either server or less severe infections. the most commonly isolated target pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. overall, in patients who had a valid target pathogen isolated prior to treatment and who met  other evaluability criteria, bacteriological eradication was achieved in over 90% of patients; amikacin patients with severe infections had a somewhat lower eradication rate (82%). over all infections, 4/110 (4%) patients in the isepamicin group and 5/54 (9%) patients in the amikacin had organisms which persisted. adverse events were reported in 12% of patients in the isepamicin group and 6% in the amikacin group. the most frequently reported adverse event in the isepamicin group as headache. two patients (one in each treatment group), both of whom experienced skin rashes, were withdrawn. potentially clinically significant changes in serum creatinine occurred in two patients, who received isepamicin and one who received amikacin (who was withdrawn from the study). ototoxicity was rare, occurring in one patient treated with isepamicin.

TI  == effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by escherichia coli and proteus, providencia, and pseudomonas spp.
AB  == osmotic stress, salicylate, and mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the ompf porin. since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of p and cfa fimbriae in escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in e. coli (c. li, c. j. louise, w. shi, and j. adler, j.  bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). in the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of e. coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. swarming did not occur at 20 mm sodium salicylate. salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in e. coli. phenotypic mar mutants of e. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when p. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mm salicylate. salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kda porin protein in p. mirabilis. this finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the  proteus porin may not be analogous to ompf in e. coli. salicylate decreased the motility of pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

AB  == two commercially available media recommended for the isolation and rapid identification of escherichia coli from urinary tract infections were supplemented with l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan. the non-selective medium proved suitable for the direct detection of lactose fermentation, beta-glucuronidase and phenylalanine deaminase activities, indole production and  the oxidase test. it was highly efficient in making a presumptive identification  at species level of the most common gram-negative urinary pathogens, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, that account for c. 85% of all urinary isolates. among the gram-positive isolates, most colonies were non-fluorescent and could be separated into staphylococci and enterococci on the  basis of the catalase test. fluorescent colonies were found to be staphylococcus  haemolyticus isolates, 61% of which were fluorescent. the selective medium proved suitable for the same biochemical tests, with the exception of indole, which was  not visible against the red colour of the medium. therefore, the differentiation  of p. mirabilis from other proteus-providencia species was impossible on this medium.

TI  == isolated fibrils rescue cohesion and development in the dsp mutant of myxococcus  xanthus.
AB  == extracellular fibrils are involved in cell cohesion and cell development in myxococcus xanthus. one group of social motility mutants, dsp, is unable to produce extracellular fibrils; these mutants also lose the abilities to cohere and to develop. extracellular fibrils isolated from vegetative wild-type cells and added to dsp cells fully restored the abilities of these cells to cohere and  to undergo normal morphological development. the fibrils thus mimic the ability of intact, wild-type cells to carry out the same rescue. optimal cohesion rescue  by fibrils required calcium and magnesium ions, did not require protein synthesis, but was energy dependent, i.e., sodium azide and sodium cyanide blocked rescue. cohesion rescue was also blocked by the diazo dye congo red. cohesion rescue is genus specific, i.e., isolated fibrils did not cause the cohesion of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, or the related myxobacterium stigmatella aurantiaca. developmental rescue of dsp by isolated fibrils included aggregation, fruiting body formation, and myxospore morphogenesis. developmental gene expression in the dsp mutant was only partially rescued by the isolated fibrils.

TI  == [experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  == the role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (uti) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological  factor in the development of bladder cancer. the bacterial strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with uti at the kyushu university hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mm) in a growth medium (ph 7.2) at 37 degrees c. of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microm no2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of e. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microm) could be detected. various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. the effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. the mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees c was assayed by the ames salmonella/microsome test (using ta100 or ta98 with s9-mix). the mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing s. marcescens or  p. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an xad-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 3 for 4 hrs. the potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. the mutagen formation at an optimal ph 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. it was noted that even at a physiological ph 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. the mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 6. mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. the levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable peptidoglycan autolysins of select  gram-negative pathogens by using renaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == for the first time, peptidoglycan autolysins from cellular fractions derived from sonicated cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli w7, klebsiella pneumoniae cwk2, and proteus mirabilis 19 were detected and partially  characterized by zymogram analysis. purified murein sacculi from p. aeruginosa pao1 were incorporated into a sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel at  a concentration of 0.05% (wt/vol) to serve as a substrate for the separated autolysins. at least 11 autolysin bands of various intensities with m(r)s ranging between 17,000 and 122,000 were detected in each of the homogenated cultures. some of the autolysins of the four bacteria had similar m(r)s. the zymogram analysis was used to show that a number of the autolysins from e. coli were inhibited by the heavy metals hg2+ and cu2+, at 1 and 10 mm, respectively, high ionic strengths, and reagents known to affect the packing of lipopolysaccharides. the activity of an autolysin with an m(r) of 65,000 was also impaired by penicillin g, whereas it was enhanced by gentamicin. a preliminary screen to determine the relationship between penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) and autolysins was carried out by using a dual assay in which radiolabelled penicillin v bands were visualized on an autolysin zymogram. radiolabelled bands  corresponding to pbps 3, 4, 5, and 6 from e. coli and p. aeruginosa; pbps 3, 4, and 6 from proteus mirabilis; and pbp 6 from k. pneumoniae degraded the murein sacculi in the gels and were presumed to have autolytic activity, although the possibility of two distinct enzymes, each with one of the activities, comigrating in the sds-polyacrylamide gels could not be excluded. some radiolabelled bands possessed an mr of <34,000 and coincided with similar low-mr autolysin bands.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of isepamicin (isp), mics of isp as well  as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many strains of gram-negative bacilli that were clinically isolated in 1993. 1. no isp-resistant  strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp. or proteus mirabilis. 2. isp-resistant strains were observed among isolates of citrobacter freundii, serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the frequency of resistant strains in each species, however, was lower for isp than other ags. 3. when mic90s were compared, antibacterial activities of isp determined in this study were quite similar to those determined during the drug's development period (1980's) in japan, suggesting no increase in the number of isp-resistant strains over the years. 4. the number of clinically isolated gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs are increasing in from year to  year japan. our results in this study suggest that antibacterial activities of isp may be potent enough against such gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs.

TI  == proteolytic activity and fatal gram-negative sepsis in burned mice: effect of exogenous proteinase inhibition.
AB  == circulating proteolytic activity (pa) increases following burn or surgical trauma. challenging traumatized mice with the yeast candida albicans further increases pa. once a pa threshold has been passed, mortality increases as pa increases. the purposes of this study were to determine (i) if gram-negative bacterial challenge affects circulating pa and mortality as candida challenge does and (ii) if proteinase inhibitor treatment with aprotinin, antithrombin iii, and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor decreases circulating pa and increases the survival of burned mice infected with a bacterium. for all bacteria tested (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae), burn plus challenge significantly elevated pa and mortality above levels in mice that were  only burned or only challenged. quantitative culture counts indicated that the mice died of sepsis. proteinase inhibitor treatment of mice burned and challenged with k. pneumoniae significantly decreased circulating pa, decreased the hepatic  microbial load, and increased survival. hence, in traumatized mice challenged with either c. albicans or gram-negative bacteria, a relationship exists between  proteolytic load and subsequent septic death. parallels between these animal studies and human studies are discussed.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical gram-positive  and gram-negative isolates. cefepime was active at low concentrations (mic50 values < or = 0.06 mg/l and mic90 values < or = 0.12 mg/l) against non-cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.). for klebsiella pneumoniae, mics were between 0.016 and 16 mg/l; the highest mic values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. against enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing enterobacter cloacae, mics were < or = 0.5 mg/l, but mics against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. ticarcillin-sensitive strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/l, while cefepime mics were 8-64 mg/l for strains resistant to ticarcillin. the cefepime mic50 value for haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/l. against methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus, cefepime mics were 0.5-16 mg/l; mics against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/l). against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime mic values were 0.03-16 mg/l; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains  were 2-128 mg/l. streptococci (groups a, c and g) were sensitive to cefepime with mics ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/l (mic50, 0.03 mg/l; mic90, 0.25 mg/l). the activity of cefepime against group b streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with mic50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. most enterococci and all listeria monocytogenes strains had mics > or = 32 mg/l.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  == the genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-pcd [ec 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a pseudomonas putida (formerly p. aeruginosa) (atcc 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed  using known amino acid sequences. a 1.5-kb smai fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading  frames, designated pcah and pcag, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-pcd. the amino acid sequences deduced from pcahg matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-pcd in all except three positions. cloning  of pcahg into broad-host-range expression vector pkmy319 allowed high levels of expression in p. putida strains, as well as in proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahg promoter with salicylate. the recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from p. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-pcd. the physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. these studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to  be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of p. putida 3,4-pcd, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.

TI  == iontophoresis and chloride-containing compounds: parameters required for killing.
AB  == fungi, and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were susceptible to iontophoretic killing in simple media. iontophoresis did not depend on electrode  type but did require chloride-containing compounds in the medium. all organisms could be killed efficiently if chloride-containing compounds (for example sodium  chloride and calcium chloride) were present in physiological concentrations. effectiveness of iontophoretic killing could be reduced by nonphysiologically elevated concentrations of other substances (for example creatinine and albumin). the data suggest that iontophoresis should function well in urine, since chloride-containing compounds are present in adequate concentrations even if some naturally occurring compounds, such as creatinine or albumin, are elevated.

'worm-like' structures 25-30 cm in length were found either in the catheter, completely occluding the lumen, or in the drainage tube thereby blocking the valve of the drainage bag. electron microscopy showed that these structures were  composed of bacteria, while culture revealed them to be mixed communities of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. following treatment with ciprofloxacin, catheter drainage continued freely for a further period of 10 weeks.

TI  == the ureter in vitro: normal motility and response to urinary pathogens.
AB  == the effects of bacteria on in vitro ureteric contractility were studied, using a  model which allowed selective exposure of organisms to the ureteric mucosa and smooth muscle, respectively. a cannula attached to a pressure transducer was ligated into the proximal lumen of 2.5-cm segments of canine ureter. the distal ureter was ligated to form a closed pressure monitored system, and the segment suspended in a 20-ml organ bath containing krebs henseleit buffer at physiological ph and temperature. following onset of spontaneous activity, broths of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were added to either the buffer solution or ureteric lumen in doses of > 10(6) organisms/ml. experiments were repeated using heat-killed organisms, bacterial filtrates and e. coli endotoxin. ureteric contractility was stimulated  by organisms added to the buffer medium, but reversibly inhibited by bacteria placed in the ureteric lumen. heat-killed organisms, endotoxin and live filtrates had no effect on normal motility when exposed to either the ureteric mucosa or muscularis respectively. these findings reflect the conflicting changes in ureteric motility seen in vivo when bacteria are administered systemically or directly into the ureteric lumen.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

AB  == a sensitive and specific serological diagnostic test for helicobacter pylori infection has been developed and validated in 120 patients with dyspeptic symptoms undergoing endoscopy. this test is to use urease, a protein unique to h. pylori, as the basis for the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) that detects serum h. pylori urease antibodies. the elisa mean optical density (od) in h. pylori-positive group is higher than that in h. pylori-negative group (0.57 +/- 0.23 vs 0.24 +/- 0.15, p < 0.001), a cut-off 0.3 od yields a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93%. serum absorption test showed that escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolotica, pseudomonas aeruginosa cell lysate do not influence serum h. pylori urease antibody level, though they all have urease except e. coli. the result implied that h. pylori urease can be a good antigen to detect serum h. pylori antibody and it would be useful for epidemiological survey and routine diagnostic approach. nearly half of the blood donors showed positive result with h. pylori urease antibody. it is suggested that h. pylori infection is quite common in the asymptomatic population.

AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

AB  == a human intravenous igg preparation (anti-lps igg) rich in antibodies to different lipopolysaccharides (lps) and a normal human intravenous igg (nigg) were investigated for their ability to confer passive immunity. both preparations were given at the time of infection (prophylaxis) or during sepsis (therapy) to burned mice with lethal infection induced by various clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. when given at the time of infection both igg preparations (5 mg/mouse) inhibited lethality induced by some bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup g and b), but not others (serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis), indicating a protection by by strain-specific antibodies. however, no significant protection was seen when mice were treated during sepsis. the range of specific antibody titers to the whole live bacteria and heat-killed  (lps-preserved) bacteria in the nigg paralleled that of anti-lps igg; however, the magnitude of the antibody titers did not accurately reflect the protective capacity in vivo. thus, the exact specificity of the protective antibodies is still unknown. the protective effect of both igg preparations was dose-dependent; at low igg doses (0.5 mg/mouse) better protection was obtained with anti-lps igg, whilst at higher doses (> or = 1 mg/mouse) both preparations exhibited identical  effects. low doses of either igg preparation in combination with subtherapeutic doses of piperacillin significantly enhanced early survival (day 2 for nigg and day 2 + 3 for anti-lps igg) against p. aeruginosa, but the protective effect waned thereafter. we conclude that a strain-specific antibacterial effect in a compromised mouse infection model can be obtained by early passive immunization with human igg from large plasma pools. it is suggested that anti-lps igg or nigg may be of benefit in some cases of gram-negative sepsis when administered as prophylaxis together with proper antibiotic treatment.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: transcriptional regulation by urer.
AB  == proteus mirabilis urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, initiating the formation of urinary stones. the enzyme is critical for kidney colonization and the development of acute pyelonephritis. urease is induced by urea and is not controlled by the nitrogen regulatory system (ntr) or catabolite repression. purified whole-cell rna from induced and uninduced cultures of p. mirabilis and escherichia coli harboring cloned urease sequences was probed with a 4.2-kb bgli  fragment from within the urease operon. autoradiographs of slot blots demonstrated 4.2- and 5.8-fold increases, respectively, in urease-specific rna upon induction with urea. structural and accessory genes necessary for urease activity, ured, a, b, c, e, and f, were previously cloned and sequenced (b. d. jones and h. l. t. mobley, j. bacteriol. 171:6414-6422, 1989). a 1.2-kb ecorv-bamhi restriction fragment upstream of these sequences confers inducibility upon the operon in trans. nucleotide sequencing of this fragment revealed a single open reading frame of 882 nucleotides, designated urer, which is transcribed in the direction opposite that of the urease structural and accessory genes and encodes a 293-amino-acid polypeptide predicted to be 33,415 da in size. autoradiographs of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of [35s]methionine-labeled polypeptides obtained by in vitro transcription-translation of the pcr fragments carrying only urer yielded a single band with an apparent molecular size of 32 kda. fragments carrying an in-frame deletion within urer synthesized a truncated product. the predicted urer amino acid sequence contains a potential helix-turn-helix motif and an associated arac family signature and is similar to that predicted for a number of dna-binding proteins, including e. coli proteins that regulate acid phosphatase synthesis (appy), porin synthesis (envy), and rhamnose utilization (rhar). these  data suggest that urer governs the inducibility of p. mirabilis urease.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the royal london hospital.
AB  == beta-lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the microbiology laboratory of the royal london hospital. this survey, performed between january and april, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. the distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. this increase was balanced by a decreased proportion  of enterobacteria. amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, tem-1 (especially),  tem-2, shv-1 and oxa types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. their frequency in escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst proteus mirabilis isolates. an apparent decrease in their frequency amongst enterobacter cloacae isolates, from  48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of p. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. in the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of e. cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii, and in 2/170 p. aeruginosa isolates. these proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (p approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were  found in 11/70 klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced tem-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified shv-derived enzyme.

TI  == nonspecific reactions of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (tecra) for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods.
AB  == a staphylococcal enterotoxin visual immunoassay kit (tecra) has recently become commercially available. since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types a to e (sea to see) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. in this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of sea, seb, and sec in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar  to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of sea per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of seb per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of sec per ml. however, the tecra kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than staphylococcus aureus, such as enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. the substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees c, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel). the problem of false-positive results with the tecra kit could be resolved by heat treatment (2 min at 100 degrees c) or by cleanup procedures involving metal chelate affinity chromatography with copper chelate sepharose for 4 h before use  of the tecra kit.

TI  == urinary tract infection in acute spinal cord injury.
AB  == preservation of renal function and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients. method--the hospital courses of fifty such patients  admitted to our rehabilitation department from august 1989 to august 1990 were studied according to age, gender, spinal cord injury level, method of bladder drainage on admission and upon discharge, type of urinary tract infections and results of bladder management were documented. results--forty-five men and ten women were studied. mean age of males was forty and females, forty-two. the commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident followed by accidents at work place. fifty-three percent had cervical cord injuries, thirteen percent thoracolumbar and sixteen percent lumbo sacral injuries. seventy-eight percent had an indwelling foley catheter upon admission. upon discharge eighty-two percent of spinal cord injury patients were able to void with/without tapping and compression. there were a total of one hundred and forty-three urinary tract infections in our study group. all positive urine cultures had greater than or equal to 100,000 cfu/ml. the commonest organisms causing urinary tract infection  were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus  mirabilis. conclusion--for bacteria to produce disease in the urinary tract, they must gain access and colonise the uroepithelium, induce inflammation and tissue damage. the indwelling catheter provides a direct access to the uroepithelium, making bacteriuria and subsequent infection inevitable. impaired voiding and sensation in spinal cord injury patients provides an excellent reservoir for the  multiplication of bacteria, tissue invasion and recurrent urinary tract infection. hence current methods of neurogenic bladder management have to focus on attaining a catheter-free status as soon as possible; relevant antibiotic therapy and careful attention to individual urinary tract problems to reduce morbidity and improve on spinal cord injury patient's future. although spinal cord injury patients are described, the material covered is applicable to any type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of amikacin (amk) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the amk disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the  disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of amk. included in the study were a 3 category system of nccls, a 4 category system used in japan, and the system proposed by the british  society for antimicrobial chemotherapy. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) cfu/ml. mic80 values of amk against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, enterobactor aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens  were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. the disc susceptibility test  was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disc manual. inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with mic values. the results of amk disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with mics, indicating that the disc method  was reliable in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.807 to -0.897, p less than 0.01 in both instances). in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, the break points in mic values of amk proposed are (+3)  mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. in the 3 category classification system of nccls, the mic break points proposed are defined sensitive (s) for mic less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (r) for mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. in this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == inhibition of motility of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis by subinhibitory concentrations of azithromycin.
AB  == exposure to subinhibitory concentrations (4-8 micrograms/ml) of azithromycin resulted in loss of motility in proteus mirabilis strains and a significant reduction of motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. examination revealed that the loss of motility was due to a total absence of flagella in proteus mirabilis while the poor motility observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa was due to absence of flagella in the majority of the population. since motility may be considered a pathogenicity trait in the two species, these results confirm the unusual ability of azithromycin to reduce the expression of virulence factors in  gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyra.
AB  == two plasmids containing the cloned escherichia coli wild-type gyra gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for dna gyrase a-mediated quinolone resistance. the results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of gram-negative species including e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the use of an arithmetical mic series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening  for the detection of altered gyrase a. the observations were consistent with the  suggestion that dna gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase a-mediated resistance can occur in all.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. in general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. the initial introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an  important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactam [corrected] ring. subsequently, the aminopenicillins (such as ampicillin and amoxicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella salmonella, listeria, haemophilus, and neisseria. the search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and temocillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and apalcillin). finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an aminopenicillin or ticarcillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra. the development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, resistant to beta-lactamase, and without inoculum effect and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten. results of a multicenter study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ceftibuten (cbt) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae, mic 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (i) naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: e. coli 0.12-0.5, shigella 0.06-0.12 and salmonella 0.03-0.12, p. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (ii) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: k. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and k. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (iii) chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 1-  greater than 128: s. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + proteus 0.06-0.12. activity of cbt was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, cbt was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. cbt was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 32) and  on a. baumannii (8- greater than 128). haemophilus and gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to cbt (mic 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for meningococci; b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin g) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin g). cbt was inactive on staphylococci. enterococci and streptococci b were generally resistant; streptococci a, c, g were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas mic for other streptococci 0.12 to 128 (mic 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). these antibacterial properties particularly against enterobacteriaceae placed cbt in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

TI  == activity of some antiseptics against urinary tract pathogens growing as biofilms  on silicone surfaces.
AB  == the activity of chlorhexidine, mandelic acid and a mandelic/lactic mixture were tested against biofilms of four species of gram-negative nosocomial organisms that commonly infect the catheterized urinary tract. cells growing on silicone discs were exposed to concentrations of agents used in bladder instillation. citrobacter diversus biofilms proved to be sensitive to all three agents. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae all survived  well in chlorhexidine but their viability was significantly reduced by the mandelic acid formulations. these results suggest that bladder instillations of mandelic acid or mandelic/lactic acids would be more effective than chlorhexidine in eliminating biofilms from catheter surfaces.

TI  == antibacterial properties of human amniotic membranes.
AB  == amniotic membranes are widely used in a multitude of surgical applications and have been shown to reduce bacterial counts and promote healing in infected wounds. antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid are well documented and the presence of many potentially antibacterial factors has been demonstrated. no such factors have yet been found in amniotic membranes. we have applied a direct disc-diffusion susceptibility test to try to establish the possible existence of  such a factor. amniotic membranes did not inhibit five bacterial species when tested at 3 x 10(6) and 3 x 10(8) colony forming units/ml. however, complete growth inhibition of all organisms was seen immediately under the amniotic membrane discs. these results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of amniotic membranes in vitro is due to their close adherence to the wound surface.

TI  == differentiation of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides and haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  == the mic of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. some of the more resistant strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. the model simulated, in mueller-hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. the first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. on re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. these occurred at a high frequency in p. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in k. pneumoniae (10(-3)). p. mirabilis (10(-5)), and e. coli (10(-6)). the number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. the results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: mic ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.

TI  == effect of staphylococcus epidermidis on adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis to polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) and gentamicin-containing pmma.
AB  == the goals of this study were to determine 1) effect of staphylococcus epidermidis adherence and biofilm production on adherence of the opportunistic pathogens proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to polymethyl methacrylate (pmma); 2) if the biofilm killed by autoclaving altered adherence of other organisms; 3)  if adherence of s. epidermidis to gentamicin-containing pmma altered adherence of the opportunistic pathogens p. mirabilis and p. aeruginosa to gentamicin-containing pmma. results show that biofilms formed by s. epidermidis,  whether alive or dead, significantly increased adherence of pseudomonas. adherence of proteus was significantly increased on dead biofilms and increased,  but not significantly (p = less than 0.1), on live ones. greatest adherence seen  in the study was to autoclaved biofilms. significant adherence of proteus and pseudomonas was found on gentamicin-containing pmma specimens, which were preincubated with s. epidermidis for formation on the biofilm. these results indicate that a biofilm is formed on pmma-gentamicin specimens and this may impair the ability of gentamicin to kill other organisms.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of gr69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility response of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to a set of antibiotics was investigated in a survey comprising 19,380 positive cultures over a period of 5 years in a large hospital environment. four out of the five species (p. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. the species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. through this analysis  it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. the longest period of oscillation was detected for s. aureus (38 months). k. pneumoniae and e. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and p. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.

AB  == uropathogenic adhesion was measured using a range of polymer materials with differing surface tension properties. experiments were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (controls), tamm horsfall protein (thp), and human urine with quantitation by image analysis. the results showed that thp  did not bind to the polymer materials and therefore did not act as a receptor surface for type 1 fimbriated escherichia coli. however, the thp did interfere with adhesion by binding directly to these organisms as well as to pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and, to a lesser extent, proteus mirabilis. incubation of the uropathogens in thp and urine resulted in altered adhesion profiles to polymer surfaces, with no single trend apparent. the results emphasize that fluid components, particularly proteins, and substratum surface tension influence bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (gm), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (ags) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical  isolates obtained during a period of july-december 1989. 1. gm-resistant strains  were noted in 24% of staphylococcus aureus, 12% of enterobacter spp., 24% of serratia marcescens, 7% of morganella morganii and 26% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no gm-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. 2. a majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and a large number of gm-resistant strains of enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. gm showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of s. marcescens, m. morganii and p. aeruginosa. 3.  among all the isolates tested of s. marcescens, 24% were gm-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (tob)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (dkb)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (amk)-resistant, hence the incidence of gm-resistant strains was the lowest. this tendency was also observed with p. vulgaris. however, among p. aeruginosa, 26% were gm-resistant, 14% tob-resistant, 18% dkb-resistant and 22% amk-resistant, thus the incidence rate for gm-resistance was somewhat higher. these results suggest that different ags-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. comparing the ratio of  gm-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio  increased among s. aureus, while decreases were observed among enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in gm-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.

AB  == representative isolates of nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied to investigate the hypothesis that mucinophilic and chemotactic properties in this species act as potential factors in the initial stages of pulmonary colonization  in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). transmission electron microscopy with a surfactant monolayer technique was used in a novel manner to demonstrate the adhesion of all 10 p. aeruginosa strains examined to porcine gastric mucin and tracheobronchial mucin from a patient with cf. control experiments showed that escherichia coli k-12 and single representatives of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella aerogenes did not bind to these mucins. the adler capillary technique, used to measure bacterial chemotactic response, showed that purified cf mucin acted as a chemoattractant for most p. aeruginosa strains, with the exception of  the nonmotile mutant m2fla- and the nonchemotactic mutant wr-5. the ability of the major sugar and amino acid components of mucin to act as chemoattractants was investigated. the degree of chemotaxis was strain specific; optimum chemotaxis was observed toward serine, alanine, glycine, proline, and threonine. no strain showed chemotaxis to n-acetylneuraminic acid, but all strains showed a strain-dependent chemotactic response to the sugars l-fucose, d-galactose, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. these results provide new information on the mucinophilic and chemotactic properties of nonmucoid p. aeruginosa and support the hypothesis that these properties could play a role in  the initial stages of pulmonary colonization in patients with cf.

AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil, a new oral cephalosporin, is the prodrug ester of cefpodoxime. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ru 51746 (sodium salt of  cefpodoxime: cpd) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1 696 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae, mic 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (1) naturally non betalactamase producing species: e. coli, shigella and salmonella 0.25-0.5; p. mirabilis 0.06-0.12. (ii) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: klebsiella 0.12-1. (iii) chromosomal cephalosporinase producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 2-greater than 128; s. marcescens 2-64; indole + proteus 0.25-64; p. stuartii 0.25-16. activity  of cpd was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains, but  cpd was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and on broad spectrum betalactamases producing strains. cpd was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 64) and on a. baumannii (16-pi 128). haemophilus, regardless on betalactamase production status, were very susceptible to cpd (mic  less than or equal to 0.25) and b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.12 to 1. cpd was poorly active on methicillin susceptible staphylococci (mic 50 and 90%: 2-4) and inactive on methicillin resistant strains. enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were generally resistant; streptococci a, b, c, g and pneumococci were inhibited by low concentration: 0.002 to 0.25 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.016-0.032)  whereas mic for other streptococci were 0.004 to 32 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-4). these antibacterial properties placed cpd in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

AB  == a total of 188 strains representing 11 species of gram-negative bacteria were examined for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. highly purified human plasminogen was labeled with 125i, and its uptake by different bacterial strains was measured. all 14 strains of haemophilus influenzae and all 13 strains of branhamella catarrhalis tested were positive with respect to plasminogen uptake. also, eight species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae were tested, and of those, proteus mirabilis demonstrated the most substantial uptake, with 28 of 39 strains taking up more than 10% of the plasminogen. ten strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested, of which seven showed uptake values higher than 10%. with h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis strains, scatchard analysis indicated a two-phase receptor interaction, one more-avid receptor with  a kd of 6 to 8 nm and 2,000 to 2,500 sites per bacterium and a second receptor with a kd of 50 to 80 nm and 9,000 sites per bacterium. with pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, a single receptor interaction was detected with a kd of 60 nm and the number of sites was estimated as 8,000 per bacterium. scatchard analysis  with strains of p. mirabilis indicated binding of a less-specific nature. however, plasminogen uptake by this species could be reduced by 50% by the addition of 2 mm unlabeled plasminogen. this estimate of kd, as well as uptake studies with plasminogen fragments, suggests different properties of this receptor. with all receptor types, the addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex inhibited plasminogen uptake, which demonstrates that both forms of the molecule  react with the same receptors. plasminogen uptake could be eliminated by the addition of lysine or epsilon-aminocaproic acid, which suggests that the lysine-binding sites of the plasminogen molecule are involved in the receptor-ligand interaction.

TI  == [antibacterial action of some saturated and unsaturated long-chain carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters in vitro].
AB  == using the method of twofold serial dilution of substances in liquid nutrient medium with subsequent reseeding on solid nutrient medium a comparative study has been carried out of the antibacterial action in vitro of long chain saturated (c10-c18) and unsaturated (c11-c22) carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters against pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 koph, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus 101+ and proteus mirabilis 56. the compounds studied have an inhibitory effect upon the development of the microorganisms. the minimum inhibitory concentration ranges from 1.8 to 19.3 mumol/ml. there exists a linear correlation between the length of the carbon chain (the number of c atoms) of the compounds and the minimum inhibitory concentration in the following cases: esters of saturated acids (c16-c24) and unsaturated acids (c11-c22) against pseudomonas aeruginosa; unsaturated acids (c11-c22) against klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 koph; esters of unsaturated acids (c17-c28) against staphylococcus aureus 101+. this correlation  has not been found in all other compounds against escherichia coli atcc 25922 and proteus mirabilis 56.

TI  == intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in serious infections. a prospective, controlled clinical trial with third-party blinding.
AB  == oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections  due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). the severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. for ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). isolated pathogens included: escherichia coli (22/12), klebsiella sp. (five/four), pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), haemophilus influenzae (one/one), proteus mirabilis (two/zero), proteus vulgaris  (one/zero), salmonella sp. (zero/two), plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). the clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate,  two/one. the bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one.  mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. a mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). the results presented suggest  that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. an additional advantage seems to be  a lower rate of superinfections.

TI  == [bacteremia secondary to decubitus ulcer].
AB  == we have prospectively evaluated 16 episodes of bacteremia induced by decubitus ulcers. the most commonly isolated microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis. bacteremia was polymicrobial in 5 cases (31%). most ulcers were already present at the time  of admission, but bacteremia developed within the hospital in 13 patients. in 3 patients, ulcers did not show local features of infection. the initial antibiotic therapy was satisfactory in 13 cases. mortality rate directly associated with bacteremia was 18%, but the overall mortality rate was 62%. we did not identify data permitting a reliable prediction of the findings of blood culture; therefore, the initial empirical therapy should be active against staphylococcus  aureus, pseudomonas, enteric gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes including bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == [antibacterial effect of cefixime].
AB  == cefixime (cfm) is a new hemi-synthetic orally active cephalosporin which exhibits a particular affinity for pbps 3, 1a, 1bs. its penetration through the gram negative bacilli outer membrane is similar to that of third generation cephalosporins. the mics were assessed by the agar dilution method against 2,489  bacterial strains collected in 10 hospitals. against enterobacteriaceae, mics50 and 90 are respectively (mg/l): naturally non beta-lactamase-producing species: e. coli and shigella: 0.25-0.5, salmonella: 0.06 - 0.25, p. mirabilis: 0.008 - 0.0.32; chromosomal penicillinase producing species: klebsiella: 0.06 - 2; chromosomal cephalosporinase producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii: 1 - greater than 128, s. marcescens: 0.25 - 16, proteus indole: + 0.06 - 4, p. stuartii: 0.032 - 0.5. cfm activity is not altered in strains producing an acquired penicillinase. on the other hand, cfm appears to be inactive against cephalosporinase hyperproducing mutants and its activity is variably decreased against expanded spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. cfm is inactive against p. aeruginosa (mic50 and 90: 64 - 128) and against a. baumannii (16 - 128). haemophilus and gonococci, beta-lactamase producing or not, as well as meningococci, are highly susceptible to cfm (mic 0.008 - 0.12). b. catarrhalis is usually inhibited by 0.03 to 0.5. cfm is moderately active against meticillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic50 and 90: 1-64), and inactive against meticillin-resistant strains. enterococci are usually resistant, whereas streptococci and pneumococci are inhibited by low concentrations: 0.08 to 1. cfm  is a bactericidal antibiotic, as shown by mbc and killing curves determination. these antibacterial properties relate cfm to the third generation cephalosporins  and position the compound in an excellent place among the orally active cephalosporins.

AB  == the influence of immune antistaphylococcal, anti-proteus and anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa plasma and donor leukocyte mass on some humoral and cell-mediated immunity characteristics in patients with purulent and septic diseases has been studied. the study has shown that treatment with immune plasma leads to an increase in the amount of circulating t lymphocytes and in the concentration of iga, igm and igg, to the activation of phagocytosis and to an increase in the titers of the corresponding antimicrobial antibodies simultaneously with a decrease in the content of bacterial antigens in the blood serum. treatment with  donor leukocyte mass has also been found to lead to an increase in the concentration of t lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, to enhance the functional activity of phagocytizing neutrophils and to promote the normalization of the content of leukocytes in the peripheral blood. the use of these preparations as stimulating agents in the treatment of patients having purulent septic diseases and, simultaneously, low cell-mediated immunity characteristics is recommended.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  == meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. all antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination  with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. generalized infections in mice caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. immunocompromised mice infected with ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. those given a greater challenge of ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of e. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. infection with ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. lung infections caused by ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. these results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species.

AB  == a monoclonal antibody against the yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kda) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), was obtained by cell fusion. the crpa common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (igg1) thus obtained. the purified crpa showed a single band of 60 kda in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and reacted with rabbit antisera against y. enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei in western blot analysis. the monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kda peptide from y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such  as v. cholerae, e. coli, s. sonnei, salmonella enteritidis, serratia marcescens,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. the results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on  a crpa molecule.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == effect of circumcision status on periurethral bacterial flora during the first year of life.
AB  == to determine whether bacterial colonization is a factor in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, we compared the periurethral bacterial flora of uncircumcised versus circumcised boys during the first year of life. intraurethral and circumferential glans cultures were obtained from 25 circumcised and 25 uncircumcised infants at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months,  6 months, and 12 months of age. different children were used at each age (300 total). the types of bacteria and the total and specific colony counts were compared. the results of the glans cultures were similar to those from the urethra. uncircumcised boys had significantly higher total colony counts (p less  than 0.003) at all ages except 12 months. escherichia coli was present significantly more often (p less than 0.01) in the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. gram-negative uropathogenic organisms (klebsiella-enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultured more frequently (p less than 0.0005) from the urethras  of uncircumcised boys at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. the specific colony counts for e. coli and the other uropathogenic organisms were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) at all ages except 12 months. we conclude that during the first 6 months of life, the presence of a foreskin is associated with a greater quantity of periurethral bacteria and a greater likelihood for the presence of, as well as higher concentrations of, potentially uropathogenic organisms.

TI  == ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  == renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. to study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. the ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. the mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis.

AB  == reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose  of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study,  approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains  (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of apalcillin on aerobic bacteria and the regression curve].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of apalcillin (apl) were evaluated by agar dilution on 1,201 bacterial strains isolated simultaneously in four university hospitals; agar diffusion tests (disks apl: 75 micrograms) were performed on these strains to establish relationship between mic and zone diameters. for enterobacteriaceae naturally non beta-lactamase-producing (e. coli and p. mirabilis), mode mic was 0.5 microgram/ml; some acquired penicillinase-producing strains were only inhibited by concentrations greater than or equal to 16. chromosomal penicillinase producing klebsiella were inhibited by 2 to 8 micrograms/ml but apl was inactive on acquired penicillinase-producing strains. for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species (enterobacter, citrobacter, serratia, indole + proteus and providencia) two populations of strains were observed: one sensitive and the second resistant  to carboxypenicillins: on the first population, mode mic of apl was 1 to 4 micrograms/ml; on the second mic were generally greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml. p. aeruginosa strains sensitive to carboxypenicillins were inhibited by 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; this activity was diminished on strains resistant to these antibiotics (mic apl 8-32). mic of acinetobacter varied to 0.25 to greater than 128 with a majority of strains inhibited by 4 to 64 micrograms/ml. apl was active against non penicillinase producing staphylococci;  mode mic was 2 micrograms/ml for enterococci. correlation coefficient of regression curve was 0.87. for critical concentrations less than or equal to 8 and greater than 64 micrograms/ml, critical diameters could be greater than or equal to 19 and less than 12 mm.

AB  == antibacterial activity of gentamicin (gm), along with activities of other aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, was studied against clinical isolates collected from pediatric patients during a period of may 1986-april 1987. 1. gm-resistance  was noted in 22% of staphylococcus aureus, 6% of proteus vulgaris, 8% of morganella morganii, 40% of providencia spp., 6% of enterobacter spp., 14% of serratia marcescens, and 14% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. no gm-resistance was observed with isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. 2. the antibacterial activity of gm against clinical isolates from pediatric patients was found to be comparable to its activity against clinical isolates from adults studied at the same time. 3. the majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were mcrsa, and the gm-resistant strains of s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa were found also to be resistant to multiple drugs. 4. gm-resistant strains were found at relatively high rates (14-22%) in s. aureus, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. these rates did not increase compared to the rates observed in the first half of the 1980's. 5. gm was considered to have poor antibacterial activity against genus providencia. it is concluded from above results that gm still maintains effective antibacterial activity against many of  causative organisms of infections in both adults and children.

TI  == a survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == interactions between antibacterial agents of the quinolone group and nitrofurantoin.
AB  == plate diffusion tests showed that nitrofurantoin antagonized the activity of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against many gram-negative bacilli, including all proteus mirabilis and klebsiella aerogenes strains tested. no interaction was exhibited when nitrofurantoin and the newer quinolones were tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci or streptococci. antagonism was not reliably demonstrated in chessboard titrations,  especially with the newer quinolones. continuous turbidimetric monitoring revealed that antagonism in pr. mirabilis was associated with abolition of the bacteriolytic response to quinolones and parallel viable counts established that  the bactericidal effect of quinolones was suppressed. apparent potentiation of the effect of nitrofurantoin by nalidixic acid and other quinolones against pr. mirabilis appeared to be caused by inhibition of swarming into the nitrofurantoin inhibition zone.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. it  inhibits the majority, 90%, of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes,  branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it inhibits 90% of the other members of the  enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii, cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, listeria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. in general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. comparison with other new cephems].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of  cpz, cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx) and latamoxef (lmox). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of sbt and cpz mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by  the dilution method using mueller-hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of cpz. antimicrobial activities of sbt/cpz against principally penicillinase (pcase) producing bacteria, i.e., s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, were superior to those of cpz alone. the presence of sbt in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced cpz's antimicrobial activities against these pcase producing strains. the synergistic antimicrobial effects of sbt in combination with cpz were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (cepase) producing bacteria, i.e., c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, and p. aeruginosa, and exerted with sbt at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by mic80's of tested agents showed that sbt/cpz had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria than ctm, ctx and lmox. mic's of sbt/cpz were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of s. aureus, 18% of c. freundii, 10% of enterobacter spp., 26% of s. marcescens, 2% of p. vulgaris, and 18% of p. aeruginosa. these resistant strains against which the addition of sbt showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. it is concluded that the presence of cpz resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from cpz is increasing. when these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of sbt/cpz in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics is ever expanding and remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. these medications generally have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity,  and efficacy against infections due to susceptible organisms. the clinical introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence  of penicillinase-producing staphylococci prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, and others), in which the acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase  ring. the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and others) were later developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella, salmonella, listeria, and haemophilus. the search for a penicillin with even further antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins, ureidopenicillins, and piperazine penicillins. recently, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an amino-penicillin or ticarcillin has resulted in further extension of their antibacterial spectra. the development of  an ideal penicillin that is nonsensitizing, bioavailable, beta-lactamase-resistant, rapidly bactericidal, nontoxic, and inexpensive and that has high affinity to penicillin-binding proteins and no inoculum effect remains the goal.

TI  == the resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  == isolates of providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. all species survived the antiseptic. organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. the effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. we conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate  established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

TI  == use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. the 31 males and  23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15),  abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), acinetobacter species (10 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), escherichia coli (two isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), kingella kingae (one isolate), bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). minimal inhibitory concentrations of  ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. in 39 patients, the isolated  microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. in 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. the duration of  parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). a successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients  (3.7 percent). side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion  (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.

TI  == clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy for gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
AB  == the efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin, an orally administered fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in 24 infections in 23 patients with osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and the results of bone biopsy and culture of bone or deep soft tissue. the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), serratia marcescens (five isolates), escherichia coli (three isolates), enterobacter species (three isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 1.56 micrograms/ml or less for all but one isolate. nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the mbcs in 20 of 24 patients. twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. a sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks  of therapy with a newly resistant s. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive p. aeruginosa strain. toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three  patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. overall, ciprofloxacin is a promising agent for the oral treatment of gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.

AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [urinary tract infections in children. status in a pediatric hospital and sensitivity of bacterial strains to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid combination].
AB  == three hundred bacterial strains from positive urine cultures were isolated over a 10 months period in paediatric hospitalized and out-patients. in addition to commonly used antibiotics, each strain was tested for amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin, beecham) susceptibility. this antibiotic, which is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta lactamases, may be of interest in the treatment of urinary tract infections because of its pharmacokinetics and activity. the antibacterial  activity of amoxycillin and augmentin against enterobacteriaceae with special reference to escherichia coli was compared. the resistance phenotype of enterobacteriaceae to amoxycillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin allows to anticipate the nature of the beta-lactamase produced by a particular strain, and  infer the activity of augmentin. the overall activity of augmentin should be interpreted taking into account the resistance phenotypes. in our study, augmentin was active against 90% of e. coli strains, almost all proteus mirabilis and vulgaris strains but 9 out of 24 klebsiella strains were resistant. augmentin had no activity against nosocomial enterobacteriaceae, nor against pseudomonas aeruginosa. on the other hand, its activity was of interest against penicillinase producing staphylococcus. our results confirm the interest of augmentin as a preferential treatment of urinary tract infections in children.

TI  == worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in japan, the united states, canada, france, austria, and hungary. standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. the susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for proteus mirabilis. susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.

TI  == lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  == in a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, strep. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, hemophilus influenzae, and proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. all clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. the gram-positive  isolates bound concanavalin a, while the gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. streptococcal species isolates reacted with dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. lectins may be useful  in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance at a hospital environment. observations from 1980 to 1986].
AB  == a total of 1659 bacteria strains were examined for susceptibility to different drugs by the kirby-bauer method. the isolates came from the general medicine ward of castellamonte's hospital (ussl 40). the results were retrospectively studied and statistically elaborated. the study lasted from 2 to 7 years depending on the antibiotic considered. the isolates included: escherichia coli, klebsiella spp.,  serratia spp., citrobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus ind+, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus faecalis. penicillines, cefalosporines, aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetraciclines, nitrofurantoin, macrolides, rifampins, lincosides and  peptide antibiotics were tested. the results of this study can be useful for the  choice of the antibiotics in non-specific therapy of infectious diseases and show the frequency of isolation of resistant strains from hospitalized patients. furthermore it would be important to constitute a regional-epidemiological centre of infectious diseases.

TI  == efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  == 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. they were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), haemophilus influenzae (16), proteus mirabilis (6), escherichia coli (6), enterobacter cloacae (6), providencia stuartii (2), serratia marcescens (2), citrobacter diversus (1), salmonella enteritidis (1), acinetobacter anitratus (1), staphylococcus aureus (1) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1). in 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. mics of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/l. clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. bacteriologically, pathogens were  eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).

TI  == reactions of hemocytes of immune and non-immune galleria mellonella larvae to proteus mirabilis.
AB  == immune larval galleria mellonella removed live proteus mirabilis from the hemolymph less effectively than did non-immune larvae. this was attributed to a decline in total hemocyte counts, levels of plasmatocytes and granulocytes and hemocyte adhesion capacity. immune serum possessed factors which reduced bacterial adhesion to the hemocytes. this was not due to altering bacterial surfaces but rather to irreversible suppression of hemocyte activity.

TI  == imipenem as monotherapy in the treatment of intensive care patients with severe infections.
AB  == in an open study, 24 intensive care patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin as monotherapy for serious bacterial infections. twenty-one patients were treated for bronchopulmonary infection, two patients for septicaemia, and one patient for an empyema. initially all strains were susceptible to imipenem. gram-negative bacilli accounted for 80% of these isolates. the most frequently isolated species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all 24 patients were considered clinically cured. sixteen of these patients (67%) were both clinically and microbiologically cured. in eight of the 24 patients (33%), the strains isolated  initially persisted. in eight of the 24 patients (33%), colonization of the respiratory tract developed. two of the five ps. aeruginosa isolates developed resistance during therapy but in none of these patients was therapy considered to have failed. in 12 patients (50%), transient elevations in hepatic function tests were observed and these were probably drug-related. the present study supports the view that imipenem/cilastatin may be useful as monotherapy in the treatment of severe infections in intensive care patients.

TI  == oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the columbia-presbyterian medical center, new york, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had  significant underlying disease. there were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. the pathogens were: escherichia coli, 7 (mean mic 0.07 mg/l); serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of acinetobacter anitratus. haemophilus, influenzae, salmonella enteritidis, flavobacterium meningosepticum, and streptococcus faecalis. of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70%  to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to  cotrimoxazole. ten patients had concomitant ps. aeruginosa infections. patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. the overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if  ps. aeruginosa is included. resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one staph. aureus and one ser. marcescens (mic greater than 2 mg/l). toxicity was minor. ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.

AB  == purification of a bactericidal protein (bp) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. the first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with matrex-gel orange a, was  followed by cation-exchange chromatography with bio-rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. only one peak of bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa type i was found after each chromatographic step.  characterization of bp showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of  55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified bp  was most active against the six strains of p. aeruginosa tested and against escherichia coli b (a deep rough mutant). purified bp killed 5 x 10(6) cfu of p.  aeruginosa type i per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. proteus mirabilis  and staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of bp. bp was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. the amino acid composition of bp is presented.

TI  == late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  == we described previously (w.m. shafer, l.e. martin, and j.k. spitznagel, infect. immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37k cap) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmn). in this investigation, we prepared 37k cap from pmn granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. at concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37k cap exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. these bacteria included acinetobacter lwoffii, escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei. however, at 5 micrograms of 37k cap per ml, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. the bactericidal activity of 37k cap was greatest in acidic (ph 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (ph 7.5) media. the level of s. typhimurium resistance to 37k cap correlated with the presence of o antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. in the absence of o antigen repeat units, resistance was  proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. these results suggest that 37k cap may contribute significantly to the ability of pmn to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides. effects of 45 months of amikacin as first-line aminoglycoside therapy.
AB  == amikacin was instituted as the primary empiric aminoglycoside at the san juan veterans administration medical center in january 1982; at that time, 16 percent  of the strains at the hospital were gentamicin-resistant. a prospective surveillance study was designed to correlate detection of bacterial resistance with aminoglycoside use. in the current report, the baseline period, during which gentamicin was the first-line aminoglycoside, accounting for 61 percent of overall aminoglycoside use, is compared with the period from january 1982 to september 1985, during which the first-line aminoglycoside was amikacin, accounting for 85 percent of overall use. this study is ongoing. during the two periods, the patient population did not differ with regard to aminoglycoside therapy, indications, or overall aminoglycoside use (541 versus 680 patient days  per month). among the gram-negative bacilli isolated, the percent of strains resistant to amikacin was as follows: pre-baseline period/baseline period, 0.8/0.2 percent; amikacin-usage period, 3.6 percent. resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin during the period of amikacin use decreased from 16 to 11 percent for  gentamicin and from 17 to 11 percent for tobramycin. the decrease in resistance of the gram-negative bacilli to gentamicin varied among strains: the resistance of escherichia coli decreased from 8 to 4 percent; that of proteus mirabilis, from 12 to 5 percent; that of indole-positive proteus, from 19 to 12 percent; that of acinetobacter, from 57 to 23 percent; that of citrobacter, from 15 to 7 percent; and that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 24 to 16 percent. during the amikacin-usage period, amikacin resistance was unchanged for most strains, with the exception of p. aeruginosa, the resistance of which increased from 4.5 to 7.8 percent. of the 4,795 strains isolated, 174 were resistant to amikacin; of these, 29 pseudomonas strains were studied for all mechanisms of resistance. changes in  permeability were exhibited by 11 of the 29 strains; 14 strains exhibited the aac(6')-i enzyme, 10 strains exhibited the aph(3')-ii enzyme, and two strains exhibited ant(2") in addition to some other unidentified mechanism. multiple enzyme production was found in 15 of the strains. the use of amikacin as a first-line aminoglycoside is associated with a decrease in resistance to other aminoglycosides and a slight increase in overall resistance to amikacin among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the usefulness of amikacin has not been affected at our institution.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == bacterial adherence to bladder uroepithelial cells in catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  == to assess the role of bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the pathogenesis of nosocomial urinary tract infection, we prospectively studied 55 patients with indwelling urinary catheters. we obtained uroepithelial cells from  the bladder and urine for culture on the patients' entry into the study and every two to four days during catheterization. in all, 235 collections of uroepithelial cells from these patients were used in an in vitro adherence assay with six gram-negative bacterial strains. with uroepithelial cells from patients who did not have bacterial infections, the adherence of the bacteria used in the assay differed significantly according to species. the least adherence occurred with escherichia coli gr12; the adherence increased with (in order) proteus mirabilis, e. coli j96, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. with cells collected just before the onset of bacteriuria, adherence  of these gram-negative strains was higher in patients in whom gram-negative rod infections developed than in those with gram-positive coccal infections (p = 0.005). analysis with the cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated that a significant increase in bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the bladder occurred two to four days before the onset of bacteriuria, but that adherence returned to base-line values with the onset of bacteriuria. these results suggest that a transient increase in the adherence of gram-negative bacteria to bladder epithelial cells may be an important early event in the development of catheter-associated bacteriuria.

TI  == characterization of pathogenic bacteria by automated headspace concentration-gas  chromatography.
AB  == automated headspace concentration-gas chromatography (ahc-gc) was used to profile the volatile metabolites produced by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. bacterial cultures were incubated in trypticase soy broth and examined at 24 h. the profiles were consistent for each genus examined and variation observed among the different strains of each species was chiefly quantitative. the volatiles were identified by concurrent headspace concentration-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and consisted mainly of isobutanol, isopentanol, isopentyl acetate, 1-undecene and methyl ketones. there were sufficient differences in the profiles in the 4-6 min  elution period to distinguish p. aeruginosa and s. aureus from each other and from the other two bacteria. p. mirabilis and k. pneumoniae typically showed three intense peaks which corresponded to isobutanol, isopentyl acetate and isopentanol. the determination of volatiles by ahc-gc is sensitive, rapid and offers a possible alternative for automatic detection and characterization of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic consequences of amikacin use during a 42-month period.
AB  == in june 1980, 23% of our pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and 53% of our serratia  species were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin. during a 3 1/2-year period of almost exclusive amikacin usage, we noted a fall in overall resistance of gram-negative organisms to tobramycin and gentamicin from 18.8% and 19.3% to 15.2% and 16.2%, respectively. this fall in resistance was most notable for escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and serratia species. during this period there was no increase in amikacin resistance. age, hospitalization, prior antibiotic therapy, and foley catheter use were predisposing factors in acquiring amikacin-resistant organisms. amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli were usually sensitive to newer penicillins or cephalosporins.

(1) unchanged medium: escherichia coli, shigella spp., yersinia spp., hafnia alvei and morganella morganii 100% each, klebsiella spp., 50%, enterobacter cloacae 37%, proteus vulgaris 59%, acinetobacter spp. 42%, pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: salmonella subgenera ii, iii and iv 98%, citrobacter freundii 65%, e. cloacae 55%, p. vulgaris 41%, proteus mirabilis 98%, providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative providencia 96%, acinetobacter spp. 58%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, p. fluorescens 81%, ufp (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads)  100%, other pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) unchanged slant, brown butt: s. typhi 88%,  salmonella subgenus i 3%, klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) rusty-brown slant, brown butt: salmonella subgenus i 75%, c. freundii 20%, klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. the localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in simmons' minimal and in kauffmann's peptone water medium.

TI  == providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  == the long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. published  accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that p. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. as in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has  commonly differed among institutions. in the future p. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. this trend appears  likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by p. stuartii.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == antibacterial activity of amifloxacin (win 49, 375), a new quinolone agent.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amifloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, aeromonas, salmonella, shigella, citrobacter, enterobacter species, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. amifloxacin inhibited branhamella, haemophilus, and neisseria at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, and 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin- and carbenicillin-resistant isolates, at 4 micrograms/ml. it also inhibited staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but was less active against streptococci and bacteroides species. amifloxacin had in vitro activity similar to enoxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin, but was less active than ciprofloxacin. like other quinolones, it was less active at acid ph and in the presence of urine.

TI  == [changes in the migration and adhesive activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes as 1 of the characteristics of gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with suppurative lung destruction].
AB  == the influence of gram-negative bacteria on the migratory and adhesive activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) in the peripheral blood of clinically normal  donors has been studied by the specially developed method with the use of boyden  chambers. pseudomonas and enterobacteria have been found to produce complex and various effects on the above-mentioned properties of pmnl. when incubated in fresh serum, gram-negative bacteria are capable of enhancing the migratory activity of pmnl, this property being least pronounced in p. aeruginosa. the incubation of live bacteria from the authors' collection in the patients' sera or in sera obtained from normal donors and inactivated by heating induces no hemotaxis of pmnl, and p. aeruginosa strains even suppress it under such conditions. the isolated gram-negative bacteria under study increase the number of highly adhesive pmnl in the population used in this investigation, but p. aeruginosa cultures do not produce such effect.

TI  == further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  == bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence  agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to  the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is  inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar  to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of  bacterial attachment.

TI  == comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin was carried out in 49 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. patients were randomly assigned to the treatment drug. clindamycin was given concomitantly until the pathogen was identified and the presence of a gram-positive microorganism was ruled out. samples of sputum were obtained for culture from the lung parenchyma by deep expectoration or transtracheal aspiration. a pathogen was defined as an organism that showed heavy growth and predominated in the culture. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis. a variety of less common pathogens were represented. thirty-five patients were treated with intravenous aztreonam (1-2 g every 8 hr) and 14 with intravenous tobramycin (3-5 mg/kg per day) until they were afebrile and sputum cultures had been free of the pathogen for 48 hr. the minimum duration of treatment was five days. in the aztreonam group, only two (5%) of the 37 gram-negative pathogens--one p. aeruginosa and one escherichia coli--persisted. in the tobramycin group, seven (50%) of the 14 pathogens persisted. clinical response paralleled microbiologic response. adverse effects in both treatment groups were  minor and transient. in this trial aztreonam was effective and safe for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by p. aeruginosa and a variety of other gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == aztreonam in the treatment of bone and joint infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == aztreonam was used successfully in 17 of 17 patients with orthopedic infections due to gram-negative bacilli (11, osteomyelitis; six, septic arthritis). duration of treatment ranged from 14 to 55 days, and the period of follow-up was four to 18 months. causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter gergoviae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, and  enterobacter aerogenes. aztreonam was well tolerated. the only definite reactions attributable to aztreonam were asymptomatic increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (sgot) and serum alanine aminotransferase (sgpt) in four patients; none of these reactions interfered with completion of therapy. adverse  reactions that were possibly attributable to aztreonam included rash (two patients), diarrhea (one patient), and leukopenia (one patient). all of these patients were receiving antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms in mixed infections in addition to aztreonam. aztreonam is a promising new monobactam without significant toxicity. it has good activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, and is effective in the  treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative aerobes.

TI  == clinical pharmacokinetics of amikacin in dogs.
AB  == after iv, im, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. the pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount  excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- sd, n = 4). within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. for isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin,  tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. for dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (im or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of antibiotics against causative pathogens  isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (uti) in the 8 institutions  in japan during the period from 1980 to 1983 were compared. a number of new beta-lactam antibiotics with broad spectrum of activity have become available for clinical use in recent years. some of them, in particular so-called third generation cephems, are reported to be responsible for developing microbial-cross resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. we have been making survey in recent years to explore changes in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents of clinical isolates. all bacterial isolates from clinical specimens were submitted to the department of clinical pathology, juntendo university school of  medicine, where they were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with mic 2000 apparatus. of all pathogens from patients with simple uti, the majority of the isolates was e. coli and klebsiella spp. in cases of complicated uti, on the other hand, pseudomonas spp. were most frequent, followed in order by proteus spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp., citrobacter spp. and e. coli. conspicuous changes in antimicrobial activity of antibiotics against e. coli and klebsiella spp. from simple uti have not been found in our survey. against strains of citrobacter spp., even the third generation cephems proved to be not remarkably active and there was a significant decrease in susceptibility of isolates to the  drugs test-showed mic values of 50 micrograms/ml and the proportion increased to  50% (22/44) with isolates obtained in 1982. the antimicrobial activity of cefsulodin and gentamicin against p. aeruginosa was decreased in 1982 compared with that in 1980 and 1981. however, resistant strains were slightly more frequent with gentamicin. in 1983, the antimicrobial activity of third generation cephems against serratia spp. was significantly reduced from that in 1982.

TI  == imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  == imipenem is a new broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, which when administered  with cilastatin may be a suitable alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside and either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole as therapy for intraabdominal infections. the clinical and microbiologic results for 164 assessable patients given imipenem/cilastatin for intraabdominal infections are reported. only three of 416 bacterial strains isolated prior to therapy from intraabdominal infection sites were resistant to imipenem (one of staphylococcus  epidermidis, one of morganella morganii, and one of the fusobacterium varium). resistance acquired during treatment was reported in four cases: for three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and for one strain of proteus mirabilis. of 412 strains susceptible to imipenem prior to therapy, 359 were eradicated during treatment. the frequency of clinical cure or improvement was 91%. imipenem/cilastatin seems to be a useful alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside with either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole.

TI  == review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin, mk0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. only rare strains of enterobacter species and proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. hemophilus and neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. only pseudomonas maltophilia  and pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (mic50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. all anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of clostridium difficile. staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (mic90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and s. faecium strains were frankly resistant. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates  had a mic90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and  some p. aeruginosa strains. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. the induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. the 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m2-a3). imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.

TI  == role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  == imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. cultures prior to therapy yielded staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group d and non-group d enterococci (49), group a streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), escherichia coli (32), proteus mirabilis (31), enterobacter (21), klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven p. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. imipenem/cilastatin appears to  be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both  polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these  bacteria is suspected or proved.

AB  == all strains of staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). augmentin is active  against penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. according to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "rsr" and "rrr" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are  chiefly found among enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter and indole + proteus; in  these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of proteus vulgaris strains. "rrs" and "rri" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.

TI  == aztreonam in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host  defenses.
AB  == a clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  aztreonam in hospital-acquired infections. twenty patients (13 men and 7 women) with impaired host defenses and nosocomial infections were treated with aztreonam at a dosage ranging 4 and 6 g/day i.v. at 8 or 12-hour intervals. average length  of therapy was 10.35 +/- 4.61 days. the isolated organisms were as follows: escherichia coli (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), enterobacter cloacae (1), proteus mirabilis (2), proteus vulgaris (1), acinetobacter anitratus (1), serratia marcescens (1), citrobacter freundii (1), bacteroides fragilis (3), bacteroides melaninogenicus (1). in 5 patients (25%) a  mixed infection was observed. sixteen patients (80%) were completely cured from infection and 24 isolated organisms (88.8%) were eradicated. no adverse reactions were observed. aztreonam has undoubtedly high clinical and bacteriological efficacy in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host defenses.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == binding of polymyxin b nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin b nonapeptide (pmbn) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled pmbn. smooth salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of pmbn per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) molecules of pmbn per single cell. the binding was of relatively high affinity (kd, 1.3 microm). the isolated outer membrane of s. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of pmbn per mg of outer membrane protein (kd, 1.1 microm), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of pmbn (escherichia coli strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of pmbn. the s. typhimurium pmra mutant, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and proteus mirabilis (all known  as resistant to polymyxin and pmbn) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than s. typhimurium, respectively. the binding of pmbn to s. typhimurium was effectively  inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin b, compound em49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. spermine, ca2+, and mg2+ also inhibited the pmbn binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin b, respectively. no binding inhibition was found at the  tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.

AB  == the production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. the genera were: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, rare enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. with this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. the data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. the nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of current disinfectants for leg bags.
AB  == an in vitro study was performed investigating the bactericidal ability of five common cleaning agents for leg bags against organisms frequently causing urinary  tract infection in spinal cord injured (sci) patients. individual disposable uridrain leg bags were inoculated with urine containing greater than 10(5) colonies/ml of the selected organism. the organisms used were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, herellea, and enterococcus. each pair of inoculated bags (one bag for immediate or 0 hour culture and one bag for 24 hour culture) was filled with 30 ml of the test solution, cleaned, drained, and then cultured. the  tested solutions included: plain tap water, 1/4% acetic acid, 3% hydrogen peroxide, sporicidin 1:16 dilution, and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. the results demonstrated that plain tap water had no effect on reducing the bacterial counts  and that 1/4% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide had only a marginal effect across the spectrum of organisms. sporicidin and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite exhibited complete bactericidal ability. in the final analysis, 0.06% sodium hypochlorite is the most cost efficient and readily accessible to patients. in practical application, disinfecting daily with 0.06% sodium hypochlorite can decrease external contamination of urinary drainage appliances in sci patients.

TI  == an evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980rp).
AB  == ceftiolene (42980rp) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. the affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight pbps of e. coli. enterobacter cloacae. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the affinity of ceftiolene for pbp1 of staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for pbp3. the bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against gram-negative organisms  was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into e. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene-  or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. growth of staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. these observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine mic determinations to distinguish  between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.

AB  == different compounds derived from choline, and obtained by demethylation or by oxidation of the primary alcohol group with subsequent n-demethylation, were tested as inducer agents of acid phosphatase and cholinesterase in ps. aeruginosa. it was found that betaine and dimethylglycine were the most effective inducers of both enzyme activities. these metabolites including choline itself, were not inducers of acid phosphatase and cholinesterase in other gram-negative bacteria such as: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, enterobacter liquefacciens and proteus mirabilis. the acid phosphatase activities found in these bacteria were not inhibited in vitro by choline, betaine and phosphorylcholine. from these results it may be concluded that the acid phosphatase activity from ps. aeruginosa is different from the same activity observed in the other bacteria. in addition, it is also shown that ps. aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase were inhibited by a number of compounds containing a positively charged amino group, with methyl or ethyl groups bound to it. these results seem to confirm that ps. aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase may contain a similar anionic site.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin b nonapeptide.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin b nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. the susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. the strains included representatives of escherichia coli with different o- and k-antigens, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, salmonella typhimurium, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  pseudomonas maltophilia. in contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin b nonapeptide.

TI  == low levels of functional of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in the promotion of c3-cleavage by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyema.
AB  == it has been suggested that c3 breakdown by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyemas may be related to a decreased inhibitor potential for these enzymes. in the present study it was shown that in 17 infected pleural effusions, high proteolytic activity on 125i-labeled c3 (16.3% +/- 4.4%) correlated with low functional levels of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-pi), as determined by  trypsin-inhibitory capacity (56.2 +/- 20.1 iu/ml; rs = -0.97, p less than .001),  whereas in 18 sterile pleural effusions there was no such correlation (125i-labeled c3 cleavage, 2.2% +/- .2%; trypsin-inhibitory capacity, 192.6 +/- 26.7 iu/ml). however, alpha 1-pi and alpha 2-macroglobulin protein concentrations in infected and sterile effusions (as measured by immunodiffusion) were similar.  fifteen strains of three bacterial species--streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis--isolated from patients with pneumonia or empyema inactivated the elastase-inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-pi in vitro. these results show that in empyemas functional levels of alpha 1-pi were too low  to inactivate granulocyte elastase and that some bacterial species may contribute to the low inhibitor potential of infected pleural fluid by direct alpha 1-pi inactivation.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial activity between l-norvalyl-l-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid and nocardicin a.
AB  == the phosphonopeptide l- norvalyl -l-1- aminoethylphosphonic acid [ nva -ala(p)] has been studied in combination with 12 beta-lactam antibiotics for activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. nocardicin a was found to give the most potent synergistic combination with nva -ala(p). this interaction was widely observed in clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa in vitro and in a mouse septicemia model. synergy was also observed in vitro and in vivo in several other species, including proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., and serratia marcescens. the interaction between nva -ala(p) and nocardicin a involved a strongly bacteriolytic mechanism. in addition, the individual components were complementary to one another in their action against organisms not showing synergy. these properties resulted in a broad spectrum of activity of the combination nva -ala(p) plus nocardicin a when used to treat experimental gram-negative bacterial infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.
AB  == two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline,  chloramphenicol and gentamicin. when the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the mics of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-a streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the mic of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. with staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the mics of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the mics of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. the effect of saliva on the susceptibility of e.  coli to tetracycline was also significant; mic50 and mic90 were reduced from 128  to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when e. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. the general significance of these observations is discussed.

TI  == chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == bacteriology of branched renal calculi and accompanying urinary tract infection.
AB  == we determined the bacteriology of apparently infected renal calculi and accompanying urinary tract infections, and assessed the potential clinical value  of the culture results. twenty-two branched renal calculi from 16 patients were cultured. fifteen calculi were infected with 1 or more urease-producing gram-negative enteric bacterium, 2 were infected with a urease-producing bacterium and a nonurease-producing organism, and 5 were sterile. immersion of infected stones in antimicrobial solutions before culture reduced or eliminated surface bacteria but usually did not eradicate bacteria within the stone. the bacteriology of a stone or stones could be predicted on the basis of available urine culture results in only 2 of the 16 cases. these data suggest that branched renal calculi associated with bacteriuria usually are infected but that documentation of infection and identification of the infecting organism require culture of the stone.

TI  == do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  == we examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (acb) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (ig). for this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with ig  preparations. these were obtained from infected urine either by removal of ig from acb (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 m glycine-hcl, or 3 m nascn) or by staphylococcal protein a affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. coincubation of either ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, several escherichia coli strains, enterococci, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with ig. coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation  with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. adsorption of ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. coating was observed both with intact igg and with f(ab)2 fragments. we further examined the proportion of  bacteria coated with iga, igg, and igm in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. the frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. it is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. a major problem of the acb test is definition of the normal range.

TI  == the effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  == previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore escherichia coli adherence to control levels. to determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella ozonae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3h-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. results were as follows: acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. the magnitude of klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. while this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against pseudomonas.

AB  == the in vitro activity of aztreoman (sq 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam inhibited 90% of citrobacter diversus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris and salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. this activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and shigella species. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited  by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. there was no major difference between mbc and mic values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon mic values was observed at 10(7) cfu.

TI  == use of rifampin for the treatment of serious staphylococcal and gram-negative bacillary infections.
AB  == the use of rifampin combined with other antimicrobial agents for the treatment of 40 serious bacterial infections against which other treatment regimens had failed was reviewed. seven of 17 staphylococcal infections (16 due to staphylococcus aureus and one due to staphylococcus epidermidis) were cured, as were 16 of 23 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. in vitro tests of interaction between rifampin and other antibiotics produced variable results. however, eight rifampin-resistant strains (six of s. aureus, one of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  one of proteus mirabilis) emerged during combination therapy in seven patients; the drugs involved were rifampin plus vancomycin in three instances, rifampin plus gentamicin in two, rifampin plus colistin in one, and rifampin plus pristinamycin in one. thus, while rifampin produced a dramatic beneficial effect  in some patients with serious bacterial infections, the emergence of resistant strains, even with dual drug therapy, was identified as a potential problem.

AB  == we investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages  ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. the clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones  were polymicrobial. significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: escherichia coli (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), pseudomonas cepacia (1), proteus mirabilis (5), serratia marcescens (2), klebsiella (2), enterobacter aerogenes (1) and haemophilus influenzae (1). total  dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). the overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by ps. aeruginosa.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics and complement by a nontoxic oligopeptide.
AB  == a major virulence factor of bacteria that cause generalized infections is their resistance to the lytic action of the complement cascade, an important defence mechanism of the host. invasive gram-negative enteric bacteria, which cause about one-third of all bacteraemic infections, are completely resistant to lysis by complement, even in the presence of hyperimmune serum. the same bacteria are also resistant to many antibiotics that are effective therapeutic agents against other bacteria, as the outermost surface layer (the outer membrane) of the bacteria functions as a permeability barrier. here we show that it is possible to sensitize such bacteria to both complement and antibiotics by using an agent that binds to the outer membrane. this agent is a nontoxic derivative of polymyxin which by itself has no bactericidal action.

TI  == comparative study of fosfomycin activity in mueller-hinton media and in tissues.
AB  == fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  l-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. the latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. the relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus  was studied in mueller-hinton broth. an almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin  activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. fosfomycin activity against staph. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of  the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of fosfomycin against staph. aureus streptococcus faecalis, e. coli, ent. cloacae, pr. mirabilis, and ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in mueller-hinton broth. with few exceptions the mics in mueller-hinton broth (with  glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).

TI  == effect of estrogen-promoted bacterial infections of the rat uterus on bioassay of mammalian cell growth factor activities in uterine luminal fluid.
AB  == exogenous estradiol treatment of intact or ovariectomized rats causes accumulation of significant volumes of fluid in the uterine horns. in this report, evidence is presented showing the presence of mammalian cell growth factor(s) in uterine luminal fluid (ulf), along with other data showing that the  exogenous estradiol treatment needed to cause significant accumulation of the fluid also facilitates the movement of vaginal origin bacteria into the uterine horns. it is shown that microorganisms infect the uteri of 80% or more of rats administered exogenous estradiol, and that the microorganisms are most probably of vaginal origin; procedures such as ligation of the uterine body above the cervix or antibiotic treatment did not suppress the infections. administration of different doses of exogenous estrogen by either implantation of a single 25-mg estradiol/cholesterol pellet which causes a 20- to 50-fold elevation of estradiol levels above physiological plasma concentrations, or instead, by a silastic tube  delivery method that elevates levels only 2- to 3-fold above the normal range, resulted in equal frequency of uterine infections and in the appearance of infection at the same time after starting treatment. a number of bacterial species are present in the contaminated ulf, and these are the origins of intracellular products which are potent inhibitors of mammalian cell growth; the  presence of these bacterial origin inhibitors interferes with the bioassay of the ulf growth factor activity, and hence, impedes the characterization of the growth factor(s) present in luminal fluid. characterization of the origins of the growth-inhibiting activities showed that pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are the predominant species present in infected uteri and that both produce exotoxin activities which inhibit growth of mammalian cells in culture; pseudomonas appears to be the greater producer of cytotoxic activity. evidence is presented that suggests that the well-known exotoxin a produced by pseudomonas may be responsible, in part, for the toxic effects of this organism. other, as yet unidentified, cell growth inhibitors also may be produced by the bacteria found in ulf. surgical separation of the uterine body from the cervix allows preparation of ulf which contains no bacteria and substantially reduced levels of growth inhibitors to mammalian cell lines.

TI  == biocidal braided sutures.
AB  == once sutures become contaminated it is difficult for local tissue defenses or antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria and prevent infection. impregnation of sutures with antibiotics before implantation is one way to prevent bacterial seeding of the suture surface. in this study, braided silk and dacron sutures were impregnated with the antibiotic complex, neomycin palmitate. using our standard wound model in the mouse, the efficacy of these biocidal sutures was determined in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. implantation of these biocidal sutures into tissue contaminated with 10(7) organisms resulted in substantially decreased numbers of bacteria as compared with that of tissue receiving control sutures. in most cases, the tissue bacterial counts in the presence of biocidal sutures were  also considerably lower than that for similarly contaminated tissue without a suture. consequently, the presence of the neomycin palmitate eliminated the infection-potentiating effect of the suture. the therapeutic benefit of the biocidal sutures was related to the dose of antibiotic complex and was not adversely affected by delaying suture implantation.

AB  == three carbenicillin-hydrolyzing penicillinases were found in proteus mirabilis strains, n-3, n-29, and gn79. the former two strains were isolated in 1978, but strain gn79 was one of our stock cultures isolated in 1965. these penicillinases  closely resembled each other, and the pse-1 and pse-4 enzymes produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, in their substrate profiles and kinetic properties for hydrolyzing various beta-lactams. however, differences were found in their molecular weights and isoelectric points which ranged from 22,000 to 27,000 and from 6.0 to 6.9, respectively. the antiserum against the purified penicillinase of n-29 cross-reacted with the enzyme of n-3 and inhibited its activity by more than 80%. the antiserum also reacted with the pse-1 and pse-4 enzymes. the antiserum did not react with the penicillinase from strain gn79 and the pse-2 and pse-3 enzymes of p. aeruginosa. enzyme production in n-3 and n-29 was mediated by r plasmids.

TI  == [microbial colonization of the nasopharynx, external auditory canal, hair of the  head and armpit in high performance swimmers].
AB  == from 50 high-performance swimmers, who were subdivided into three training groups, swabs were taken before and after the swimming training from the nose, throat and the external auditory canal, and bacterial samples were taken according to the rodac method from the hair of the head and the armpit for a quantitative and qualitative analysis. - no significant quantitation differences  were found to exist in the bacterial flora before and after the swimming training, except for the external auditory canal where the bacterial population had increased, and the armpit where it had diminished. - a qualitative comparison of the normal flora revealed no noticeable differences in the population before and after the swimming training for the three training groups. - however, differences in the pathogenic flora were identified in the three training groups. a higher germ count was found in those swimmers who had been training more intensely for a longer period of time than the members of a junior training group. this finding is particularly striking for p. aeruginosa which was located  in the ears of those high-performance swimmers who belonged to the group with the most intensive swimming training. the carriers of staph. aureus accounted for 46  per cent of the test persons. this species had primarily settled in the vestibule of the nose. - the swimming training hardly influences the invasion of the hair of the head with pathogens. the compulsory use of bathing cap serves general hygienic aspects rather than prophylactic hygienic purposes.

TI  == organic acids and anaerobic microorganisms in the contents of the cholesteatoma sac.
AB  == organic acids in the contents of the cholesteatoma sac from 28 cases were studied by gas chromatographic technique. five volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate and isovalerate) and lactate were detected in large amounts, which may lower the ph of the cholesteatoma content. these acids were considered to be derived from products of anaerobic microorganisms. therefore, the contents from 12 cases were cultured anaerobically in a glove box. obligate microorganisms were identified in 92% of the cases and peptococcus, bacteroides,  and clostridium species were frequently isolated. in vitro, such obligate anaerobes produced various organic acids from the cholesteatoma content. facultatives such as staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis produced acetate in the content under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas no organic acid was produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa. organic acids in the cholesteatoma content could be fermentative products made by the microorganisms, anaerobes and  facultatives, which use the content as a substrate for acid production.

TI  == antibacterial activity of norfloxacin.
AB  == norfloxacin, a new quinoline derivative, was studied in vitro, and determinations of agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and broth dilution mics and mbcs were made. nalidixic acid and cinoxacin were used as comparative agents. norfloxacin was found to be extremely active against all strains tested of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. serratia spp., citrobacter spp., and enterobacter spp., with mics normally below 1 microgram/ml. it also was found to be highly active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococci, which are all resistant to nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. the mics for norfloxacin obtained by broth dilution were slightly higher than those obtained by agar dilution, whereas the reverse was true for nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. the mbcs of norfloxacin were only slightly higher than the mics, even at high inocula. the in vitro activity of norfloxacin was not dependent on the inoculum size, whereas both the  mics and the mbcs of nalidixic acid increased markedly for many of the strains tested when the inoculum was increased in broth dilution from 10(3) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. norfloxacin seems to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infections, especially those caused by pseudomonas spp. and other species today requiring the use of injectable antibiotics.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  == bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. the mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.

TI  == phh502, a plasmid with incp and inci alpha characters, loses the latter by a specific reca-independent deletion event.
AB  == plasmid phh502, of molecular weight 70 x 10(6), determined resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulphonamides and mercuric chloride  and was incompatible with members of incp and inci alpha. it resembled other plasmids of inci alpha in the following properties: it determined pili that were  morphologically and serologically i alpha pili, whose production was repressed in established plasmid-carrying (r+) cultures; its transfer was equally efficient in liquid or on solid medium; it exerted surface exclusion against other inci alpha  plasmids; it was non-transferable to proteus. in a reproducible, reca-independent event, phh502 gave rise to phh502-1, a plasmid of molecular weight 40 x 10(6), lacking determinants for resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol and all detectable inci alpha characteristics. phh502-1 was incompatible only with incp plasmids and resembled other incp plasmids in determining constitutive production of rigid pili, in its surface exclusion, in transferring at greater frequency on  solid than in liquid medium and in being transmissible to proteus mirabilis. it differed from other incp plasmids in the morphology and serological type of its pili and in failing to transfer to pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter calcoaceticus. small numbers of phh502-1 rigid pili were present on bacteria carrying phh502. possible mechanisms for the generation of phh502 and phh502-1 are discussed.

TI  == preliminary report comparing piperacillin and carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == piperacillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens. we compared the efficacy and safety of piperacillin versus carbenicillin in patients with complicated urinary tract infection. a total of 56 adult patients (mean age 55 years) in stable medical condition with 1 or more structural genitourinary abnormalities entered the study. of these patients 27 were evaluated for antibiotic efficacy. there were 20 lower tract and 7 upper tract infections, of which 17 were acute and 10 were chronic. patients were randomized into 2 groups:  17 patients with 18 organisms received single agent treatment with 181 mg. per kg. intravenous piperacillin daily for 6 days and 10 patients with 11 organisms received 270 mg. per kg. intravenous carbenicillin daily for 6 days. infecting organisms were escherichia coli 45 per cent, proteus mirabilis 14 per cent, klebsiella pneumoniae 14 per cent. enterobacter species 10 per cent, pseudomonas  aeruginosa 7 per cent and so forth. antimicrobial susceptibility assessed by measurement of minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion zone size demonstrated superior activity of piperacillin over carbenicillin for most micro-organisms tested. all patients responded clinically. the bacteriologic cure rate was 72 per cent at 5 to 9 days after therapy in both groups. three patients  who received piperacillin had urosepsis and were cured. no resistance emerged during therapy. superinfections developed in 5 patients on carbenicillin (50 per  cent) and in 4 patients on piperacillin (24 per cent), and none was resistant to  piperacillin. superinfections were attributed to catheterization and structural genitourinary abnormalities. the over-all incidence of adverse effects in patients on piperacillin was less than that of those on carbenicillin, 31 and 51  per cent respectively. side effects in both groups were mild and did not require  discontinuation of therapy. there were no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, or hematologic or renal function.

TI  == comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for h. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. cefotaxime was the most active agent against h. influenzae;  it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. it was also the most active agent against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid salmonella species, and yersinia enterocolitica. cefotaxime was among the most active agents against  enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter species, shigella species, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. none of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.

TI  == determination of the range of antibacterial activity by use of viable counts.
AB  == the activity of three aminoglycosides and six beta-lactam antibiotics on strains  of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci was studied. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), and the minimal antibiotic concentrations (macs) were determined after 5 h of incubation in broth cultures by colony-forming-unit counts. the mics were also determined by agar dilution after 24 h of incubation. the mics on agar after 24 h of incubation were higher than those in broth after 5 h of incubation. the differences ranged from 1.1- to 14.2-fold, but in most cases were only three- to  fivefold (p less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). the mbcs at 5 and 24 h were comparable in 71% of tests. for current practice, the mbc of enterococci can be determined after 5 h of incubation with antibiotics. the aminoglycosides showed mbcs which were closer to the mics than were those of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which required a higher multiple of the mic to show a bactericidal effect. the mbcs of oxacillin and cefamandole for s. aureus after 5 h of incubation were greater than 128 times the respective mics. the macs ranged from  1/1.5 to 1/7 of the 5-h mics. the three endpoints, mic, mbc, and mac, indicate the antibacterial range of an antibiotic in terms of inhibition of growth and bacterial survival. the data suggest that the antibacterial range of an antibiotic is similar for most strains of a given species and is, to some extent, a characteristic of similar antibiotics.

AB  == a fully automated method for detecting significant bacteriuria is described which uses firefly luciferin and luciferase to detect bacterial atp in urine. the automated method was calibrated and evaluated, using 308 urine specimens, against two reference culture methods. we obtained a specificity of 0.79 and sensitivity  of 0.75 using a quantitative pour plate reference test and a specificity of 0.79  and a sensitivity of 0.90 using a semiquantitative standard loop reference test.  the majority of specimens negative by the automated test but positive by the pour plate reference test were specimens which grew several bacterial species. we suggest that such disagreement was most likely for urine containing around 10(5)  colony-forming units per ml (the culture threshold of positivity) and that these  specimens were ones contaminated by urethral or vaginal flora. we propose standard procedures for calibrating and evaluating rapid or automated methods for the detection of significant bacteriuria and have analyzed our results using these procedures. we recommend that identical analyses should be reported for other evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.

AB  == the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime were evaluated  against 700 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ceftazidime was less active than penicillins or older cephalosporins against staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., and it did not inhibit streptococcus faecalis, listeria, or anaerobic species. ceftazidime was as active as ceftizoxime and moxalactam and more active than cefoperazone against escherichia coli. klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than 0.2 mg/liter. ceftazidime also inhibited enterobacter, citrobacter, salmonella, and shigella at concentrations below 0.2 mg/liter. most morganella, proteus rettgeri, proteus vulgaris, and proteus inconstans were inhibited at concentrations below 1 mg/liter, similar to the concentrations for moxalactam, ceftizoxime, and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the most active agent tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean minimal inhibitory concentration of 1.6 mg/liter. it inhibited carbenicillin-, piperacillin-, cefoperazone-, and cefsulodin-resistant  pseudomonas. minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar, with the exception of some pseudomonas values at 10(7) colony-forming units. use of different media did not alter minimal inhibitory concentration values. ceftazidime was not hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamase or plasmid beta-lactamase of the tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, oxa-1, pse-1, pse-2 types or by inducible beta-lactamases of the cephalosporinase type. ceftazidime provides an extremely active agent against aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

TI  == cefotaxime treatment of skin and skin structure infections: a multicenter study.
AB  == the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefotaxime, a new parenteral cephalosporin resistant to beta-lactamase, were evaluated in a multicenter open trial. the study population comprised 594 hospitalized patients with infections of the skin or subcutaneous tissue. of these, 409 patients fulfilled the protocol requirements for assessment of clinical efficacy. usual dosages of cefotaxime were in the range of 1.5 to 12 gm/day for 5 to 85 days. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent gram-positive organism; proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most frequent gram-negative bacilli; and peptococcus sp, the most frequent anaerobic organism isolated. of the 409 evaluable patients, 382 (93.4%) were clinically cured. bacteriological cures were obtained in 316 of 372 (84.9%) patients. reactions to cefotaxime included asymptomatic eosinophilia, rash, drug fever, phlebitis, and elevated hepatic enzyme levels. all reactions were transient, and drug therapy had to be terminated in only eight patients. cefotaxime proved effective for treating a variety of skin and soft tissue infections. the lack of serious toxicity and adverse reactions associated with cefotaxime, together with its broad antimicrobial spectrum, makes it a suitable substitute for aminoglycosides in certain clinical settings.

AB  == three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. all three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against streptococcus ssp. cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against streptococcus aureus. ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except enterobacter spp. ceftizoxime was active against all, except enterobacter  spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. although cefotiam was quite active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive proteus spp., serratia spp, and p. aeruginosa. the in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum  antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == contamination of chlorhexidine cream used to prevent ascending urinary tract infections.
AB  == chlorhexidine-containing cream is often used as an antimicrobial barrier to ascending urinary tract infection in patients with indwelling urethral catheters. the cream is dispensed in small tubes for personal use but repeated use of a tube still entails a potential infection hazard. the extent of cream contamination was analysed by emulsifying it in 1% peptone broth with 1% tween-80 added as a wetting agent, and culturing quantitatively for bacteria and fungi by membrane filtration. twenty-three per cent of cream samples and 35% of swabs taken from outside the tube beneath the screw cap demonstrated microbial contamination. isolates included potential pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, opportunists like moraxella spp. and diphtheroids, and contaminants such as bacillus spp., micrococci, and a mould of  the genus cladosporium. contamination of cream with a particular bacterial strain was found to precede urinary tract infection with the same microbe. we recommend  that chlorhexidine cream for this use be dispensed in single dose units to ensure sterility.

TI  == detection of potential biochemical indicators of infection in the burned rat.
AB  == sever thermal injury is often complicated by infection. moreover, the injury itself render the early detection of infection more difficult. rapid early detection of infection would thus aid in the treatment of severely burned patients. pca filtrates of whole blood from burned-infected rats contain three substances that appear to be early indicators of infection in the thermally injured animal. these factors are only slightly affected by the extent of injury. these factors do not appear to be microorganism-specific in that they are found in rats infected with proteus mirabilis as well as with pseudomonas aeruginosa. one factor absorbs light at 398 nm and seems to be associated with some cellular  component of blood. the other two substances are fluorescent, one gamma ex 280 nm gamma em 340 nm, the other gamma 355 nm gamma em 420 nm, and are detectable in pca filtrates of plasma as well as of whole blood. all factors are retained by filters with a 25,000 dalton pore size. all factors are precipitable from pca filtrates by phosphotungstic acid, suggesting that they may be proteins. the 355/420 factor increases with oxidation, whereas both the 280/340 substance and 398 nm material decrease.

AB  == persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. the persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. with gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. with gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. inhibitors of protein and rna synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa. the duration of the  postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration  of exposure up to a point of maximal response. persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.

TI  == comparison of mezlocillin and carbenicillin as therapy for various infectious diseases.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of mezlocillin, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin, were compared with those of carbenicillin in a nonblind, controlled clinical study in 89 adult patients. the infections treated were primarily those  of the urinary tract, skin, and gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract. escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the causative organisms isolated most frequently. a complete resolution of signs and symptoms was achieved in 78% of the mezlocillin patients and in 71% of  the carbenicillin patients. in the mezlocillin group, causative organisms were eliminated in 80% of the courses, and in the carbenicillin group the elimination  rate was 86%. two adverse reactions, rash and diarrhea, were reported in mezlocillin-treated patients; none were reported for the carbenicillin group.

AB  == ro 13-9904, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was found to have high in vitro activity against enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria, including various isolates resistant to cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin.  it showed promising activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. although inhibitory  against staphylococcus aureus at concentrations readily achievable in plasma, it  was less potent against this pathogen than cefamandole, cefazolin, or cefuroxime. isolates of streptococcus faecalis were uniformly resistant to all the cephalosporins tested. ro 13-9904 was more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae, but less active against s. aureus. ro 13-9904 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases. its therapeutic efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice was equal to or slightly superior to that of cefotaxime and sce-1365 when the antibiotics were administered in repeated subcutaneous doses after bacterial challenge. cefoperazone, and particularly cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, and mezlocillin were less effective. although structurally related to  cefotaxime and sce-1365, ro 13-9904 was found to differ from them in one important respect, namely, in having a long duration of action; this was observed with single-dose treatment given before bacterial challenge. its broad spectrum of activity coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties make ro 13-9904 a promising compound for clinical studies.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

AB  == fk 749 is a distinctive new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum which is more potently active against a wide variety of gram-negative bacilli, including the opportunistic pathogens such as citrobacter  and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens, than sce 963, t 1551 and cefmetazole. the activity of fk 749 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pyogenes was by far superior to that of the three other antibiotics.  these test organisms were not resistant to fk 749. the antibacterial activity of  fk 749 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was almost the same as that of ticarcillin  but was inferior to that of gentamicin and t 1551. the bactericidal activity of fk 749 against e. coli, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis was more potent than  that of the three other antibiotics. fk 749, like cefmetazole, was extremely stable to beta-lactamases. in studies in mice, the therapeutic effect of subcutaneous injection of fk 749 against various infections due to gram-negative  bacilli was by far superior to that of sce 963, t 1551 and cefmetazole, was almost the same as that of sce 963 and cefmetazole against staphylococcus aureus  infection and that of ticarcillin against p. aeruginosa infection.

TI  == synthesis of a selective agar medium for yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a new agar medium for isolation of yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. the final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(cin) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees c or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees c. the medium was highly selective, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. colony morphology coupled with a differential  reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of y. enterocolitica from most of those gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. recovery and selective characteristics of cin agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. cin agar gave a higher recovery of y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than salmonella-shigella (0.0/0.7%) and macconkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.

TI  == lethal effect of complement and lysozyme on polymyxin-treated, serum-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == when genetically serum-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and citrobacter freundii, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa or proteus mirabilis, were exposed to polymyxin b, they became susceptible to the bactericidal action of normal human and rabbit sera. in constrast, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics did not render any serum-resistant bacteria serum-sensitive. synergy  between polymyxin b and the serum bactericidal system could be demonstrated by the addition of polymyxin b to bacteria in vitro, as well as to bacilli in serum  from rabbits injected with the antibiotic. polymyxin b-treated bacteria were killed by normal, lysozyme-depleted, c2-deficient, and hypogammaglobulinemic sera, but not by heated or c6-deficient sera. these findings indicate that polymyxin b-treated bacteria can be killed via the alternative complement pathway. however, c3 and c3b were detected on the surface of serum-resistant e. coli, regardless of whether the bacteria had been treated with polymyxin b. this  observation suggests that a change in susceptibility to the alternative complement pathway was not the only explanation for the acquired serum sensitivity. polymyxin b may also affect a step in the complement sequence beyond the activation of c3, a step that is apparently blocked in serum-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus spp. (indole positive), enterobacter spp., salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, and staphylococcus aureus. in every comparison, except that with the last organism, hr 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. all three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, hr 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. hr 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of streptococcus pyogenes,  lancefield group d streptococci, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against bacteriodes fragilis.  hr 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of  these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. hr 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against s. pyogenes; against lancefield group d,  penicillin was 32 times as active as hr 756. hr 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (p. aeruginosa and group d streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. a series of seven transfers of selected strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp., s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa through medium containing hr 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. resistance to hr 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.

AB  == the autobac i provides an automated method for the rapid measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility of fast growing pathogenic microorganisms. to check  instrument accuracy, 477 cultures were tested by the bauer-kirby method for comparison. according to the din limits, the results were comparable in 81.8%, whereas within the nccls limits the agreement was 86.5%. the discrepancy was found to be due to incorrect disc mass and different limits of inhibitory zone diameters. another reason for disagreement seemed to be the incubation time, since its influence on the results varied when different bacterium/antibiotic combinations were used.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of urine collected from adult male paraplegics ingesting methenamine mandelate (mm) was evaluated. the in vitro bacterial growth in urine from these patients was inhibited when the free formaldehyde (hcho) concentration was 10 to 22 microgram per ml. when the hcho concentration was in the region of 28 microgram per ml or greater, bactericidal effect became apparent. urine containing 1323 microgram of mm per ml with a ph of 5.9 when freshly voided had sufficient hcho to be bacteriostatic. urine containing at least 1740 microgram of mm per ml with a ph of 5.1 or less when freshly voided was bactericidal. the latter concentration of mm in urine was usually achieved when the patient ingested 4 g of mm per day in divided doses and the intake of fluid was not excessive. under some circumstances an individual receiving mm without an additional acidifying agent may produce urine with a ph low enough to  release sufficient hcho to exert a useful antibacterial effect. however, supplementary acidification with ammonium chloride produced marked lowering of the urinary ph in all patients receiving mm, resulting in bactericidal levels of  hcho.

AB  == fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (brl 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. ticarcillin mics were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. thirty-nine strains of enterobacteriaceae tested included escherichia coli (14), klebsiella pneumoniae (16), citrobacter sp. (3), enterobacter sp. (3), salmonella enteritidis (1), serratia marcescens (1), and proteus mirabilis (1). ticarcillin mics for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. against 33 strains (85%), the mics were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. in contrast, the mics for seven of eight strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (mic >/= 2,048 mug/ml) e. coli, k. pneumoniae, enterobacter, and p. mirabilis.

AB  == as a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to pseudomonas aeruginosa (pg) were studied in acute infections in mice. pg was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of p. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse  protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of  p. aeruginosa. pg was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. the active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the igg type and undoubltedly is directed against the o-antigen. pg was was not protective against challenge with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, or klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against serratia marcescens. in a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced p. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to p. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. the apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. it is postulated that  the successful treatment of advanced p. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.

AB  == a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of  the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a  potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and  cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.

TI  == intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  == several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. the following species: proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -ii. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.

TI  == [studies on the activation of humoral defense factors against bacteria in larvae  of the wax moth galleria mellonella l].
AB  == the change of lysozyme activity in the hemolymph of the wax moth larvae caused by vaccination is influenced by the size and the dose of the injected particles. the rate of incorporation of those particles into phagocytes has no effect on this process. the change of lysozyme activity correlats negatively with the amount of  granulocytes after vaccination. there were no correlations with the amount of other types of the hemocytes, neither with the resistance of the larvae against pseudomonas aeruginosa nor with the survival of gram-negative bacteria within the hemocoelom. origin, regulation and role of lysozyme are discussed regarding the defence against gram-negative bacteria. in the hemolymph of wax moth larvae after vaccination the formation of spheroblasts has been observed with all gram-negative strains of bacteria studied. the speed and extent of the formation  of spheroblasts corresponded to the pathogenicity of these bacteria for the larvae as well as to the survival of the bacteria within the hemocoelom.

TI  == sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria to six aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  == an in vitro study of the susceptibility of 201 newly isolated strains of gramnegative bacteria to six aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and netilmicin) was performed by the twofold dilution method in fluid medium. both the minimal inhibitory concentration and the minimal bacteridical concentration were determined. overall, tobramycin seemed the most effective of the drugs studied. netilmicin, the new derivative from sisomicin, compared favourably with the other drugs tested, but may, on theoretical grounds, offer the additional advantage of retained efficacy in the face of developing bacterial resistance. not unexpectedly, amikacin appeared to be the most promising of the drugs studied in its action against pseudomonas aeruginosa. amikacin and netilmicin appeared to be the most effective of this group of antibiotics against klebsiella species.

AB  == antibiotic sensitivity of 292 strains of proteus, 60 strains of ps, aeruginosa, 309 strains of s. aureus and 88 strains of s. epidermidis isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients with scleroma and ozena was studied. the cultures of pr. mirabilis were sensitive to aminoglucosides (54.9-96.2 per cent) and pr. morganii were sensitive to levomycetin (81.5 per cent) and neomycin (92.6 per cnet). sensitivity of pr. vulgaris and pr. morganii was reliably higher (p less than 0.001) than that of pr. mirabilis. the strains of pr. morganii were less sensitive to monomycin (p less than 0.001) and streptomycin (p less than 0.01) as compared to the cultures of other proteus species tested. the strains of ps. aeruginosa were sensitive only to gentamicin (90 per cent) and neomycin (81.1 per cent). most of the strains of s. aureus (85.4-100 per cent) were sensitive to oleadomycin, erythromycin, olemorphocycline, tetraolean, oxacillin, methicillin ceporin, lincomycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and gentamicin. benzylpenicillin (90.8 per cent of the sensitive strains), ampicillin (67.1 per cent), tetracycline (66.7 per cent), levomycetin (68.6 per cent) and streptomycin (38.1 per cent) were less effective. antibacterial therapy in cases with scleroma and ozena should be directed not only against causative agents of the diseases but also against the microbes developing due to disbacteriosis. combination of parenteral and local use of the antibiotics in the treatment of chronic clebsiellesis decreased the isolation rate of proteus and ps. aeruginosa in the patients.

AB  == the in vitro activity of netilmicin (sch 20569), a new semisynthetic derivative of gentamicin, was compared with that of gentamicin and amikacin. one hundred and ninety-two clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were tested using both agar and broth dilution techniques.  netilmicin was comparable to gentamicin, with the following exceptions: (i) for serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa, gentamicin was more active than netilmicin; (ii) all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to gentamicin,  were susceptible to netilmicin; (iii) some strains of s. marcescens, indole-positive proteus, and providencia, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin. netilmicin was more active than amikacin for all  enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus and equal to amikacin in activity against gentamicin-susceptible strains of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa, resistant to gentamicin, were also resistant to netilmicin but were susceptible to amikacin. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained with broth and agar showed no significant differences except for p. mirabilis, where broth mics  were twofold greater than agar mics, and for p. aeruginosa, where agar mics were  twofold higher than broth mics. the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) was  either identical to or within one twofold dilution of the mic for the strains tested. a 100-fold increase in inoculum size produced less increase in mic and mbc with netilmicin than with gentamicin or amikacin.

TI  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin c derivative i. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6r,7r)-8-oxo-7[2-(1h-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris. the activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of p. mirabilis. the in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both s. aureus and e. coli. the development in vitro  of resistance by s. aureus 209p and e. coli nihj to ceftezole after 16 transfers  was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. ceftezole was  relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with  streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae or p. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. however, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with s. aureus.

AB  == this last communication on the results of an one-year computer follow-up of single, double, and multiple antibiotic resistance of so-called problem bacteria  in slovakia presents computerised data on double, and important triple, quadruple and quintuple resistance of klebsiella-enterobacter, p. mirabilis and ps. aeruginosa strains. bi- and multi-resistant strains absolutely prevail in klebsiella (more than 60% of many thousands of strains tested), p. mirabilis (90%) and ps. aeruginosa (95%). special strict surveillance should be imposed on  these strains, namely on those coming from hospitals, and on their resistance developments concerning those few drugs which are fully (gentamicin and colistin, except for proteus) or individually effective (streptomycin, carbenicillin, septrin, nalidixic acid). mutual co-selectivity of bi-resistance has been identified in klebsiella-aerobacter toward gentamycin-colistin. although this does not take place in ps. aeruginosa, it is similar to the development in e. coli, and to the one-way co-selection of combined oxacillin-lincomycin resistance in staphylococci in this country. should this co-selective trend continue, even promoted by the spread of r plasmids, it may happen that the treatment of infections caused especially by these three (or four) species will be seriously jeopardized.

TI  == susceptibility of "enterobacteria" to penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycins, erythromycin, and rifampin.
AB  == agar dilution tests for susceptibility of gram-negative rods and enterococci were done with a number of penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycin analogues, erythromycin, and rifampin. many in the first three categories were investigational drugs. all were generally less active than aminoglycoside and tetracycline antibiotics against gram-negative rods and more active against enterococci. cephalosporins as a group were more active than penicillins against  klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli and less active enterococci. both groups were equally active against enterobacter, proteus, and providencia but inactive against most strains of serratia and all strains of pseudomonas; however, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and bl-1654 were active against most strains of pseudomonas. penicillins and cephalosporins were more active against proteus mirabilis than against indole-positive proteus. lincomycins had little or no activity against gram-negative rods but were moderately active against enterococci. erythromycin was more active than the lincomycins, but rifampin was  much more active than either of these types of drug. of the penicillins, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and bl-p1654 were the most active against gram-negative rods, whereas bl-p1654, amoxicillin, and ampicillin were the most active against enterococci. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cyclacillin, and penicillin v were essentially inactive against gram-negative rods. of the cephalosporins tested, cephanone and cefamandole were the most active against most gram-negative rods, whereas cephaloridine and cephacetrile were the most active against enterococci. the least active of the cephalosporins against most species were cephradine, cephalexin, and cephapirin, but cefoxitin was the least  active against enterococci.

TI  == factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  == the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus aureus (smith), serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. with p. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum  agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. passive immunity against p. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. with s. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. the results further demonstrate that with p. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in  the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.

TI  == accelerated healing in infected wounds.
AB  == the effect of a standardized infection of pure and mixed cultures of gram-negative bacteria and a gram-positive coccus was studied in laparotomy wounds of rats. the infections were significantly stronger than in the control group wounds in 14 of 15 comparisons. this increased strength could not be correlated with an increased wound content of collagen. results of histologic studies showed a vigorous inflammatory response which probably was responsible for the increased strength. there was a suggestion in our data to support the concept that certain bacteria evoke the proper inflammatory response to result in stronger wounds, while others provoke too little or too much inflammation.

TI  == [resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides in gram negative bacteria. 1. molecular and genetic characterization of r-factors (author's transl)].
AB  == with frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to these chemotherapeutics increased. lately, strains of e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia, proteus and pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials  (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the university hospital in zuerich. the resistant phenotype of two representative strains (klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred by mixed cultivation to e. coli k-12. multiple resistance of strain 1, and addition, could be transferred to salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, providencia, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. transfer to pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. spontaneous instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages ms-2 and if-1 suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular r-factor, belonging to the fi+-type. this suggestion  was confirmed by molecular characterization of the resistance plasmids. after transfer of the r-factors of k. pneumoniae 1 (r-fk 1) and serratia marcescens 2 (r-fk2) into e. coli k-12, plasmid dna was labelled with (methyl-3h) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. analysis of plasmid dna then was carried out by sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral  sucrose gradient together with reference plasmids of known molecular weights and  sedimentation constants. the analysis revealed that r-fk1 had a molecular weight  of 54 x 10(6) and r-fk2 of 50 x 10(6) daltons. the values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open circular forms with an electron microscope. a comparison of the sedimentation profile of labelled plasmid dna from strain 1 and 14c-labelled dna of e. coli k-12 (r-fk1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. these smaller plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 1, which did not contain the 54 x 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for the resistant phenotype. the number of copies of r-fk1 in e. coli k-12 was determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of  replication. it is discussed that the growing number of isolations of strains of  escherichia, klebsiella, serratia, proteus, providencia and pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance phenotype, results from the spread of the r-factor described above among the hospital bacterial flora.

AB  == normal vaginal fluid from premenopausal volunteers was inoculated with 10 strains of proteus mirabilis and 14 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph's of 4.3, 4.6 and 4.9. all bacteria were killed at ph 4.3. nine of 10 strains of proteus mirabilis and 12 of 14 pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at ph 4.6. only 4 of 14 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at ph 4.9, while 8 of 10 strains of proteus mirabilis were killed at the same ph. we conclude that in comparison to the common 0 group strains of escherichia coli, vaginal fluid is more bactericidal to proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa and that these observations may help explain the relative infrequency of bacteriuria owing to the organisms.

AB  == gentamicin (gm) was studied for on its antibacterial activity, absorption, and excretion, effect on the kidney and clinical effects. the results obtained are as follows: 1. antibacterial activity: the susceptibility of e. coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis to gm was almost the same between the periods of 1964 to 1966 and 1972 to 1974: no tendency of increase of resistance by year was noted. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains showing sensitivity to a concentration of more than 25 mcg/ml were isolated in 12.7%, in the latter period (1972-1974), as compared with the former period (1964-1966), which was 0%. 2. blood levels: the peak level of gm in blood was obtained at 30 minutes after intramuscular injection to a healthy human. the peak level was 7.6 mcg/ml with 40 mg dose, 8.7 mcg/ml with 60 mg and 10.6 mcg/ml with 80 mg, showing a dose-responding curve. the half-life of gm absorption was 1.1 hours with 40 mg dose, 1.3 hours with 60 mg and 1.6 hours with 80 mg, showing also a dose related  tendency. 3. urinary levels: the peak level of gm in urine, about 200 mcg/ml, was noted in 0-2 hours after intramuscular injection of gm to a healthy human. the urinary recovery was about 44% in 6 hours. 4. effect on the kidney: the effects of gm on the kidney was studied in rats administering 20 mg/kg once a day for 21  days consecutively. the results obtained are a slight increase (20 mg/dl) in bun  and a slight decrease (2,600 mosm/kg h2o) in urinary osmotic pressure; and urea lysozyme showed tendency to increase from the third day, the same as with kanamycin. meanwhile, in the histopathological findings of the kidney tissue, the vacuolar degeneration and flattening of renal tubules were noted. similar findings were obtained with kanamycin in a similar type of experiment. these results indicate that nephrotoxicity of gm is considered to be approximately the  same as that of kanamycin. 5. clinical results: gm was injected into 22 patients  with various infectious diseases (respiratory tract infections 7, liver abscess 1, urinary tract infections 14). excellent efficacy was noted in 7 patients, good in 13 and no effect in 2. the effective rate was 90.9%. no serious side effect was noted in this clinical trial.

TI  == polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  == current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. the validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the west haven veterans  administration hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how  many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). during 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and  the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. in these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4  months before the episode of bacteremia. only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). the mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time  of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. prospectively, nine other patients  with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). this study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.

AB  == a survey of the occurrence of resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria revealed a 3-fold increase in the percentage of resistant  strains between 1974 (4%), and 1976 (12%). gentamicin resistance was mainly found in isolates from hospitalized patients. serratia (35--78%), proteus inconstans (53--62%), klebsiella (6--21%), acinetobacter (9--17%) and pseudomonas (9--14%) exhibited the highest percentage of resistance to this drug. gentamicin inactivating enzymes were detected in 16 selected resistant isolates. of these, ten strains (klebsiella, serratia, pseudomonas, e. coli) produced the aminoglycoside 2''-adenylyltransferase, five (proteus, indole-positive) the aminoglycoside 2'-n-acetyltransferase and one isolate (proteus mirabilis) the aminoglycoside 3-n-acetyltransferase. eight of the 16 strains were able to transfer gentamicin resistance and certain other resistance markers to appropriate receptor strains during mixed cultivation, indicating the presence of transferable plasmid-mediated resistance.

AB  == the effect of automated continuous irrigation treatment with actihaemyl on bacterial growth in the infected urinary bladder was tested using an experimental model. the result was that instillation alone of this preparation promoted growth of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the infected bladder. with simultaneous application of framycetinsulfate or kanamycin the growth of pr. mirabilis and ps. aeruginosa was totally suppressed in the "urine", and the growth of e. coli extensively low. at the same time there was a  clear reduction in the bacterial count in the coagulum that served as a substitute bladder wall. thus a urinary tract infection is a contraindication for local treatment with actihaemyl of a tropically disturbed urinary bladder inasmuch as an effective antibiotic is not added to the instillate. with the latter combination, however, a therapeutic trial is justified in chronic, inflammatory, dystrophic bladders.

(ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == beta-lactamases (ec. 3.5.2.6) from strains of gram-negative bacteria have been studied using analytical isoelectric focusing. this permits a visual comparison of the patterns of beta-lactamase bands produced by enzymes from different organisms. purification of crude intracellular preparations is unnecessary and the technique is sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate beta-lactamase in mutants  previously reported to lack the enzyme. r that have not been distinguished from one another biochemically or immunologically can be differentiated by isoelectric focusing. conversely, the enzymes specified by the r factors rtem, r1 and rgn14,  with identical isoelectric focusing patterns have the same biochemical properties. chromosomal and r-factor-mediated beta-lactamases from single strains have been separated and their identities confirmed by immunoisoelectric focusing. r factor-mediated enzymes gave identical isoelectric focusing patterns irrespective of the host strain. isoelectric focusing can therefore be used to observe the transfer of beta-lactamases carried by r factors.

TI  == comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  == two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, prepodyne and betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. a standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. complete cidal activty was exhibited by both prepodyne and betadine. twenty-five subjects  were tested in hand washing experiments using betadine and prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. it can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.

TI  == effectiveness of achievable urinary concentrations of tetracyclines against "tetracycline-resistant" pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or other bacterial pathogens are frequently treated with parenteral antibiotics such as gentamicin. many of these organisms are shown by kirby-bauer  disk sensitivity testing to be resistant to tetracycline. one hundred seventy-one such tetracycline-resistant bacterial isolates were studied; 84% were found to be sensitive to achievable urinary concentrations of tetracycline. two patients with long-standing chronic urinary tract infection with pseudomonas were treated with  tetracycline for a year and a half with excellent results. in a pilot clinical trial, eight of 12 hospitalized patients with urinary tract infection were treated successfully with tetracycline without regard to disk sensitivity data. institution of tetracycline as soon as the microscopic diagnosis of urinary tract infection is made might be an acceptable empiric approach to the treatment of urinary infection in hospitalized patients who do not show evidence of sepsis.

TI  == [experimental investigations concerning spectrum, serum concentration, and excretion of spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  == by means of the diffusion test, the range of action of the ampicillin successive  preparation spectacillin was determined using 12 000 pathological germs freshly isolated from in-patients. the result was a range of action similar to that of ampicillin. a comparison, however, is only possible in case the test platelets (without over-dosage) are each charged with exactly, e.g., 25 gamma. the analyses of serum concentrations have shown that spectacillin is satisfactorily absorbed after oral as well as after parenteral application. thus, the calculation of the  accumulated area of infinity beneath the serum concentration curve had the following results: after single intravenous injection of 1 g spectacillin (n equals 12) 51.46 gamma/ml - h; after single intravenous injection of 2 g spectacillin 86.20 gamma/ml - h; after intramuscular injection (twice) - interval of 12 hours - 29.94 gamma/ml - h after 12 hours; same values as before, but after 24 hours, 29.37 gamma/ml - h. after a single oral application of one capsule of spectacillin (capsule equals 500 mg), the value of the accumulated area was 8.46  gamma/ml - h. in analogy of the good absorption, excretion in urine/24 hrs (after application of 1 g spectacillin intravenously) was 61.74 p.c., after 2 g i.v. 54.30 p.c., and after applying twice 1 g spectacillin intramuscularly 61.40 p.c.; after oral application of 500 mg, the percentage was 28.42. tolerance of spectacillin was good after oral as well as after parenteral application. no side effects were observed.

AB  == three aminoglycoside antibiotics and two penicillins were compared for their in vitro activity against 60 isolates of serratia, pseudomonas, proteus mirabilis, and indole-positive proteus sp. testing was done by the agar dilution method using mueller-hinton broth solidified with 1.5% agar. the activity of amikacin, aminodeoxybutirosin, and gentamicin against proteus and pseudomonas, as related to their peak blood levels, showed no significant differences. amikacin was the most active against serratia marcescens. results using mueller-hinton media in broth dilution tests correlated with the agar dilution method except for pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal inhibitory concentration for aminoglycosides  in agar was considerably greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration in mueller-hinton broth, and the disparity was related to the higher divalent cation concentration of agar. bl-p1654 and carbenicillin were similar except that carbenicillin was much more active against indole-positive proteus sp. additionally, the ratio of bactericidal to bacteriostatic concentrations of bl-p1654 was considerably greater than for carbenicillin.

AB  == data accumulating routinely in a hospital microbiology laboratory were computer-plotted according to the number of days the patient had been in the hospital when each culture was obtained. the rate at which patients were cultured fell slightly during hospitalization, while the rate at which isolates were obtained from them increased gradually. for some species, such as escherichia coli or staphylococcus aureus, isolation rates changed little during hospitalization. they rose as much as sevenfold for other species, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or serratia marcescens, or for a particular antibiotype of klebsiella pneumoniae while it was an endemic nosocomial problem. these differences persisted after deletion of repeat isolates from the same patient. they appeared to reflect general shifts in composition of patient flora during hospitalization. these shifts paralleled shifts in infecting flora as represented by similar plots of isolates from blood cultures.

AB  == this paper reports our experience in monitoring gentamicin therapy during the treatment of 68 episodes of serious gram-negative sepsis in 65 hospital patients. most of the patients had major underlying disease. of those who were adequately treated (peak serum concentrations of 5 mug/ml or more in 72 hours for septicaemia, urinary tract infection, and wound infection; and 8 mug/ml or more at some time during the course of treatment for pneumonia) 84% (46 out of 55) were cured. these serum concentrations could be achieved only by starting with a  regimen of 5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses in all adult patients, subsequent dosage being determined by the results of rapid serum assay. the incidence of nephrotoxicity and symptomatic ototoxicity was no greater than in previous series. the main reason for assaying serum gentamicin is to ensure that an adequate dosage is achieved as soon as possible. in patients with impaired renal  function or receiving prolonged high dosage assays also serve to guard against an excessive accumulation of gentamicin and an increased risk of toxicity.

TI  == effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.

AB  == igg with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to  igg antibacterial antibody preparations. opsonic human igg obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. in vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of i(-)  and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, s. aureus, p. mirabilis, and e. coli. however, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of p. aeruginosa. bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated igg preparations. antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. these in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

AB  == modified moore's swabs, placed in sewers for 5 days, were used to concentrate salmonellas from sewage. duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were incubated at 41 and 37 degrees c. respectively. salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were incubated at 41 degrees c. however, when equal portions of the same swabs were incubated at 37 degrees c., only 22% of them yielded salmonella organisms. these results indicate an advantage in incubating the selenite broths at 41 degrees c. rather than 37 degrees c. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage.one hundred and fifty faecal samples were examined for salmonellas by culture in selenite broths incubated at 41 and 37 degrees c. twelve (8%) samples were positive at 41  degrees c. compared to only 10 (6.7%) positive samples at 37 degrees c. this difference is not statistically significant to indicate an advantage of the elevated-temperature of incubation over the conventional temperature in attempting to isolate salmonellas from human faeces. moreover, results of the recovery rates of s. paratyphi b, s. typhi, and s. typhimurium indicate that an incubation temperature of 37 degrees c. is more appropriate for recovering salmonellas from artificially infected faecal samples than an incubation temperature of 41 degrees c. this stresses the inability of laboratory studies to mimic conditions in nature.

AB  == amoxicillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin, brl 2333) is a new semisynthetic penicillin which is structurally similar to ampicillin, but which is better absorbed and yields higher concentrations in serum and urine. the in vitro susceptibility of 145 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 30 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined against various concentrations of amoxicillin and ampicillin in agar. in addition, inhibitory zones around discs containing 10 mug of amoxicillin were measured and compared with results of agar  dilution studies. the drug also was evaluated in the treatment of 38 patients with bacteriuria, who received doses of either 750 mg or 1 g/day for 10 days. in  vitro, amoxicillin was comparable in activity to ampicillin; most isolates of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 10 mug or less/ml, whereas the majority of strains of enterobacter, klebsiella, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas grew in concentrations greater than 50 mug/ml. clinically, amoxicillin was effective in eradicating bacteriuria due to susceptible organisms and was very well tolerated. for practical purposes, however, amoxicillin performed no better than a host of other drugs presently available for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated bacteriuria.

TI  == murein and the outer penetration barrier of escherichia coli k-12, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a penetration barrier operating outside the periplasmic enzyme penicillinase was  studied in an ampicillin-resistant mutant of escherichia coli k-12. growth in the presence of lysozyme and sublethal concentrations of ampicillin partially opened  the barrier. this could be recorded as an increased penetration of penicillin g,  sodium cholate, and rifampin to their respective targets. brief treatments with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium cholate effectively impaired the barrier against penicillin and also caused leakage of penicillinase. wild-type e. coli k-12, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa also showed an increased sensitivity to cholate after treatment with penicillins. electron micrographs showed that lysis by cholate was due to a distortion of the cytoplasmic membrane causing a leakage of protein and  rna from the cells to the medium. physiological data indicated that the increased sensitivity to cholate induced by growth in the presence of ampicillin or lysozyme was due to effects upon the murein. this was supported by measurement of the incorporation of (3)h-diaminopimelic acid. these results indicate that the murein sacculus either is a part of the penetration barrier or is responsible for holding the structure of the outer membrane together.

AB  == based on agglutination, complement fixation, bactericidal, and opsonization tests, it is evident that suspensions of a bacteroides sp. isolated from the mouse intestine and given by parenteral routes do not initiate antibody formation in mice. rats also respond poorly to the antigenic stimulus. in contrast, suspensions of other bacterial species isolated from the rodent intestine are highly immunogenic. furthermore, high titers of antibody are produced in rabbits, guinea pigs, and sheep after parenteral injection of the bacteroides suspensions. marked differences in the absolute and relative numbers of bacteroides in the intestinal contents of rodents and the latter three animal species have been demonstrated. it is proposed that the immunological unresponsiveness of rodents to this organism is related to its existence as a member of the autochthonous microflora in these animals.

AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  == one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin  were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.

AB  == cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. at a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. however, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas were inhibited. a 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. all penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. the drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as  well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative  culture during therapy. a single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis.  two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. the drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. no abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. in addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. if further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.

AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

AB  == the effect of mg(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin was determined against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis grown  in trypticase soy broth or defined synthetic medium. in the presence of edta, the activity of coumermycin a(1) was significantly enhanced (8- to 40-fold) against all four organisms in the synthetic medium lacking mg(2+); novobiocin activity was increased to a lesser extent (4- to 16-fold) against three strains and remained unchanged against p. mirabilis. addition of 200 mug of mg(2+) per ml to  the synthetic medium containing edta completely reversed the enhancement of activity of both antibiotics by edta only against p. aeruginosa. the addition of  mg(2+) to the synthetic medium appreciably inhibited the activity of novobiocin (sixfold) but not coumermycin a(1) against e. coli, and had little or no effect on the activity of either antibiotic against the remaining organisms. k. pneumoniae showed the greatest susceptibility to both antibiotics, and addition of edta enhanced this activity from 4-fold to 20-fold in all of the media tested. subinhibitory concentrations of both antibiotics induced filament formation by all four organisms in all media. in addition, lysis of k. pneumoniae cells was observed.

TI  == prevention of experimental hematogenous and retrograde pyelonephritis by antibodies against enterobacterial common antigen.
AB  == rabbits were immunized with common antigen (ca) derived from salmonella typhimurium. animals with ca hemagglutinin titers of 1-320 to 1-81,920 were injected with 10(7) viable proteus mirabilis via the retrograde and hematogenous  routes. nonimmune control groups were challenged similarly. from the retrogradely challenged groups sacrificed at 4 weeks, pyelonephritis was found in 89% of the control animals but not in those immunized. bacteriuria was present in 89% of the controls but in only 61% of the immunized group. hematogenously challenged, immune animals sacrificed at 6 weeks did not show histological evidence of renal  pathology, and only 6% had bacteriuria. eighty-six per cent of the nonimmune controls showed both pyelonephritis and bacteriuria. the protective effect is specific because of the following. (i) active and passive ca immunization did not prevent pyelonephritis due to pseudomonas aeruginosa which does not produce this  antigen. (ii) passive immunization with a ca antiserum conferred protection against a p. mirabilis challenge. (iii) passive administration of an antiserum from which ca antibodies had been differentially absorbed abolished the protective activity.

TI  == sensitivity of gram-negative bacilli to ampicillin after six years' clinical use.
AB  == a total of 1,102 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli was obtained from four hospitals during 1967 and these cultures were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin. approximately 80% of the strains of escherichia coli and 90% of the strains of proteus mirabilis, the two organisms most frequently isolated, were sensitive to ampicillin. klebsiella-enterobacter species and pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally insensitive. comparison of these results with data obtained in an earlier study with gram-negative organisms isolated in 1961 showed that there had been no significant increase in the incidence of resistance of gram-negative bacilli to ampicillin during the period 1961-67. the majority of ampicillin-resistant strains of e. coli isolated in 1967 transferred ampicillin resistance to a sensitive strain of e. coli k12. only four ampicillin-resistant strains of e. coli isolated in 1961 were available for transferable resistance tests but all four strains transferred ampicillin resistance. infective or transferable resistance was therefore a feature of ampicillin resistance of certain gram-negative bacteria before ampicillin became generally available for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of coumermycin a1.
AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against staphylococcus aureus. it was about 50 times more  active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. coumermycin also showed good activity against group a streptococci and pneumococci, moderate  activity against escherichia coli, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against klebsiella-enterobacter and enterococci. against p. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. the new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  == in a period of two years, 865 strains of gram-negative bacilli other than pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. the commonest species were proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and enterobacter  cloacae. many strains of klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes, and bacterium anitratum were also found.a large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. the proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different  antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. a large proportion of the strains of e. coli and p. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. multiple resistance occurred less  often among strains of e. coli than among klebsiella spp, enterobacter spp, and p. mirabilis. phage and serological typing of ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.

TI  == salmonella suppression by known populations of bacteria in flies.
AB  == survivorship of salmonella typhimurium, streptococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in dibiotic and tribiotic interactions in vitro and in various regions of the digestive tract of the blow fly, calliphora vicina. in dibiotic interactions, salmonella typhimurium dominated streptococcus faecalis and was dominated by p. mirabilis, but in neither case was it eliminated from the larval gut. in tribiotic interactions, there was synergic suppression and a definite trend toward elimination of salmonella typhimurium from the gut. this trend approaches but does not match the total exclusion of s. typhimurium from the gut of maggots with a normal flora. bacterial survival in the gut of the fly is discussed in relation to doubling time, sweep-out rate of the maggot and prepupal gut, and the midgut bactericide.

TI  == protection by vaccination against pseudomonas infection after thermal injury.
AB  == active immunization is effective in the prophylaxis of pseudomonas septicemia in  burned mice. vaccines were prepared from bacterial cells and growth medium of verder's 10 different o serological types of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, as well as from escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. mice given a tail burn could be significantly protected against a local pseudomonas challenge by both specific and, to a lesser extent, by nonspecific pseudomonas vaccines prepared either from bacterial cells or from the medium in which they were grown. the vaccine was effective when administered prior to or after thermal trauma. after a more extensive rump burn, the protective effect of a specific vaccine given after thermal injury was significant only when the challenge was postponed until 4 days postburn; the level of protection was less than in the mice with smaller burns.

TI  == occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  escherichia coli, carrying an r factor was investigated in various gram-negative  bacilli. the acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. the investigated strains were of the salmonella-arizona group, the klebsiella-aerobacter group, serratia marcescens, the proteus group, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them  was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. in the proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. only the sensitive strains  containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. all  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). all of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the klebsiella-aerobacter group and of s. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. with respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the r factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.

TI  == a new selective blood agar medium for streptococcus pyogenes and other haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == horse blood agar containing polymyxin b sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of staph. aureus, ps. pyocyanea, proteus mirabilis, e.  coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, str. pyogenes. in a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (p.n.f.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with str. pyogenes; p.n.f. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of str. pyogenes  from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. haemolytic streptococci of groups a, c, d, g, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on p.n.f. medium than on blood 4% agar. viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on p.n.f. medium. these limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

TI  == in vitro biological activity of cephalothin.
AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
