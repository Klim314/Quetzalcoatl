TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == identification of enterobacteriaceae by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the vitek ms system.
AB  == this multicenter study evaluated the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry identifications from the vitek ms system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) for enterobacteriaceae typically encountered in the clinical laboratory. enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 965) representing 17 genera and 40 species were  analyzed on the vitek ms system (database v2.0), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. colony growth (</=72 h) was applied directly to the  target slide. matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and  allowed to dry before mass spectrometry analysis. on the basis of the confidence  level, the vitek ms system provided a species, genus only, or no identification for each isolate. the accuracy of the mass spectrometric identification was compared to 16s rrna gene sequencing performed at midi labs (newark, de). supplemental phenotypic testing was performed at biomerieux when necessary. the vitek ms result agreed with the reference method identification for 96.7% of the  965 isolates tested, with 83.8% correct to the species level and 12.8% limited to a genus-level identification. there was no identification for 1.7% of the isolates. the vitek ms system misidentified 7 isolates (0.7 %) as different genera. three pantoea agglomerans isolates were misidentified as enterobacter spp. and single isolates of enterobacter cancerogenus, escherichia hermannii, hafnia alvei, and raoultella ornithinolytica were misidentified as klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, obesumbacterium proteus, and enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. eight isolates (0.8 %) were misidentified as a different species in the correct genus. the vitek ms system provides reliable mass spectrometric identifications for enterobacteriaceae.
