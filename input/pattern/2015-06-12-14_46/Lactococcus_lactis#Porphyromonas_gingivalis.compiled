TI  - Expression of Porphyromonas gingivalis gingipain antigen Hgp44 domain on surface  of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen involved in the development of chronic periodontitis, has a number of major virulence factors, among which are its surface cysteine protease gingipains. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of inducing protective antibodies against P. gingivalis by means of immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing the 44-kDa gingipain adhesion/hemagglutinin domain (Hgp44). Part of the Hgp44 sequence encoding the first 314 amino acid residues, residues 188-251, and residues 354-393 was amplified and inserted into shuttle plasmid pSGANC332, with the resulting chimeric plasmids designated as pISTY210, pCOL, and pSHGRP44A, respectively. After confirming the clone sequences, expression of recombinant proteins was investigated by immunoblot. The results revealed that while pISTY210 and pCOL both expressed the Hgp44 antigen on the surface of L. lactis, the level of expression was quite low. To enhance expression of the protein on the surface of the cells, cysteine residues were changed to serine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of 3 out of 5 cysteine residues (pISTY213) significantly increased expression of the recombinant protein on the surface of the bacteria. Interestingly, replacement of the 4th cysteine residue (pISTY215) reduced antigenicity of the recombinant protein. These results indicate that expression of Hgp44 on the surface of L. lactis cells requires the replacement of several key cysteine residues, and that L. lactis expressing this antigen could be a promising candidate for immunization against P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis.
TI  - Cell immobilization studies using a cellulose-binding domain fused to PrtP in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of XylA was fused with PrtP, NisP and AcmA anchors derived from Lactococcus lactis under P45 promoter and Usp45 secretion signal. The fusion construct with the anchor PrtP (334 aa) was shown to exhibit the most efficient immobilization. The CBD-PrtP construct on the other hand was not efficiently attached to the cell wall and as such was found mainly in the supernatant. Results also showed that expression of the CBD-NisP anchor fusion led to a similar result. This raised the question if more efficient binding of the anchor to the cell wall by sortase could enhance the efficiency of cell immobilization to the cellulosic material. However, expressing sortase with the CBD-PrtP fusion did not improve the immobilization of the cells to cellulose.
TI  - The neprilysin family in health and disease.
AB  - The mammalian neprilysin (NEP) family comprises at least seven members: NEP itself, Kell blood group antigen (KELL), the endothelin-converting enzymes (ECE-1 and ECE-2), the enzyme PEX, associated with X-linked hypophosphataemia, "X-converting enzyme" (XCE) a CNS-expressed orphan peptidase and a soluble, secreted endopeptidase (SEP). These zinc metallopeptidases are all type II integral membrane proteins. Where identified, these enzymes have roles in the processing or metabolism of regulatory peptides and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets. A distinct feature of ECE-1 species is their existence as distinct isoforms differing in their N-terminal cytoplasmic tails. These tails play a role in enzyme targeting and turnover with di-leucine and tyrosine-based motifs affecting localization. Additional anchorage of these enzymes can also occur through palmitoylation. Bacterial homologues of the neprilysin family exist, for example the products of the pepO genes from L. lactis and S. parasanguis, and a recently described gene product of P. gingivalis which is an ECE-1 homologue that can catalyse the conversion of big endothelin to endothelin. A genomics based approach to understanding the functions of this proteinase family is aided by the completion of the C. elegans and Drosophila genomes, both of which encode multiple copies of NEP-like enzymes.
TI  - Coinvasion of dentinal tubules by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii depends upon binding specificity of streptococcal antigen I/II adhesin.
AB  - Cell wall-anchored polypeptides of the antigen I/II family are produced by many species of oral streptococci. These proteins mediate adhesion of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins and to other oral microorganisms and promote binding of cells to collagen type I and invasion of dentinal tubules. Since infections of the root canal system have a mixed anaerobic bacterial etiology, we investigated the hypothesis that coadhesion of anaerobic bacteria with streptococci may facilitate invasive endodontic disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 cells were able to invade dentinal tubules when cocultured with Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) but not when cocultured with Streptococcus mutans NG8. An isogenic noninvasive mutant of S. gordonii, with production of SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family) polypeptides abrogated, was deficient in binding to collagen and had a 40% reduced ability to support adhesion of P. gingivalis. Heterologous expression of the S. mutans SpaP (antigen I/II) protein in this mutant restored collagen binding and tubule invasion but not adhesion to P. gingivalis or the ability to promote P. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. An isogenic afimbrial mutant of P. gingivalis had 50% reduced binding to S. gordonii cells but was unaffected in the ability to coinvade dentinal tubules with S. gordonii wild-type cells. Expression of the S. gordonii SspA or SspB polypeptide on the surface of Lactococcus lactis cells endowed these bacteria with the abilities to bind P. gingivalis, penetrate dentinal tubules, and promote P. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. The results demonstrate that collagen-binding and P. gingivalis-binding properties of antigen I/II polypeptides are discrete functions. Specificity of antigen I/II polypeptide recognition accounts for the ability of P. gingivalis to coinvade dentinal tubules with S. gordonii but not with S. mutans. This provides evidence that the specificity of interbacterial coadhesion may influence directly the etiology of pulpal and periapical diseases.
