TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

TI  == subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. method: thirty ibd patients [15 with crohn's disease (cd) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (uc)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. all patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. from every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees  c until analysis using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. results: multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for bacteroides ureolyticus, campylobacter gracilis, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and treponema denticola (p<0.001). cd  patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than uc patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (p<0.05). cd patients harbored higher levels of p. melaninogenica, s. aureus, s. anginosus, and s. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (p<0.05). uc patients harbored higher levels of s. aureus (p=0.01) and p. anaerobius (p=0.05)  than controls only in gingivitis sites. conclusion: our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, ibd patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival  sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == [modifying action of oxytocin on the biological properties of the causative agents of anaerobic non-clostridial infection].
AB  == in a number of in vitro experiments the effect of oxytocin on the antilysozyme and anticomplemental activity of propiobacterium propionicum, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreprtococcus anaerobius, isolated  from patients with acute pyoinflammatory pleuropulmonary diseases, was studied. antibiotic resistance dynamics of the infective agents under study to lincomycin, clindamycin, thienam, vancomycin was also detected. the inhibiting activity of oxytocin on the persistence properties of b. fragilis, p. melanogenica and p. anaerobius was noted. under the influence of the preparations used changes in the sensitivity of the strains to a number of antibiotics of the lincosamide, carbapenem and glycopeptide groups were found to occur. the data thus obtained were indicative of the possible mechanisms of action of oxytocin in the treatment of acute pyoinflammatory pleuropulmonary diseases of anaerobic nonclostridial etiology.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  == the effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. before therapy, potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated  with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. however, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella melaninogenica. fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. after therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (p< 0.001).

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an in-vitro study of the comparative viability on different swab types of simulated specimens of bacteria commonly present in oro-facial infections.
AB  == an in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of amies transport medium. standard inocula of pure cultures of streptococcus milleri, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked  on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation.  differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. recovery of prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. we conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == cytotoxicity versus antibacterial activity of some antiseptics in vitro.
AB  == through the development of new techniques for bacterial growth and isolation, obligate anaerobes have been shown to be more prevalent than previously thought in the pathogenesis of periapical and pulpal diseases. a follow-up study was conducted to examine the germicidal effect of 0.05% naocl, 10 mg/ml metronidazole and supernatant of ca (oh)2 (0.025 ml) on four anaerobic microorganisms commonly  found in root canals, and to compare the toxicity of these substances on cell cultures. in vitro testing revealed that 0.05% naocl and ca (oh)2 were both equally effective on these anaerobes. also, metronidazole was found to be germicidally effective against bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, but ineffective against veillonella alcalescens. furthermore, it was found that naocl and ca (oh)2 had a very destructive effect on cell cultures compared with their antimicrobial effect, whereas metronidazole was less toxic among the agents tested.

AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
