TI  == detection of novel oral species and phylotypes in symptomatic endodontic infections including abscesses.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of several uncultivated phylotypes and newly named bacterial species in symptomatic endodontic infections. samples taken from cases clinically diagnosed as acute periradicular  abscesses or acute periradicular periodontitis were surveyed for the presence of  12 taxa by means of a 16s rrna-gene-based nested or hemi-nested pcr assay. the most prevalent of the target taxa were dialister invisus, olsenella uli, granulicatella adiacens, and synergistes clones ba121 and e3_33. findings revealed that novel phylotypes and newly named species can take part in the microbiota associated with symptomatic endodontic infections and a pathogenetic role is suspected.

TI  == usefulness of the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna-based bacterial identification system for identification of clinically significant bacterial isolates with ambiguous biochemical profiles.
AB  == due to the inadequate automation in the amplification and sequencing procedures,  the use of 16s rrna gene sequence-based methods in clinical microbiology laboratories is largely limited to identification of strains that are difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, using conventional full-sequence 16s rrna gene sequencing as the "gold standard," we evaluated the usefulness of the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna (rdna)-based bacterial identification system, which involves amplification and sequencing of the first 527-bp fragment of the 16s rrna genes of bacterial strains and analysis of the sequences using the database of the system, for identification of clinically significant bacterial isolates with ambiguous biochemical profiles. among 37 clinically significant bacterial strains that showed ambiguous biochemical profiles, representing 37 nonduplicating aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic, and mycobacterium species, the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system was successful in identifying 30 (81.1%) of them. five (13.5%) isolates were misidentified at the genus level (granulicatella adiacens was misidentified as abiotrophia defectiva, helcococcus kunzii was misidentified  as clostridium hastiforme, olsenella uli was misidentified as atopobium rimae, leptotrichia buccalis was misidentified as fusobacterium mortiferum, and bergeyella zoohelcum was misidentified as rimerella anatipestifer), and two (5.4%) were misidentified at the species level (actinomyces odontolyticus was misidentified as actinomyces meyeri and arcobacter cryaerophilus was misidentified as arcobacter butzleri). when the same 527-bp dna sequences of these seven isolates were compared to the known 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank, five yielded the correct identity, with good discrimination between the  best and second best match sequences, meaning that the reason for misidentification in these five isolates was due to a lack of the 16s rrna gene sequences of these bacteria in the database of the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system. in conclusion, the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system is useful for identification of most clinically important bacterial strains with ambiguous biochemical profiles, but the database of the microseq 500 16s rdna-based bacterial identification system has to be expanded in order to encompass the rarely encountered bacterial species and achieve better accuracy in bacterial identification.
