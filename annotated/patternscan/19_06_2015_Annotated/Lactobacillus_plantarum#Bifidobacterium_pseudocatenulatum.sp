TI  == prebiotic effect of soluble fibres from modern and old durum-type wheat varieties on lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == background: wheat grains are a rich source of dietary fibres, particularly in the western human diet. many of the health effects attributed to dietary fibres are believed to be related to their microbial fermentation in the gut. this study evaluated the ability of two potentially probiotic strains, lactobacillus plantarum l12 and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum b7003, to ferment soluble dietary fibres (sdfs) from modern and ancient durum-type wheat grains. results: fibre microbial utilisation was highly variable and dependent on the strain. sdfs from the varieties svevo and solex supported the growth of l. plantarum l12 the best, whereas those from the varieties anco marzio, solex and kamut((r)) khorasan were good carbohydrate substrates for b. pseudocatenulatum b7003. the highest prebiotic activity scores (describing the extent to which prebiotics support selective growth of probiotics) for b7003 were obtained with sdfs from the varieties solex (0.57), kamut((r)) khorasan (0.56) and iride (0.55), whereas for  l12 the highest scores were achieved with the varieties orobel (0.63), kamut((r)) khorasan (0.56) and solex (0.53). conclusion: the present study has identified some sdfs from durum-type wheat grains as suitable prebiotic substrates for the selective proliferation of b. pseudocatenulatum b7003 and l. plantarum l12 in vitro. the results provide the basis for the potential utilisation of wheat-based prebiotics as a component of synbiotic formulations.

TI  == folate production by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, mostly belonging to the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, confer a number of health benefits to the host, including vitamin production. with the aim to produce folate-enriched fermented products and/or develop probiotic supplements that accomplish folate biosynthesis in vivo  within the colon, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have been extensively studied for their capability to produce this vitamin. on the basis of physiological studies and genome analysis, wild-type lactobacilli cannot synthesize folate, generally require it for growth, and provide a negative contribution to folate levels in fermented dairy products. lactobacillus plantarum constitutes an exception among lactobacilli, since it is capable of folate production in presence of para-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and deserves to be used in animal trials to validate its ability to produce the vitamin in vivo. on the other hand, several folate-producing strains have been selected within the genus bifidobacterium, with a great variability in the extent of vitamin released in the medium. most of them belong to the species b. adolescentis and b. pseudocatenulatum, but few folate producing strains are found in the other species as well. rats fed a probiotic formulation of folate-producing bifidobacteria exhibited increased plasma folate level, confirming that the vitamin is produced in vivo and absorbed. in a human trial, the same supplement raised folate concentration in feces. the use of folate-producing probiotic strains can be regarded as a new perspective in the specific use of probiotics. they could more efficiently confer protection against inflammation and cancer, both exerting the beneficial effects of probiotics and preventing the folate deficiency that is associated with premalignant changes in the colonic epithelia.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.
