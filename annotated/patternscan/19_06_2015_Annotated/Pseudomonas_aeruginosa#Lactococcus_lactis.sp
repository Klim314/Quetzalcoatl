TI  == phosphoketolases from lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pseudomonas aeruginosa: dissimilar sequences, similar substrates but distinct enzymatic characteristics.
AB  == phosphoketolases (pks) are large thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp)-dependent enzymes playing key roles in a number of essential pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. the putative pk genes of lactococcus lactis (ll) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (lm) were cloned in a prokaryotic vector, and the encoded proteins were expressed and purified yielding high purity proteins termed pk-ll and pk-lm, respectively.  similarly, the pk gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa was expressed, and the corresponding protein (pk-pa) was purified to homogeneity. the amino acid sequences predicted on the basis of genes' nucleotide sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometry and display low relative similarities. circular dichroism (cd)  spectra of these proteins predict higher alpha-helix than beta-strand contents. in addition, it is predicted that pk-ll contains tightly packed domains. enzymatic analysis showed that all three recombinant proteins, despite their dissimilar amino acid sequences, are active pks and accept both xylulose 5-phosphate (x5p) and fructose 6-phosphate (f6p) as substrates. however, they display substantially higher preference for x5p than for f6p. kinetic measurements indicated that pk-pa has the lowest km values for x5p and f6p suggesting the highest capacity for substrate binding. pk-ll has the largest kcat values for both substrates. nevertheless, in terms of substrate specificity constant, pk-pa has been found to be the most active pk against x5p. structural models for all three analysed pks predict similar folds in spite of amino acid sequence dissimilarities and contribute to understanding the enzymatic peculiarities of pk-pa compared to pk-ll and pk-lm.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == a new pentacyclic triterpene with potent antibacterial activity from limnophila indica linn. (druce).
AB  == a new pentacyclic triterpenoid constituent, characterized as 3-oxo-olean-12(13),18(19)-dien-29alpha-carboxylic acid (1) on the basis of detailed spectral studies, was isolated from the aerial parts and roots of limnophila indica (scrophulariaceae). compound 1 exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz. bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes (mics within a range of 25-30 mug/ml) and moderate activity against four gram-negative bacteria salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pantoea ananatis (mics within a range of 30-100 mug/ml). the plant pathogenic bacterium p. ananatis and human pathogenic s. typhimurium responded at comparatively higher concentrations of the compound 1, which were 75 and 100 mug/ml respectively. the  compound inhibited the growth of gram-positive b. subtilis and gram-negative p. aeruginosa completely with a clear bactericidal mode of action at their mic values. the compound upon treatment on both b. subtilis and p. aeruginosa released substantial amount of nucleic acid in the external medium and also effected the change of morphology towards pleomorphicity, thereby indicating its  probable action on cell membrane. furthermore, the triterpenoid 1 was found not to inhibit a probiotic lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis labw4 under in vitro condition and to possess no toxicity in swiss albino mice.

TI  == design and construction of a single tube, quantitative endpoint, late-pcr multiplex assay for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to develop a molecular diagnostic multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of microbial pathogens commonly responsible  for ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and their antibiotic resistance using linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr). method and results: this multiplex assay was designed for the quantitative detection and identification of pathogen genomic dna of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus a control target from lactococcus lactis. after amplification, the single-stranded amplicons were detected simultaneously in the same closed tube by hybridization to low-temperature molecular beacon probes labelled with four differently coloured fluorophores. the resulting hybrids were then analysed by determining the fluorescence intensity of each of the four fluorophores as a function of temperature. conclusions: this late-pcr single tube multiplex assay generated endpoint fluorescent contours that allowed identification of all microbial pathogens commonly responsible for vap, including mrsa. the assay was quantitative, identifying the pathogens present in the sample, no matter whether  there were as few as 10 or as many 100 000 target genomes. significance and impact of the study: this assay is rapid, reliable and sensitive and is ready for preclinical testing using samples recovered from patients suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == design of a single-tube, endpoint, linear-after-the-exponential-pcr assay for 17  pathogens associated with sepsis.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to construct a single-tube multiplex molecular diagnostic assay using linear-after-the-exponential (late)-pcr for the detection  of 17 microbial pathogens commonly associated with septicaemia. methods and results: the assay described here detects 17 pathogens associated with sepsis via amplification and analysis of gene-specific sequences. the pathogens and their targeted genes were: klebsiella spp. (phoe); acinetobacter baumannii (gyrb); staphylococcus aureus (spa); enterobacter spp. (thdf); pseudomonas aeruginosa (toxa); coagulase-negative staphylococci (tuf), enterococcus spp. (tuf); candida  spp. (p450). a sequence from an unidentified gene in lactococcus lactis, served as a positive control for assay function. late-pcr was used to generate single-stranded amplicons that were analysed at endpoint over a wide range of temperatures in four fluorescent colours. each target was detected by its pattern of hybridization to a sequence-specific low-temperature fluorescent probe derived from molecular beacons. conclusions: all 17 microbial targets were detected in samples containing low numbers of pathogen genomes in the presence of high levels of human genomic dna. significance and impact of the study: this assay used new technology to achieve an advance in the field of molecular diagnostics: a single-tube assay for detection of pathogens commonly responsible for septicaemia.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of gallidermin-siderophore conjugates.
AB  == the lantibiotic gallidermin was modified at lysine residues by regioselective attachment of derivatives of pyochelin, agrobactin and desferrioxamine b with the objective of having siderophore receptors of gram-negative bacteria transport the antibiotic-iron chelator conjugate through the outer membrane. all of the conjugates retained activity against the gram-positive indicator strain, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris hp. however, testing of the conjugates against several gram-negative strains yielded unexpected results. bacteria treated with 100 mum of the conjugates complexed with fe(3+) grew better than bacteria grown in iron-free media but worse than bacteria grown in the same media supplemented with 10 mum fecl(3). although these findings indicate that the conjugates are unable to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria, they indicate penetration of the outer membrane and provide structure-activity information for design of other lantibiotic conjugates. the synthetic strategy is applicable for linking biomarkers or fluorescence probes to gallidermin for studies on its localization  and mode of action. as there are many lantibiotics that operate with unknown mechanisms of action, this chemical approach provides a means to modify such peptides with biomarkers for biological investigations.

TI  == antimicrobial mechanism of action of transferrins: selective inhibition of h+-atpase.
AB  == two bacterial species with different metabolic features, namely, pseudomonas aeruginosa and lactococcus lactis, were used as a comparative experimental model  to investigate the antimicrobial target and mechanism of transferrins. in anaerobiosis, p. aeruginosa cells were not susceptible to lactoferrin (hlf) or transferrin (htf). in aerobiosis, the cells were susceptible but o(2) consumption was not modified, indicating that components of the electron transport chain (etc) were not targeted. however, the respiratory chain inhibitor piericidin a significantly reduced the killing activity of both proteins. moreover, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (dcip), a reducing agent that accepts electrons from the etc coupled to h(+) extrusion, made p. aeruginosa susceptible to hlf and htf  in anaerobiosis. these results indicated that active cooperation of the cell was  indispensable for the antimicrobial effect. for l. lactis cells lacking an etc, the absence of a detectable transmembrane electrical potential in hlf-treated cells suggested a loss of h(+)-atpase activity. furthermore, the inhibition of atpase activity and h(+) translocation (inverted membrane vesicles) provided direct evidence of the ability of hlf to inhibit h(+)-atpase in l. lactis. based  on these data, we propose that hlf and htf also inhibit the h(+)-atpase of respiring p. aeruginosa cells. such inhibition thereby interferes with reentry of h(+) from the periplasmic space to the cytoplasm, resulting in perturbation of intracellular ph and the transmembrane proton gradient. consistent with this hypothesis, periplasmic h(+) accumulation was prevented by anaerobiosis or by piericidin a or was induced by dcip in anaerobiosis. collectively, these results  indicate that transferrins target h(+)-atpase and interfere with h(+) translocation, yielding a lethal effect in vitro.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == cross-generational fitness effects of infection in drosophila melanogaster.
AB  == activation of the immune system is beneficial in defending against pathogens, but may also have costly side effects on an organism's fitness. in this study we examine the fitness consequences of immune challenge in female drosophila melanogaster by examining both direct (within generation) and indirect (between generations) costs and benefits of immune challenge. though passing immunity to offspring has been studied in mammals for many years, only recently have researchers found evidence for a cross-generational priming response in invertebrates. by examining both potential fitness costs and benefits in the next generation, we were able to determine what effect immune challenge has on fitness. in agreement with other studies, we found a direct cost to infection, where immune challenged females laid fewer eggs than unchallenged females in two  of the three lines we examined. in addition, we found some evidence for indirect  costs. offspring from immune challenged mothers had shorter lifespans than those  from unchallenged mothers in two of the three lines. interestingly, we do not see any effect of maternal immune challenge on offspring's ability to overcome an infection, nor do we see an effect on other fitness traits measured, including egg size, egg-adult viability and offspring resistance to oxidative stress. while previous studies in bumblebees and beetles have demonstrated cross-generation priming, our results suggest that it may not be a general phenomenon, and more work is needed to determine how widespread it is.

TI  == host ecology shapes geographical variation for resistance to bacterial infection  in drosophila melanogaster.
AB  == 1. geographically distinct host populations often experience very different ecological conditions. these variable ecological conditions impact the strength of selection that these hosts experience from their parasites. 2. numerous studies have characterized geographical patterns of resistance to infection among natural populations in the context of host-parasite local adaptation, but what other factors might contribute to these differences? 3. here, we determined whether 20 naturally isolated populations of drosophila melanogaster collected along the east coast of the united states varied for survival after being inoculated with one of two species of bacteria--lactococcus lactis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we then asked whether host environment accounted for the  observed patterns of resistance. 4. resistance to both types of infection varied  spatially. the hosts' natural environment was predictive of the observed spatial  variation in resistance to l. lactis, but not p. aeruginosa, infection. specifically, hosts exposed to species-rich bacterial communities were more likely to survive the infection. 5. we conclude that biotic characteristics of the host environment, specifically the number of species of bacteria hosts encounter, shape host resistance to bacterial infection in nature. we discuss our results in the context of what is known about the evolutionary ecology of resistance in invertebrate systems.

TI  == bioprotection of golden delicious apples and iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16s rdna sequencing and api 50ch. most of them pertained to leuconostoc spp. and lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to weissella spp. and lactococcus lactis. growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded golden delicious apples  and iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. the strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced  the cell count of s. typhimurium and e .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of l. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. results support  the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == [construction of food-grade inducible expression system in lactococcus lactis and expression of fusion oprf/h from pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  == the food-grade inducible gene expression system in l. lactis was constructed for  expression of cytoplasmic and anchored heterologous proteins. gene alpha-aga encoding alpha-galactosidase was used as food-grade selectable marker instead of  antibiotic resistance gene. firstly, a food-grade cytoplasmic inducible expression vector prna48 containing alpha-aga, theta replicon from praf800, and pnisa-mcs-tpepn from pnz8048 was constructed. then the cell wall anchored expression vector prnv48 containing alpha-aga, theta replicon, and pnisa-spusp45-nuca-cwam6-tlt2 was constructed based on the plasmids prna48 and pve5524, which was suitable for the heterologous proteins anchored to the cell wall of l. lactis nz9000. the fusion oprf/h derived from pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned into plasmids prna48 and prnv48 to construct the prna48-oprf/h and 3rnv48-oprf/h for the expression of oprf/h. oprf/h was produced by the recombinant strains when induced with nisin. the highest yield of active oprf/h was 9.6% of intracellular soluble protein and 9.8% of cell wall anchored protein  in l. lactis nz9000, respectively. the immunogenicity and specificity of the expressed protein from recombinant were tested by animal immunization and western blot.

TI  == influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis st34br, a strain isolated from barley beer.

TI  == effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  == the ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate e. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. the effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of e. coli in broth medium showed that only edta and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of e. coli by nisin. in a broth where l. lactis ncfb 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 iu/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate e. coli. under the same conditions, addition of edta led to inactivation of e. coli at neutral and slightly acidic ph only. a cocktail of strains of e. coli was less sensitive than e. coli atcc 25922 alone. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant.  edta also caused a slight reduction in the l. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards ph drop and acid production. some of the inhibition of e. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. failure to observe  any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural ph (4.0) was ascribed to the  poor chelating power of edta under acid conditions.

TI  == antitermination of transcription of catabolic operons.
AB  == antitermination of transcription mediated by proteins interacting with mrna sequences is described for nine operons/regulons. eight of the systems are catabolic, while the ninth, the klebsiella pneumoniae nas regulon, is involved in the assimilation of nitrate and nitrite. six of the catabolic operons/regulons are found in bacillus subtilis, one is found in escherichia coli, and one in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antitermination system of five of the operons/regulons (e. coli blg, and sacpa, sacb, bgl, and lic from b. subtilis) are assigned to the bgl-sac family on the basis of extensive similarities with regard to antiterminator proteins and the sequences of the antiterminators. other members of the bgl-sac family are the arb operon of erwinia chrysanthemi and a presumed bgl operon of lactococcus lactis. the antitermination systems of the other four operons/regulons (b. subtilis glp, b. subtilis hut, p. aeruginosa ami, and k. pneumoniae nas) seem to be unrelated both to the bgl-sac family and to each other. the antiterminator protein of the b. subtilis glp regulon has been found not only to cause antitermination but also to stabilize the resultant mrna  and to mediate glucose repression. if other antiterminator proteins, and antitermination factors, also prove to have additional functions, it will broaden the impact of antitermination as a means of controlling gene expression.

TI  == bactericidal properties of hydrogen peroxide and copper or iron-containing complex ions in relation to leukocyte function.
AB  == various combinations of hydrogen peroxide, reductant (ascorbic acid and superoxide ion), and copper or iron salts and their coordination complexes were examined to determine their cytotoxicity toward several bacteria with diverse metabolic capabilities and cell envelope structures. four sets of bactericidal conditions were identified, comprising: (1) high concentration levels (5-100 mm)  of h2o2 in the absence of exogenous metal ions and reductant; (2) ferrous or ferric coordination complexes plus enzymatically generated o2.- and h2o2 at relatively low steady-state concentration levels; (3) cupric ion plus low concentration levels of h2o2 (1 microm-1 mm) and ascorbate (10 microm-4 mm); (4)  cuprous ion (or cupric ion plus ascorbate) in the absence of o2 and h2o2. rates of losses in viabilities increased proportionately with increases in the concentration of h2o2 in metal-free environments and with each of the components  in the cu2+/ascorbate/h2o2 bactericidal assay system. oxidant levels required for equivalent killing increased with increasing cell densities of the bacterial suspensions over the range investigated (2 x 10(7)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml). other experimental conditions or other combinations of reagents, most notably fe3+/ascorbate/h2o2 systems, did not generate bactericidal environments. the patterns of response of the three organisms tested, streptococcus lactis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were similar, suggesting common bactericidal mechanisms. however, preliminary evidence suggests that the lethal lesions caused by the various bactericidal conditions are distinct: as discussed, each of the four bactericidal conditions could conceivably be attained within the phagosomes of leukocytes, although none has as yet been identified.

AB  == rates of radiolytic inactivation of bacteria suspended in n2o-saturated solutions were dramatically increased over normal background levels when the media contained chloride or bicarbonate ions. the bacteria could be protected from this enhanced toxicity by the addition of free radical scavengers (ethanol, ascorbate, hydrogen peroxide, mannitol, glucose, edta, picolinic acid), indicating that the  lethal reactions were extracellular in origin. prior irradiation of chloride-containing solutions led to formation of hypochlorous acid, which was identified by detection of ring-chlorinated products when reacted with fluorescein. prolonged irradiation of other solutions did not lead to accumulation of bactericidal agents; however, irradiation of bicarbonate-containing solutions in the presence of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline n-oxide (dmpo) led to formation of the epr-detectable dmpo.co3- adduct. the results are interpreted in terms of formation of secondary  radicals, among which the carbonate and chlorine radicals are uniquely toxic to bacteria. from rate comparisons of the solution components, it was concluded that the reactions involving chloride ion are unlikely to be expressed in biological environments, but that the co3- radical could be an important intermediary oxidant in peroxide-inflicted cellular damage, particularly in spatially confined environments such as the leukocyte phagosome.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == acidic phospholipids are required during solubilization of amino acid transport systems of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the branched-chain amino acid transport system of lactococcus lactis was solubilized with n-octyl beta-d-gluco-pyranoside and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. transport activity was recovered only when solubilization was performed in the presence of acidic phospholipids. omission of acidic phospholipids during solubilization resulted in an inactive transport protein and the activity could not be restored in the reconstitution step. similar results have been obtained for the arginine/ornithine exchange protein from pseudomonas aeruginosa and l. lactis. functional reconstitution of the transport protein requires the presence of aminophospholipids or glycolipids in the liposomes (driessen, a.j.m., zheng, t., in't veld, g., op den kamp, j.a.f. and konings, w.n. (1988) biochemistry 27, 865-872). we propose that during the detergent solubilization the acidic phospholipids protect the transport systems against denaturation by preventing delipidation.

TI  == bacterial interactions with chromate.
AB  == hexavalent chromium compounds (chromates and dichromates) are highly toxic and are considered as mutagens and carcinogens. these compounds are discharged frequently to the environment as a result of diverse industrial processes. some microorganisms are able to reduce hexavalent chromium to the less toxic trivalent form. chromate pollution has promoted the selection of bacterial strains possessing chromate resistance determinants, usually carried by plasmids. strains combining both abilities, i.e. resistance to and reduction of chromate, are potentially useful for detoxifying chromate polluted waste waters.

TI  == general mechanism for the bacterial toxicity of hypochlorous acid: abolition of atp production.
AB  == the adenylate energy charges (ec) of escherichia coli 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, and streptococcus lactis 7962 rapidly fell in nutrient-rich media from values in excess of 0.9 to below 0.1 when the organisms were exposed to lethal levels of hocl. the same cells maintained in energy-depleted states were incapable of attaining normal ec values necessary for biosynthesis and growth when challenged with nutrient energy sources after hocl exposure. these changes correlated quantitatively with loss of replicative capabilities. initial  rates of transport of glucose, succinate, and various amino acids that act as respiratory substrates and the atp hydrolase activity of the f1 complex from the  atp synthase of e. coli 25922 also declined in parallel with or preceded loss of  viability. these results establish that cellular death is accompanied by complete disruption of bacterial atp production by both oxidative and fermentative pathways as a consequence of inhibition of inner membrane bound systems responsible for these processes.

TI  == product of the lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  == malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when l-malate is present in the medium. the activation of  the malolactic system in lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mler.  induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mler. the mler gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. the amino acid sequence of the predicted mler gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: lysr, ilvy gene products of escherichia coli, metr, cysb of salmonella typhimurium, ampr of  enterobacter cloacae, nodd of rhizobium sp., and trpi of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == viability and metabolic capability are maintained by escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus lactis at very low adenylate energy charge.
AB  == metabolic regulation by nucleotides has been examined in several bacteria within  the context of the adenylate energy charge (ec) concept. the ecs of bacteria capable of only fermentative metabolism (streptococcus lactis and the atpase-less mutant escherichia coli an718) fell to less than 0.2 under carbon-limiting conditions, but the bacteria were able to step up the ec to greater than 0.8 upon exposure to nutrient sugars. similarly, nongrowing e. coli 25922, whose ec had been artificially lowered to less than 0.1 by the addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp), was able to immediately step up  the ec to 0.8 to 0.9 upon the addition of glucose but was unable to respond to respiratory substrates. the ec of respiring bacteria (e. coli 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853) fell to 0.3 to 0.4 under certain limiting growth conditions, but the bacteria also responded immediately when challenged with succinate to give ec values greater than 0.8. these bacteria could not step up the ec with respiratory substrates in the presence of cccp. for all bacteria, the loss of the ability to step up the ec was attributable to the loss of nutrient transport function. mixtures of viable and hocl-killed e. coli 25922 were able to step up the ec in proportion to the fraction of surviving cells. the data indicate that nucleotide phosphorylation levels are not regulatory in nongrowing  bacteria but that the ec step-up achievable upon nutrient addition may be an accurate index of viability.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
