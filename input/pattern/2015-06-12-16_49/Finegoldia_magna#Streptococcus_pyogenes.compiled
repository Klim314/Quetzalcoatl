TI  - An in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  - Preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (SA) and silver carboxymethylcellulose (SCM) dressings. An- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI) as- says. Antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (CLSM). Log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for Staphylococcus aureus NCIMB 9518, Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Finegoldia magna NCTC 11804T, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662. Log10 reduction was higher for SCM than SA dressing-exposed Escherichia coli (P = 0.035) and P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 (P = 0.032), and lower for SCM than SA dressing-exposed Streptococcus pyogenes (P = 0.007), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (P = 0.045), and S. aureus NCTC 8325 (P = 0.012). Both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the CZOI assay. SA dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer than SCM activity when exposed to C. albicans (9 days' activity), E. coli (7 days' activity), F. magna (5 days' activity), and P. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the SMC exhibited greater persistence against S. pyogenes (13 days' activity). CLSM showed complete kill of S. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. The results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. The in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.
TI  - Constitutive and inflammation-dependent antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelium are differentially processed and inactivated by the commensal Finegoldia magna and the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Epithelial linings serve as physical barriers and produce antimicrobial peptides  (AMPs) to maintain host integrity. Examples are the bactericidal proteins midkine (MK) and BRAK/CXCL14 that are constitutively produced in the skin epidermal layer, where the anaerobic Gram-positive coccoid commensal Finegoldia magna resides. Consequently, this bacterium is likely to encounter both MK and BRAK/CXCL14, making these molecules possible threats to its habitat. In this study, we show that MK expression is upregulated during inflammation, concomitant with a strong downregulation of BRAK/CXCL14, resulting in changed antibacterial conditions. MK, BRAK/CXCL14, and the inflammation-dependent antimicrobial beta-defensins human beta-defensin (hBD)-2 and hBD-3 all showed bactericidal activity against both F. magna and the virulent pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes at similar concentrations. SufA, a released protease of F. magna, degraded MK and BRAK/CXCL14 but not hBD-2 nor hBD-3. Cleavage was seen at lysine and arginine residues, amino acids characteristic of AMPs. Intermediate SufA-degraded fragments of MK and BRAK/CXCL14 showed stronger bactericidal activity against S. pyogenes than F. magna, thus promoting survival of the latter. In contrast, the cysteine-protease SpeB of S. pyogenes rapidly degraded all AMPs investigated. The proteins FAF and SIC, released by F. magna and S. pyogenes, respectively, neutralized the antibacterial activity of MK and BRAK/CXCL14, protein FAF being the most efficient. Quantitation and colocalization by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated significant levels and interactions of the molecules in in vivo and ex vivo samples. The findings reflect strategies used by a permanently residing commensal and a virulent pathogen, the latter operating during the limited time course of invasive disease.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of a serotype 11A, ST62 Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We sequenced the genome of a serotype 11A, ST62 S. pneumoniae invasive isolate (AP200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(TR) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. RESULTS: The genome sequence of S. pneumoniae AP200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. The genome carries 2216 coding sequences (CDS), 56 tRNA, and 12 rRNA genes. Of the CDSs, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. AP200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11A, it contains an 11D capsular locus. Chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and horizontal gene transfer events were observed. The chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(TR)-carrying Tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phiSpn_200. Tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 ORFs. Comparative analysis of Tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as Streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species Finegoldia magna, Anaerococcus prevotii and Clostridium difficile. The genome of phiSpn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 ORFs grouped into five functional modules. Prophages similar to phiSpn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phiSpn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the Siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of S. pneumoniae AP200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. The overall diversity of AP200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements Tn1806 and phiSpn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic elements of different bacterial species. These genetic elements likely provide AP200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.
TI  - Bacterial surface protein L binds and inactivates neutrophil proteins S100A8/A9.
AB  - Finegoldia magna is an anaerobic bacterial species that is part of the normal human flora on all nonsterile body surfaces, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of infections. Some isolates of F. magna that are more frequently associated with clinical infection express protein L, a surface protein containing multiple homologous domains (B1-B5) that bind Igs through interactions with Ig L chains. The present study shows that the N-terminal A domain of protein L binds S100A8/A9, antibacterial proteins present in large amounts in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, but also extracellularly in tissues during inflammation. As a result, protein L-expressing F. magna are protected against killing by S100A8/A9. Igs and S100A8/A9 were found to interact independently with protein L, demonstrating that this bacterial surface protein is capable of manipulating both adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms.
TI  - SufA of the opportunistic pathogen finegoldia magna modulates actions of the antibacterial chemokine MIG/CXCL9, promoting bacterial survival during epithelial inflammation.
AB  - The anaerobic bacterium Finegoldia magna is part of the human commensal microbiota, but is also an important opportunistic pathogen. This bacterium expresses a subtilisin-like serine proteinase, SufA, which partially degrade the antibacterial chemokine MIG/CXCL9. Here, we show that MIG/CXCL9 is produced by human keratinocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli. In contrast to the virulent human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, the presence of F. magna had no enhancing effect on the MIG/CXCL9 expression by keratinocytes, suggesting poor detection of the latter by pathogen-recognition receptors. When MIG/CXCL9 was exposed to SufA-expressing F. magna, the molecule was processed into several smaller fragments. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed that SufA cleaves MIG/CXCL9 at several sites in the COOH-terminal region of the molecule. At equimolar concentrations, SufA-generated MIG/CXCL9 fragments were not bactericidal against F. magna, but retained their ability to kill S. pyogenes. Moreover, the SufA-generated MIG/CXCL9 fragments were capable of activating the angiostasis-mediating CXCR3 receptor, which is expressed on endothelial cells, in an order of magnitude similar to that of intact MIG/CXCL9. F. magna expresses a surface protein called FAF that is released from the bacterial surface by SufA. Soluble FAF was found to bind and inactivate the antibacterial activity of MIG/CXCL9, thereby further potentially promoting the survival of F. magna. The findings suggest that SufA modulation of the inflammatory response could be a mechanism playing an important role in creating an ecologic niche for F. magna, decreasing antibacterial activity and suppressing angiogenesis, thus providing advantage in survival for this anaerobic opportunist compared with competing pathogens during inflammation.
