TI  == the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrph product, an envelope protein required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response in plants.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains a 25-kb cluster of hrp genes that are required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco. tnphoa mutagenesis of cosmid phir11, which contains the hrp cluster, revealed two genes encoding exported or inner-membrane-spanning proteins (h.-c. huang, s. w. hutcheson, and a. collmer, mol. plant-microbe interact. 4:469-476, 1991). the gene in complementation group x, designated hrph, was subcloned on a 3.1-kb sali  fragment into pcpp30, a broad-host-range, mobilizable vector. the subclone restored the ability of hrph mutant p. syringae pv. syringae 61-2089 to elicit the hr in tobacco. dna sequence analysis of the 3.1-kb sali fragment revealed a single open reading frame encoding an 81,956-da preprotein with a typical amino-terminal signal peptide and no likely inner-membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions. hrph was expressed in the presence of [35s]methionine by using the t7 rna polymerase-promoter system and vector pt7-3 in escherichia coli and was shown to encode a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 83,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the hrph protein in e. coli was located in the membrane fraction and was absent from the periplasm and cytoplasm. the hrph protein possessed similarity with several outer membrane proteins that are known  to be involved in protein or phage secretion, including the klebsiella oxytoca puld protein, the yersinia enterocolitica yscc protein, and the piv protein of filamentous coliphages. all of these proteins possess a possible secretion motif, gg(x)12vp(l/f)lxxipxigxl(f/l), near the carboxyl terminus, and they lack a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine, in contrast to other outer membrane proteins with no known secretion function. these results suggest that the p. syringae pv.  syringae hrph protein is involved in the secretion of a proteinaceous hr elicitor.
