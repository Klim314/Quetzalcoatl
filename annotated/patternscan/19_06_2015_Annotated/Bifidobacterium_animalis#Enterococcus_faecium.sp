TI  == selenite-stress selected mutant strains of probiotic bacteria for se source production.
AB  == selenium deficiency is a major health problem worldwide for about 1 billion people. bacterial cells usually possess low tolerance to selenite stress and also low ability to reduce high concentrations of toxic selenite. here, high tolerance to selenite and selenium bioaccumulation capability were developed in mutated clones of probiotic and starter bacteria including enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis by food-level strain development process and clone selection. all mutant clones possessed increased glutathione concentration and glutathione reductase activity. the selenite treatment increased further these values in l. casei mutant strain pointing at a different selenite reduction pathway and/or stress response in this organism. considerable conversion of selenite to cell bound selenium forms with a concomitant high biomass production was detected in e. faecium and b. animalis ssp. lactis cultures. possible application of these strains as food and feed supplements is under investigation.

TI  == assessment of probiotics supplementation via feed or water on the growth performance, intestinal morphology and microflora of chickens after experimental  infection with eimeria acervulina, eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella.
AB  == in this study, the effect of probiotic supplementation via drinking water or feed on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with sporulated oocysts of eimeria acervulina (5 x 10(4)), eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella (2  x 10(4) each one) at 14 days of age was evaluated. two hundred and forty 1-day-old ross 308 male chicks were separated into eight equal groups with three  replicates. two of the groups, one infected with mixed eimeria oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls. the remaining groups were also challenged with mixed eimeria species and received the basal diet and either water supplemented with probiotic (three groups) or probiotic via feed (two groups); the probiotic used consisted of enterococcus faecium #589, bifidobacterium animalis #503 and lactobacillus salivarius #505 at a ratio of 6:3:1. probiotic supplementation was applied either via drinking water in different inclusion rates (groups w1, w2 and w3) or via feed using uncoated (group fn) or coated strains (group fc). the last group was given the basal diet  supplemented with the anticoccidial lasalocid at 75 mg/kg. each experimental group was given the corresponding diet or drinking water from day 1 to day 42 of  age. throughout the experimental period of 42 days, body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly and feed conversion ratios were calculated. seven days after infection, the infected control group presented the lowest weight gain values, while probiotics supplied via feed supported growth to a comparable level with that of the lasalocid group. probiotic groups presented lesion score values and oocyst numbers that were lower than in control infected birds but higher than in  the lasalocid group. in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, the highest villous height values were presented by probiotic groups. in conclusion, a mixture of probiotic substances gave considerable improvement in both growth performance and intestinal health in comparison with infected control birds and fairly similar improvement to an approved anticoccidial during a mixed eimeria infection.

TI  == metabolites of lactobacillus plantarum 2142 prevent oxidative stress-induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in ipec-j2 cell line.
AB  == probiotics have already proven beneficial effects in the treatment of several intestinal infections, but the underlying mechanisms how the probiotics can affect responses of porcine ipec-j2 enterocytes to oxidative stress remained to be elucidated. the immunomodulatory effect of five bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum 2142, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, bacillus amyloliquefaciens cect 5940 and enterococcus faecium cect 4515) on 1 mm peroxide-triggered upregulation of interleukin (il)-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) level was screened by q rt-pcr. our data revealed that spent culture supernatant (scs) of l. plantarum 2142 had significant lowering effect on il-8 and tnf-alpha level with concomitant promoting activity on protective hsp70 gene expression. according to  our results, lactic acid (racemic, d: - and l: -lactic acid) and acetic acid produced by lactobacilli had no protective effect in quenching upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. furthermore, l. plantarum 2142-specific supernatant peptides were detected by gel electrophoresis and capillary zone electrophoresis.

TI  == assessment of dietary supplementation with probiotics on performance, intestinal  morphology and microflora of chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == we evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with different preparations of probiotics on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with 2 x 10(4) sporulated oocysts of eimeria tenella at 14 days of age. three hundred, day-old, cobb-500 chicks, as hatched, were separated into 10 equal groups with three replicates. two of the groups, one challenged with e. tenella oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls without medication. the other challenged groups were given the anticoccidial lasalocid (60 mg/kg) or  enterococcus faecium (5 x 10(8) or 5 x 10(9)cfu/kg feed), bifidobacterium animalis (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), lactobacillus reuteri (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), bacillus subtilis (5 x 10(8)cfu/kg feed), or a multi-species probiotic mix at 5 x 10(8) or 5 x 10(9)cfu/kg feed, respectively. the trial lasted 6 weeks. individual body weight, feed intake per pen and feed conversion ratio values were recorded weekly, along with the extent of bloody diarrhea, excreta oocyst numbers and bird mortality. caecal lesions were assessed and intestinal samples were taken for histopathological and bacteriological evaluation from ileum and caecum. overall growth performance of chickens fed the multi-species probiotic mix at both levels was higher (p<0.05) compared to the infected control. overall oocyst shedding was lowest (p<0.05) in the lasalocid supplemented group. villous height was higher (p<0.05) in bacillus supplemented groups compared to infected controls. the lactobacillus supplemented group had the highest (p<0.05) numbers of both lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in ileum and caecum. in conclusion, dietary probiotics are promising for further investigation on improving intestinal health and growth performance of broiler chickens experimentally challenged with e. tenella.

TI  == bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 protects against pathogen-induced nf-kappab activation in vivo.
AB  == background: bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the early and important colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract and are generally considered to be part  of a normal, healthy microbiota. it is believed that specific strains within the  microbiota can influence host immune-reactivity and may play a role in protection from infection and aberrant inflammatory activity. one such strain, bifidobacterium animalis ahc7, has been previously shown to protect against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice and helps resolve acute idiopathic diarrhea in dogs. the aim of this study was to investigate the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the bifidobacterium animalis ahc7  protective effect. results: following 4 hours of infection with salmonella typhimurium, nf-kappab activation was significantly elevated in vivo in placebo and enterococcus faecium-fed animals while bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 consumption significantly attenuated the nf-kappab response. in vitro anti-cd3/cd28 stimulated peyer's patch cells secreted significantly less tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma following bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 consumption. stimulated cells released more il-12p70 but this difference did not reach statistical significance. no alteration in mucosal il-6, il-10 or mcp-1 levels were observed. no statistically significant change in the cytokine profile of mesenteric lymph node cells was noted. in vitro, bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 was bound by dendritic cells and induced secretion of both il-10 and il-12p70. in addition, co-culture of cd4+ t cells with bifidobacterium animalis ahc7-stimulated dendritic cells resulted in a significant increase in cd25+foxp3+ t cell numbers. conclusion: bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via the attenuation of pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation in response to an infectious insult associated with modulation  of pro-inflammatory cytokine production within the mucosa. the cellular mechanism underpinning bifidobacterium animalis ahc7 mediated attenuation of nf-kappab activation may include recognition of the bacterium by dendritic cells and induction of cd25+foxp3+ t cells.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

TI  == synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  == thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. the organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococcus faecium. folate was synthesised by s. thermophilus, bifidobacteria,  and e. faecium. s. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). generally,  lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was  additive. fermentations using a combination of bifidobacterium animalis and s. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low  in terms of recommended daily allowance.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
