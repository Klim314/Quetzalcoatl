TI  - Effects of heat-inactivated Bifidobacterium BB12 on cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since some probiotic bacteria are cariogenic themselves, their suitability for caries management is questionable. Inactivated bacteria or their supernatants have been found to exert probiotic effects, whilst having several advantages compared with living bacteria. We hypothesized that viable and heat-inactivated Bifidobacterium animalis BB12 reduces the cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans (SM) in vitro. DESIGN: We assessed mono- and mixed species biofilms of SM and viable or heat-inactivated BB12. Biofilms were grown in a continuous-culture-system under cariogenic conditions on smooth proximal enamel or cavitated dentine. For each of eight experimental subsets (4 biofilmsx2 hard-tissue conditions), a total of 32 specimens was used. After 10 days, bacterial numbers of 12 biofilms per group were analysed, and all specimens submitted to transversal microradiography. RESULTS: Mineral loss was higher in cavitated dentine than smooth enamel for all biofilms (p<0.001, t-test). BB12-monospecies biofilms induced significantly less mineral loss than SM in both enamel (p<0.05) and dentine (p<0.001). Viable BB12 did not significantly reduce cariogenicity of SM (p>0.05), whilst heat-inactivated BB12 decreased cariogenicity of SM in dentinal cavities (p<0.01). Bacterial numbers were higher on dentine than enamel (p<0.05), but not significantly influenced by biofilm species (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Heat-inactivated BB12 reduced the cariogenicity of SM in dentinal cavities in vitro. Inactivated probiotics might be suitable for caries control.
TI  - Effect of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . lactis DN-173010 probiotic on dental plaque and saliva in orthodontic patients.
AB  - AIM: To assess how consumption of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 probiotic for a period of 2 weeks affects salivary and dental plaque levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. METHODS: A crossover, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed with 26 volunteers. The study was divided into four periods. During periods 2 and 4, the volunteers ingested yogurt containing probiotic or control yogurt daily for 2 weeks. Periods 1 and 3 were a 1-week run-in period and 4-week washout period, respectively. Saliva and dental plaque samples were collected from each participant at the end of each period. Mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total cultivable microorganisms were counted. Values were compared between groups and across periods with the Wilcoxon's test. RESULTS: There was no difference between the yogurt containing probiotic and the control yogurt for any of the studied variables (all p > 0.05). A reduction in counts of total cultivable microorganisms was observed in dental plaque samples after ingestion of either yogurts (both p < 0.05 vs. baseline), but not in saliva (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Daily ingestion of yogurt with or without B. animalis subsp. lactis for a period of 2 weeks was beneficial in reducing total microbial counts in dental plaque. Therefore, no additional benefits were achieved by the use of the tested probiotic strain.
TI  - Administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 in early childhood: a post-trial effect on caries occurrence at four years of age.
AB  - Probiotic bifidobacteria are widely used in the prevention of childhood diseases. These bacteria are also associated with caries occurrence. The present secondary analysis in a low-caries population evaluated the effect of early administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) on caries occurrence and identified markers of dental decay in early childhood. In the original randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT00638677, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), infants (n = 106) received BB-12, xylitol or sorbitol tablets from the age of 1-2 months to 2 years with a slow-release pacifier or a spoon (daily dose of BB-12 10(10) colony-forming units, polyol 200-600 mg). The present data were collected using clinical examinations and questionnaires at the age of 4 years. The occurrence of dental caries was assessed using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System. Oral hygiene status and mutans streptococci (MS) levels were also determined. No differences were detected between the study groups in the occurrence of enamel caries (p = 0.268) or obvious dentinal caries (p = 0.201). The occurrence of caries was associated with daily consumption of sweet drinks (p = 0.028), visible plaque observed (p = 0.002) and MS detected in the dental plaque (p = 0.002). Administration of BB-12 in infancy does not seem to increase or decrease the occurrence of caries by 4 years of age in a low-caries population.
TI  - Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 administration in early childhood: a randomized clinical trial of effects on oral colonization by mutans streptococci and the probiotic.
AB  - A randomized clinical trial studied the effects of early administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) on oral colonization of (1) mutans streptococci (MS), and (2) BB-12. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, infants (n = 106) received probiotic bacteria (BB-12 group), xylitol (X group), or sorbitol (S group). Test tablets were administered twice a day (from the age of 1-2 months) with a novel slow-release pacifier or a spoon (daily dose of BB-12 10(10) CFU, polyol 200-600 mg). Samples were collected from mucosa/teeth at the age of 8 months and 2 years for BB- 12 determination (qPCR) and plate culturing of MS (MSB, TYCSB), lactobacilli (Rogosa) and yeasts (Sabouraud). The MS levels of the mothers were determined (Dentocult SM Strip Mutans). The baseline characteristics of the three groups were similar. Mean duration of tablet delivery was 14.9 +/- 6.7 months. In all groups, >90% of the mothers showed high MS counts (log CFU >/=5). MS colonization percentages of the children at the age of 2 years were rather low (BB-12 group: 6%; X group: 31%; S group: 10%; p < 0.05). The levels of lactobacilli and yeasts did not differ between the groups. BB-12 cell counts barely exceeding the detection limit were found in three of the oral samples of the 8-month-old children; however, the 2-year samples did not contain BB-12. The early administration of BB-12 did not result in permanent oral colonization of this probiotic or significantly affect MS colonization in the children.
TI  - Reduction of salivary mutans streptococci in orthodontic patients during daily consumption of yoghurt containing probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that probiotic supplements in dairy products may  affect the oral microbial ecology, but the effect in orthodontic patients has not previously been reported. The aim of the present study was to examine whether short-term consumption of fruit yogurt containing probiotic bifidobacteria would affect the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. A double-blind, randomized crossover study was performed and 24 healthy adolescents (12-16 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment were followed over four periods. During periods 2 and 4 (2 weeks each), the subjects ingested 200 g fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 (2 x 10(8) colony forming units/g) once daily or a control yogurt without viable bacteria. Periods 1 and 3 were run-in and wash-out periods of 1 and 6 weeks, respectively. Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits before and after the yogurt consumption periods. Pre- and post-treatment values within each regimen were compared with a two-tailed marginal homogeneity test for categorical data. A statistically significant reduction of salivary mutans streptococci was recorded after probiotic yogurt consumption (P < 0.05), which was in contrast to the control yogurt. No significant alterations of the salivary lactobacilli counts were observed. Short-term daily consumption of fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 may reduce the levels of mutans streptococci in saliva during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.
