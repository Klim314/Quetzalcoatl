TI  == leucine-rich repeats of bacterial surface proteins serve as common pattern recognition motifs of human scavenger receptor gp340.
AB  == scavenger receptors are innate immune molecules recognizing and inducing the clearance of non-host as well as modified host molecules. to recognize a wide pattern of invading microbes, many scavenger receptors bind to common pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids. similarly, the gp340/dmbt1 protein, a member of the human scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family, displays a wide ligand repertoire. the peptide motif vevlxxxxw derived from its scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains is involved in some of these interactions, but most of the  recognition mechanisms are unknown. in this study, we used mass spectrometry sequencing, gene inactivation, and recombinant proteins to identify streptococcus pyogenes protein spy0843 as a recognition receptor of gp340. antibodies against spy0843 are shown to protect against s. pyogenes infection, but no function or host receptor have been identified for the protein. spy0843 belongs to the leucine-rich repeat (lrr) family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. experiments with truncated forms of the recombinant proteins confirmed that the lrr region is needed in the binding of spy0843 to gp340. the same motif of two other lrr proteins, lrrg from the gram-positive s. agalactiae and bspa from the gram-negative tannerella forsythia, also mediated binding to gp340. moreover, inhibition of spy0843 binding occurred with peptides containing the vevlxxxxw motif, but also peptides devoid of the xxxxw motif inhibited binding of lrr proteins. these results thus suggest that the conserved lrr motif in bacterial proteins serves as a novel pattern recognition motif for unique core peptides of  human scavenger receptor gp340.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
