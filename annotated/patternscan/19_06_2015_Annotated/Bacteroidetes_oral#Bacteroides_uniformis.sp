TI  == bacteroides uniformis cect 7771 ameliorates metabolic and immunological dysfunction in mice with high-fat-diet induced obesity.
AB  == background: associations have been made between obesity and reduced intestinal numbers of members of the phylum bacteroidetes, but there is no direct evidence of the role these bacteria play in obesity. herein, the effects of bacteroides uniformis cect 7771 on obesity-related metabolic and immune alterations have been evaluated. methods and findings: adult (6-8 week) male wild-type c57bl-6 mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat-diet hfd to induce obesity, supplemented or not with b. uniformis cect 7771 for seven weeks. animal weight was monitored and histologic, biochemical, immunocompetent cell functions, and features of the  faecal microbiota were analysed after intervention. the oral administration of b. uniformis cect 7771 reduced body weight gain, liver steatosis and liver cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and increased small adipocyte numbers in hfd-fed mice. the strain also reduced serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin and leptin levels, and improved oral tolerance to glucose in hfd fed mice. the bacterial strain also reduced dietary fat absorption, as indicated  by the reduced number of fat micelles detected in enterocytes. moreover, b. uniformis cect 7771 improved immune defence mechanisms, impaired in obesity. hfd-induced obesity led to a decrease in tnf-alpha production by peritoneal macrophages stimulated with lps, conversely, the administration of b. uniformis cect 7771 increased tnf-alpha production and phagocytosis. administering this strain also increased tnf-alpha production by dendritic cells (dcs) in response to lps stimulation, which was significantly reduced by hfd. b. uniformis cect 7771 also restored the capacity of dcs to induce a t-cell proliferation response, which was impaired in obese mice. hfd induced marked changes in gut microbiota composition, which were partially restored by the intervention. conclusions: altogether, the findings indicate that administration of b. uniformis cect 7771 ameliorates hfd-induced metabolic and immune dysfunction associated with intestinal dysbiosis in obese mice.

TI  == effects of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the effects of difructose anhydride iii (di-d-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; dfa iii) administration (3% dfa iii for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to dgge profiles, the number of bacteria related to bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis and ruminococcus productus increased  in dfa iii-fed rat cecum. in the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats, a lowering of ph and an increase in short chain fatty acids (scfas), especially acetic acid, were observed. the dfa iii-assimilating bacterium, ruminococcus sp. m-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats. the strain had 98% similarity with r. productus atcc 27340t (l76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. these results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by dfa iii administration. moreover, dfa iii stimulated the growth of ruminococcus sp. m-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. it is expected that dfa iii would be  a new candidate as a prebiotic.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.

TI  == chromosomal dna probes for the identification of bacteroides species.
AB  == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and  b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.

TI  == taxonomy of anaerobes: present state of the art.
AB  == results of nucleic acid studies, which indicate relationships among strains and species more clearly than do usual phenotypic tests, have led to new bacteriologic nomenclature. some major changes in bacteroides include the recognition of three species (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides denticola, and bacteroides loescheii) formerly grouped in b. melaninogenicus subspecies melaninogenicus; two species (bacteroides intermedius with two closely related homology groups and bacteroides corporis) formerly grouped together as b. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius; and two species (bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oris) formerly thought to be human isolates of bacteroides ruminicola subspecies brevis. former subspecies of bacteroides fragilis have been elevated to species rank; and bacteroides uniformis and an unnamed group ("3452a"), recognized. a new genus, capnocytophaga, with three species, is composed of strains formerly classified as bacteroides ochraceus or centers for disease control (cdc) group df-1. strains previously thought to be human isolates of "vibrio succinogenes" and related organisms that derive energy by reduction of fumarate or nitrate with formate or hydrogen have been reclassified in bacteroides (bacteroides gracilis), campylobacter (campylobacter concisus), or in a new genus, wolinella.
