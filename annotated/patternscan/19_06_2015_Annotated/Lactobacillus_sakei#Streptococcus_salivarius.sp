TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.
