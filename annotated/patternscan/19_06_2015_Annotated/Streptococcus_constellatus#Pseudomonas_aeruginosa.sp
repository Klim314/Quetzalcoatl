TI  == a polymicrobial perspective of pulmonary infections exposes an enigmatic pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == lung disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. a modest number of bacterial pathogens have been correlated with pulmonary function decline; however, microbiological and molecular evidence suggests that cf airway infection is polymicrobial. to obtain a more complete assessment of the microbial community composition and dynamics, we undertook a longitudinal study by using culture-independent and microbiological approaches. in the process, we demonstrated that within complex and dynamic communities, the  streptococcus milleri group (smg) can establish chronic pulmonary infections and  at the onset of 39% of acute pulmonary exacerbations, smg is the numerically dominant pathogen. we report the comprehensive polymicrobial community dynamics of a cf lung infection in a clinically relevant context. if a given organism, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, becomes resistant to antibiotic therapy, an alternative treatment avenue may mediate the desired clinical response by effectively managing the composition of the microbial community.

TI  == surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  == background: because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. we performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. methods: all procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. there were  155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. results: one patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by staphylococcus schleiferi. the patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. one patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep  incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees c) caused by staphylococcus aureus. he was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. one patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. a group a streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. in the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus constellatus. no antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. conclusion: in our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.

TI  == effect of saliva on an antimicrobial tissue conditioner containing silver-zeolite.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of human saliva on the antimicrobial effect of a tissue conditioner containing an antibiotic agent, silver-zeolite. samples of each tissue conditioner with or without silver-zeolite were prepared and a plastic disk was used as a control. candida albicans and nosocomial respiratory infection-causing bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and the streptococcus milleri group (s. constellatus and s. intermedius), were selected as test microorganisms. antimicrobial effects of samples after water or saliva immersion for 28 days were evaluated by counting the number of viable cells [colony forming unit (cfu)] in each microbial suspension (100 microl). all data were statistically analysed by one-way anova and bonferroni's test (p < 0.05). the antimicrobial effects of samples with silver-zeolite immersed in saliva against c. albicans, s. aureus and mrsa were observed while cfu of p. aeruginosa  indicated no significant difference from that of the control. as for the s. milleri group, its cfu after saliva immersion showed the significantly smaller value than that of the control. it is concluded that the antimicrobial effects of samples containing silver-zeolite against all tested microbes except for p. aeruginosa and the s. milleri group are not influenced by saliva immersion for 28 days.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.
