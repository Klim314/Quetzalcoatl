TI  == inhibition by chestnut honey of n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones and biofilm formation in erwinia carotovora, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == bacteria are able to communicate and coordinate certain processes using small secreted signaling molecules called autoinducers. this phenomenon, known as "quorum sensing" (qs), may be essential for the synchronization of virulence factors as well as biofilm development. the interruption of bacterial qs is acknowledged to attenuate virulence and considered to be a potential new therapy  to treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria. n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones (ahls) have been identified as the main bacterial signaling molecules in gram-negative bacteria. this study evaluates the capacity of chestnut honey and its aqueous and methanolic extracts to inhibit bacterial ahl-controlled processes in erwinia carotovora , yersinia enterocolitica , and aeromonas hydrophila . this study is the first in applying liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to determine the qs inhibitory activity of honey against pathogenic  bacteria. the tandem mass spectrometry analysis of culture supernatants confirmed the presence of three main ahls: n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c6-hsl) and n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (c6-hsl) in e. carotovora and  y. enterocolitica and n-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (c4-hsl) in a. hydrophila.  the effect of chestnut honey and its aqueous and methanolic extracts (0.2 g/ml) on ahl concentration and biofilm formation in bacterial cultures was determined.  the obtained results revealed their potential use as qs inhibitors or regulators  of the degradation of qs signals, with the methanolic extract showing less inhibitory capacity. thus, the qs inhibitory activity of chestnut honey seems to  be related to the aqueous phase, suggesting that the carbohydrate fraction contains an antipathogenic substance responsible for the inhibitory activity.

TI  == extracellular secretion of carocin s1 in pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum occurs via the type iii secretion system integral to the bacterial flagellum.
AB  == background: pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum is a phytopathogenic enterobacterium responsible for soft rot, a disease characterized by extensive maceration of the affected plant tissue. this species also produces two or more antibacterial substances called bacteriocins, which enhance its competitiveness against related rival species. however, the secretion mechanism for low-molecular-weight bacteriocin is still unknown. results: a mutant (flhc::tn5)  that did not secrete the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin (lmwb), carocin s1, was generated by tn5 insertional mutagenesis. sequence analysis indicated that this insertion disrupted open reading frame 2 (orf2) and orf3 of this strain. deletion and rescue experiments indicated that orf2 and orf3 were both required for extracellular lmwb secretion. the orf2 and orf3 sequences showed high homology with the flhd and flhc gene sequences of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atroseptica, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli,  indicating that they likely encoded key regulatory components of the type iii flagella secretion system. conclusion: thus, the extracellular export of carocin  s1 by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum appears to utilize the type iii secretion system integral to bacterial flagella.

TI  == control of foodborne pathogens and soft-rot bacteria on bell pepper by three strains of bacterial antagonists.
AB  == forty-two representative strains of native bacteria associated with fresh peeled  baby carrots were isolated and characterized. two of these strains, identified as pseudomonas fluorescens ag3a (pf ag3a) and bacillus yd1, were evaluated in conjunction with another known antagonist, p. fluorescens 2-79 (pf 2-79), for their potential as biocontrol agents of human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7) and soft-rot bacteria (erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, pseudomonas marginalis,  and pseudomonas viridiflava). when grown on iron-deficient agar media, all three  antagonists produced inhibition zones up to 25 mm in diameter against the growth  of human pathogens and soft-rot bacteria. however, when grown on iron-rich agar media, only pf 2-79 and bacillus yd1 exhibited antimicrobial activity. treatment  of bell pepper disks with pf 2-79 or bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogen  by 1.4 to 4.1 log units, depending upon the ratio of the number of antagonist cells to pathogen cells (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1). the greatest reduction was observed when 10- to 100-fold higher number of antagonists than pathogens was applied. pf ag3a and bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogens on pepper disks at 20 degrees c but not at 10 degrees c. however, pf 2-79 reduced the growth of l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica by up to 4 log units at either 20 or 10 degrees c. treatment of pepper disks with pf 2-79 also reduced the incidence of soft rot induced by soft-rot bacteria by 40 to 70%. pf 2-79 is the most effective of the three antagonists tested for control of spoilage bacteria and human pathogens on bell pepper.

TI  == comparative genomics of the kdgr regulon in erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 and other gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  == in the plant-pathogenic enterobacterium erwinia chrysanthemi, almost all known genes involved in pectin catabolism are controlled by the transcriptional regulator kdgr. in this study, the comparative genomics approach was used to analyse the kdgr regulon in completely sequenced genomes of eight enterobacteria, including erw. chrysanthemi, and two vibrio species. application of a signal recognition procedure complemented by operon structure and protein sequence analysis allowed identification of new candidate genes of the kdgr regulon. most  of these genes were found to be controlled by the camp-receptor protein, a global regulator of catabolic genes. at the next step, regulation of these genes in erw. chrysanthemi was experimentally verified using in vivo transcriptional fusions and an attempt was made to clarify the functional role of the predicted genes in  pectin catabolism. interestingly, it was found that the kdgr protein, previously  known as a repressor, positively regulates expression of two new members of the regulon, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene ppsa and an adjacent gene, ydia, of unknown function. other predicted regulon members, namely chmx, dhfx, gntb, pykf, spix, sota, tpfx, yeeo and yjgk, were found to be subject to classical negative regulation by kdgr. possible roles of newly identified members of the erw. chrysanthemi kdgr regulon, chmx, dhfx, gntdbmnac, spix, tpfx, ydia, yeeo, ygjv and yjgk, in pectin catabolism are discussed. finally, complete reconstruction of the kdgr regulons in various gamma-proteobacteria yielded a metabolic map reflecting a globally conserved pathway for the catabolism of pectin and its derivatives with variability in transport and enzymic capabilities among species. in particular, possible non-orthologous substitutes of isomerase kdui and a new oligogalacturonide transporter in the vibrio species were detected.

TI  == potato plants genetically modified to produce n-acylhomoserine lactones increase  susceptibility to soft rot erwiniae.
AB  == many gram-negative bacteria employ n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahl) to regulate diverse physiological processes in concert with cell population density (quorum sensing [qs]). in the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora, the ahl synthesized via  the cari/expi genes are responsible for regulating the production of secreted plant cell wall-degrading exoenzymes and the antibiotic carbapen-3-em carboxylic  acid. we have previously shown that targeting the product of an ahl synthase gene (yeni) from yersinia enterocolitica to the chloroplasts of transgenic tobacco plants caused the synthesis in planta of the cognate ahl signaling molecules n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-c6-hsl) and n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (c6-hsl), which in turn, were able to complement a cari-qs mutant. in the present study, we demonstrate that transgenic potato plants containing the yeni gene are also able to express ahl and that the presence and level of these ahl in the plant increases susceptibility to infection by e. carotovora. susceptibility  is further affected by both the bacterial level and the plant tissue under investigation.

TI  == plants genetically modified to produce n-acylhomoserine lactones communicate with bacteria.
AB  == n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls) play a critical role in plant/microbe interactions. the ahl, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl), induces exoenzymes that degrade the plant cell wall by the pathogenic bacterium erwinia carotovora. conversely, the antifungal activity of the biocontrol bacterium pseudomonas aureofaciens 30-84 is due (at least in part) to phenazine antibiotics whose synthesis is regulated by n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (hhl). targeting the product of an ahl synthase gene (yeni) from yersinia enterocolitica to the chloroplasts of transgenic tobacco plants caused the synthesis in plants of the cognate ahl signaling molecules (ohhl and hhl). the ahls produced by the transgenic plants were sufficient to induce target gene expression in several recombinant bacterial ahl biosensors and to restore biocontrol activity to an hhl-deficient p. aureofaciens strain. in addition, pathogenicity was restored to  an e. carotovora strain rendered avirulent as a consequence of a mutation in the  ohhl synthase gene, cari. the ability to generate bacterial quorum-sensing signaling molecules in the plant offers novel opportunities for disease control and for manipulating plant/microbe interactions.

TI  == identification and cloning of an erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora bacteriocin regulator gene by insertional mutagenesis.
AB  == avirulent erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora cge234-m403 produces two types of  bacteriocin. for the purpose of cloning the bacteriocin genes of strain cge234m403, a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of this strain, m-rif-11-2, was isolated. by tn5 insertional mutagenesis using m-rif-11-2, a mutant, tm01a01, which produces the high-molecular-weight bacteriocin but not the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin was obtained. by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr, the dna sequence from the tn5 insertion site and the dna sequence of a contiguous 1,280-bp region were determined. one complete open reading frame (orf), designated orf2, was identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end  of another orf, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. downstream from orf2, the 5' end of another orf (orf3) was found. deduction from the nucleotide sequence indicated that orf2 encodes a protein of 99 amino acids, which showed high homology with yersinia enterocolitica yrp, a regulator of enterotoxin (y-st) production; escherichia coli host factor 1, required for qbeta-replicase; and azorhizobium caulinodans nrfa, required for the expression of nifa. orf2 was designated brg, bacteriocin regulator gene. a fragment containing orf2 and its promoter was amplified and cloned into pbr322 and phsg415r, and the recombinant plasmids, pbyl1 and phyl1, were transferred into e. coli dh5. plasmid pbyl1 was reisolated and transferred into the insertion mutant tm01a01. transformants carrying the plasmid, which was reisolated and designated pbyl1, re-produced the  low-molecular-weight bacteriocin.

TI  == the rap and hor proteins of erwinia, serratia and yersinia: a novel subgroup in a growing superfamily of proteins regulating diverse physiological processes in bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the enteric bacterium serratia marcescens is an opportunistic human pathogen. the strain atcc39006 makes the red pigment, prodigiosin (pig), and the beta-lactam antibiotic carbapenem (car). mutants were isolated that were concomitantly defective for pig and car production. these mutants were found to have a mutation in the rap gene (regulation of antibiotic and pigment). sequence analysis of the  rap gene revealed a predicted protein product showing strong homology to slya, originally thought to be a haemolytic virulence determinant in salmonella typhimurium. homologues of rap were detected in several bacterial genera, including salmonella, yersinia, enterobacter, and species of the plant pathogen,  erwinia. the erwinia hoeer (homologue of rap) and the yersinia horye genes were also found to be very similar to rap and slya. marker exchange mutagenesis of horer revealed that it encoded a regulatory protein controlling the production of antibiotic and exoenzyme virulence determinants in the phytopathogen, erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora. we have shown that these new homologues of slya form a highly conserved subgroup of a growing superfamily of bacterial regulatory proteins controlling diverse physiological processes in human, animal and plant pathogens.
