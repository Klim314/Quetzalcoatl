TI  == effects of baseplates of orthodontic appliances with in situ generated silver nanoparticles on cariogenic bacteria: a randomized, double-blind cross-over clinical trial.
AB  == aim: polymethyl-methacrylate (pmma) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (boa). the activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on  these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. the pmma incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (nanoag-i-pmma) and nanoag in situ in pmma (nanoag-is-pmma) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic  application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. the  main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using nanoag-is-pmma and nanoag-i-pmma for construction of new boa in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. materials and  methods: twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental boa, nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa, contained 0.5% w/w nanoag while the control boa was standard pmma. antibacterial effect of  nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. results: the average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test boa. bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that nanoag-i-boa and nanoag-is-boa  inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to boa. nanoag-is-boa had a strong anti-bioflm effect against s. mutans, s. sobrinus and  l. casei. however, nanoag-i-boa showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, nanoag-is-boa showed a higher antibacterial activity than nanoag-i-boa. conclusion: based on the novel data that presented here, the nanoag-is-boa had strong antimicrobial activity in  the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria.  clinical significance: wearing of nanoag-is-boa has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.

TI  == an assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  == there is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. in this study, the adhesion of 10 lactobacillus species was investigated using h357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. the results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation  (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). all strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity.  all strains, except lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. there was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, p < 0.001). the highest mean for  autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the lact. gasseri strains. correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. this study indicated that the lact. gasseri, lact. fermentum, and lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. it should also be emphasized  that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. significance and impact of the study: adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. these abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. this is the first study to investigate the oral lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. significant results were found for  the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for  aggregation among certain strains of lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei. this observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use  in oral health.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions: microhardness and polarized light miscroscopy analyses.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions by microhardness and polarized light microscopy analyses. one hundred blocks of bovine enamel were randomly divided into four groups (n = 25) according to the bacterial model for caries induction: (a) streptococcus mutans, (b) s. mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus, (c) s. mutans and l. casei, and (d) s. mutans, l. acidophilus, and l. casei. within each group, the blocks were randomly divided into five subgroups according to the duration of the period of caries induction (4-20 days). the enamel blocks were immersed in cariogenic solution containing the microorganisms, which was changed every 48 h. groups c and d presented lower surface hardness values (smh) and higher area of hardness loss (deltas) after the cariogenic challenge than groups a and b (p < 0.05). as regards lesion depth, under polarized light microscopy, group a presented significantly lower values, and groups c and d the highest values. group b showed a higher value than group a (p  < 0.05). groups a and b exhibited subsurface caries lesions after all treatment durations, while groups c and d presented erosion-type lesions with surface softening. the model using s. mutans, whether or not it was associated with l. acidophilus, was less aggressive and may be used for the induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions. the optimal period for inducing caries-like lesions was 8 days. microsc. res. tech. 78:444-451, 2015.

TI  == improvement of exopolysaccharide production in lactobacillus casei lc2w by overexpression of nadh oxidase gene.
AB  == lactobacillus casei lc2w is an exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing strain with probiotic effects. to investigate the regulation mechanism of eps biosynthesis and to improve eps production through cofactor engineering, a h(2)o-forming nadh  oxidase gene was cloned from streptococcus mutans and overexpressed in l. casei lc2w under the control of constitutive promoter p(2)(3). the recombinant strain lc-nox exhibited 0.854 u/ml of nadh oxidase activity, which was elevated by almost 20-fold in comparison with that of wild-type strain. as a result, overexpression of nadh oxidase resulted in a reduction in growth rate. in addition, lactate production was decreased by 22% in recombinant strain. it was proposed that more carbon source was saved and used for the biosynthesis of eps,  the production of which was reached at 219.4 mg/l, increased by 46% compared to that of wild-type strain. this work provided a novel and convenient genetic approach to manipulate metabolic flux and to increase eps production. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which correlates cofactor engineering  with eps production.

TI  == effects of biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus casei on gtfb, gtfc, and ftf gene expression level in s. mutans by real-time rt-pcr.
AB  == background: the streptococci are the pioneer strains in plaque formation and streptococcus mutans are the main etiological agent of dental plaque and caries.  in general, biofilm formation is a step-wise process, which begins by adhesion of planktonic cells to the surfaces. evidences show that expression of glucosyltransferase b and c (gtfb and gtfc) and fructosyltransferase (ftf) genes  play critical role in initial adhesion of s. mutans to the tooth surface which results in formation of dental plaques and consequently caries and other periodontal disease. materials and methods: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of biosurfactants produced by a probiotic strain; lactobacillus casei (atcc39392) on gene expression profile of gftb/c and tft of s. mutans (atcc35668) using quantitative real-time pcr. results: the application  of the prepared biosurfactant caused dramatic down regulation of all the three genes under study. the reduction in gene expression was statistically highly significant (for gtfb, p > 0.0002; for gtfc, p > 0.0063, and for ftf, p > 0.0057). conclusion: considerable downregulation of all three genes in the presence of the prepared biosurfactant comparing to untreated controls is indicative of successful inhibition of influential genes in bacterial adhesion phenomena. in view of the importance of glucosyltransferase gene products for s.mutans attachment to the tooth surface which is the initial important step in biofilm production and dental caries, further research in this field may lead to  an applicable alternative for successful with least adverse side effects in dental caries prevention.

TI  == antibacterial dental composites with chlorhexidine and mesoporous silica.
AB  == one of the leading causes for the failure of dental composite restorations is secondary caries. effectively inhibiting cariogenic biofilms and reducing secondary caries could extend the service life of composite restorations. dental  composites releasing antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine (chx) have shown  biofilm-inhibitory efficacy, but they usually have poor physical and mechanical properties. herein, we present a study of a new method to encapsulate and release chx from dental composite using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (msns). sba-15 msns were synthesized according to a reported procedure. chx (62.9 wt%) was encapsulated into dried msn from 0.3 m chx ethanol solution. the dental composites containing 0% (control), 3%, 5%, and 6.3% chx or the same amounts of chx entrapped in msn (denoted as chx@msn) were fabricated with methacrylate monomers and silanized glass fillers (chx or chx@msn + glass filler particle = 70 wt%). the monomer mixture consisted of bisphenol a glycidyl methacrylate (bisgma), hexanediol dimethacrylate (hddma), ethoxylated bisphenol a dimethacrylate (ebpadma), and urethane dimethacrylates (uedma) at a weight ratio  of 40:30:20:10. the composites were tested for chx release and recharge, flexural strength and modulus (at 24 hr and 1 mo), surface roughness, in vitro wear, and antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei (in both planktonic growth and biofilm formation). the results showed that the composites with chx@msn largely retained mechanical properties and smooth surfaces and showed controlled release of chx over a long time. in contrast, the  composites with directly mixed chx showed reduced mechanical properties, rough surfaces, and burst release of chx in a short time. the composites with chx either directly mixed or in msn showed strong inhibition to s. mutans and l. casei. this research has demonstrated the successful application of msns as a novel nanotechnology in dental materials to inhibit oral biofilm without sacrificing materials' mechanical properties and surface integrity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and synergism of lactoferrin and lysozyme against cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the present study evaluated the antimicrobial in vitro effects of the salivary proteins lactoferrin and lysozyme on microorganisms involved in the carious process, obtaining their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175) and lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469) were submitted to broth macrodilution of lysozyme at 80 mg/ml and lactoferrin at 200 mg/ml. the tubes were read in a spectrophotometer after they had been incubated at 37 degrees c for 18 h, in a carbon dioxide chamber, in order to read the mic. a new subculture was carried on agar plates to obtain the mbc. the agar diffusion method was also tested, using bhi agar with 100 microl of the standardized microbial inocula. filter-paper disks soaked in 10 microl of the solutions lactoferrin (200 microg/ml) and lysozyme (80 microg/ml) were placed on the agar surface. inhibition halos were not observed on the plates, showing the absence of the antimicrobial effects of these proteins in this method. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects of lysozyme on l. casei were 50.3 mg/ml and 43.1 mg/ml respectively. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects on s. mutans were 68.5 mg/ml and 58.7 mg/ml. lactoferrin did not induce any inhibitory effects on any microorganism, even in the concentration of 200 mg/ml. there was not a synergic antimicrobial effect of proteins, when they were tested together, even in the concentration of  42.8 mg/ml of lysozyme and 114 mg/ml of lactoferrin (the highest values evaluated). s. mutans and l. casei were only inhibited by lysozyme, not affected  by lactoferrin and by the synergic use of both proteins.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == effect of a novel quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) on adhesion and antibacterial properties of dental adhesives.
AB  == this study investigated the resin-dentin bond strength (mutbs), degree of conversion (dc), and antibacterial potential of an innovative adhesive system containing a quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) using in situ and in vitro assays. forty-two human third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and were randomly distributed into three groups of self-etching adhesive  systems: clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp (experimental group), clearfil protect bond (positive control) and clearfil se bond (negative control). after light curing, three 1 mm-increments of composite resin were bonded to each dentin surface. a total of thirty of these bonded teeth (10 teeth per group) was sectioned to obtain stick-shaped specimens and tested under tensile stress immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of storage in distilled water. twelve bonded teeth (4 teeth per group) were longitudinally sectioned in a mesio-to-distal direction to obtain resin-bonded dentin slabs. in situ dc was evaluated by micro-raman spectroscopy. in vitro dc of thin films of each adhesive system was measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. in vitro susceptibility tests of these three adhesive systems were performed by the minimum inhibitory/minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc) assays against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces naeslundii. no statistically significant difference in mutbs was observed between clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp and clearfil se bond (p>0.05) immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of water storage. however clearfil protect bond showed a significant reduction of mutbs after 12 months of storage (p=0.039). in addition, qamp provided no significant change in dc after incorporating into clearfil se bond (p>0.05). clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp demonstrated mic/mbc values similar to the positive control against l. casei and a. naeslundii and higher than the negative control for all evaluated bacterial strains. the use of qamp in an adhesive system demonstrated effective bond strength, a suitable degree of conversion, and adequate antibacterial effects against oral bacteria, and may be  useful as a new approach to provide long-lasting results for dental adhesives.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == composition and activity against oral pathogens of the essential oil of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc.
AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc. (asteraceae) was characterized by gc-fid and  gc/ms analyses. (e)-caryophyllene (56.0%), germacrene d (12.7%), and bicyclogermacrene (9.2%) were identified as the major oil components. the antimicrobial activity of the oil against seven standard strains of oral pathogens from the american type culture collection (atcc) was evaluated by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. mic values below 100 mug/ml were obtained against streptococcus sobrinus  (90 mug/ml), lactobacillus casei (30 mug/ml), s. mutans (20 mug/ml), and s. mitis (18 mug/ml). in contrast, the mic values of the major oil compound (e)-caryophyllene were higher than 400 mug/ml against all pathogens, suggesting that the activity of the oil might depend on minor oil components and/or on synergistic effects. the m. divaricatum essential oil is a promising agent to include in anticariogenic oral rinse formulations for the control of oral pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == antibacterial activity, fluoride release, and physical properties of an antibiotic-modified glass ionomer cement.
AB  == purpose: this study's purpose was to examine the influence of adding an antibiotic mixture to conventional glass ionomer cement (gic) on its antibacterial activity, fluoride-releasing ability, and physical properties. methods: an antibiotic mixture containing ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was added to gic at concentration ratios of one percent weight antibiotic/weight total powder before mixing (w/w; group 1) and two percent w/w (group 2) to obtain the test groups. conventional gic served as the control. the antibacterial activity of the cement specimens was evaluated against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei using the agar inhibition test. the fluoride release from the cement specimens was evaluated using a fluoride ion selective electrode. the physical parameters evaluated were net setting time, compressive strength, shear  bond strength, and microleakage. results: group 2 showed a significantly greater  inhibition zone than group 1 against both tested organisms, while the control did not inhibit organism growth. the addition of antibiotics at one percent and two percent to gic enhanced its fluoride release. at two percent, however, the physical properties of gic were adversely affected. conclusion: antibiotics at one percent weight solute/weight total solution after mixing may modestly confer  an antibacterial activity to glass ionomer cement and enhance its fluoride-releasing ability. its effects on shear bond strength and microleakage were found to be encouraging.

TI  == antibacterial activity, surface roughness, flexural strength, and solubility of conventional luting cements containing chlorhexidine diacetate/cetrimide mixtures.
AB  == statement of problem: the failure of fixed dental restorations is commonly associated with caries. the use of conventional luting cements containing antibacterial agents may overcome this problem. purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity (aba), surface roughness (ra), flexural strength (fs), and solubility (sl) patterns of the conventional dental luting cements zinc phosphate (zp), zinc polycarboxylate (pc), and glass ionomer  (gic) after the addition of 5% chlorhexidine diacetate/cetrimide (chx+ct). material and methods: antibacterial agents with a total concentration of 5% (2.5% chx+2.5% ct) were added to antibacterial agent-free conventional luting cement powders (zpc, pcc, and gicc) and designated as experimental groups (zpe, pce, and gice). aba against streptococcus mutans (sm) and lactobacillus casei (lb) was examined by using the agar diffusion test method. ra, fs, and sl values were obtained after storage in distilled water at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. the kruskal-wallis and mann whitney u with bonferroni correction tests were used to test for agar diffusion (alpha=.05) and 2-way anova and fisher least significant  difference (lsd) test were used to measure ra, fs, and sl (alpha=.05). results: the control groups exhibited limited aba. with the exception of pce>pcc on day 1  for sm, all experimental groups showed significantly greater and longer-lasting protection against sm and lb bacteria for up to 180 days than their controls (p<.05). ra values decreased (zpc>zpe; p>.05, pcc>pce; p<.05) except that gice>gicc (p>.05) when compared with their individual controls. control groups exhibited higher fs values than did the experimental groups (zpc>zpe; p<.05, pcc>pce; p<.05, gicc>gice; p>.05). the experimental groups exhibited higher solubilities than did their controls in the zpc (p>.05) and gicc groups (p<.05) but were lower in pcc group (p<.05). conclusions: incorporating a 5% chx+ct mixture into conventional dental luting cements and altering their ra, fs, and sl values may provide greater antibacterial protection against sm and lb.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == high strength re-mineralizing, antibacterial dental composites with reactive calcium phosphates.
AB  == objective: development of high strength dental composites with adhesive, antibacterial and re-mineralizing potential. materials: urethane and triethylene  glycol dimethacrylates were combined with hema (10 or 20wt%) and 2mp (2 or 10wt%), antibacterial chlorhexidine (2.5wt%) and chemical cure initiators. reactive mono/tri calcium phosphate (cp) mixed with silica/silicon carbide nanoparticles (s) (cp:s weight ratio 1:2 or 2:1) was added (50wt%). results: decreasing cp/s ratio and hema content reduced monomer conversion at 15min from 93 to 63%. conversely, decreasing cp/s increased initial "dry" compressive (137-203mpa) and flexural (79-116mpa) strength. with high hema content, these decreased by approximately 15-20mpa upon 24h water storage. with low hema content, average decline was <8mpa due to reduced water sorption. early water sorption induced mass increase, volume expansion, mono calcium phosphate dissolution and chlorhexidine release, were proportional to the initial calcium phosphate content. furthermore, they increased approximately 1.5 fold upon raising hema wt%. these diffusion controlled processes and strength decline slowed after 24h as phosphates reaction bound water within the materials. increasing 2mp concentration reduced calcium release but did not affect strength. formulations with high cp/s indicated greater antibacterial activity in agar diffusion and in vitro biofilm tests. significance: new material use beneath a conventional composite could potentially reduce high failure rates associated with residual caries and bacterial microleakage.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of an antimicrobial monomer for application in prosthodontics.
AB  == purpose: this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of the monomer methacryloyloxyundecylpyridinium bromide (mupb), an antiseptic agent capable of copolymerizing with denture base acrylic resins. materials and methods: the antimicrobial activity of mupb was tested against the  species candida albicans, candida dubliniensis, candida glabrata, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans. the minimum inhibitory and fungicidal/bactericidal concentrations (mic, mfc/mbc) of mupb were determined by serial dilutions in comparison with cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc). the cytotoxic effects of mupb at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 g/l were assessed by mtt test on l929 cells and compared with methyl methacrylate (mma). the antimicrobial activity of copolymerized mupb was tested by means of acrylic resin specimens containing three concentrations of the monomer (0, 0.3, 0.6% w/w). activity was quantified by means of a disc diffusion test and a quantification of adhered planktonic cells. statistical analysis employed the mann-whitney test for mic and mfc/mbc, and anova for the microbial adherence test (alpha = 0.05). results: mubp presented lower mic values when compared with cpc,  although differences were significant for c. dubliniensis and s. mutans only (p=  0.046 and 0.043, respectively). mfc/mbc values were similar for all species except c. albicans; in that case, mupb presented significantly higher values (p = 0.046). mupb presented higher cytotoxicity than mma for all tested concentrations (p < 0.001) except at 0.01 g/l. irrespective of the concentration incorporated and species, there was no inhibition halo around the specimens. the incorporation of mupb influenced the adhesion of c. albicans only (p = 0.003), with lower cfu counts for the 0.6% group. conclusions: it was concluded that non-polymerized mupb has an antimicrobial capacity close to that of cpc and high cytotoxicity when compared with mma. the antimicrobial activity of mupb after incorporation within a denture base acrylic resin did not depend on its elution, but was shown  to be restricted to c. albicans.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion on cariogenic planktonic and biofilm organisms.
AB  == introduction: nanoemulsions (ne) are a unique class of disinfectants produced by  mixing a water immiscible liquid phase into an aqueous phase under high shear forces. ne have antimicrobial properties and are also effective anti-biofilm agents. materials and methods: the effectiveness of nanoemulsion and its components was determined against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei by live/dead staining. in vitro antimicrobial effectiveness of nanoemulsion against  planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, actinomyces viscosus, candida albicans and mixed  culture was determined by a serial dilution technique to obtain minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). in addition, efficacy was investigated by kinetics of killing, adherence and biofilm assays. results: compared to its components, nanoemulsion showed notable antimicrobial activity against biofilm organisms, up to 83.0% kill within 1min. ne dilutions ranging from 243 to 19683 were effective against planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed culture of these four strains as shown through mic/mbc assays. ne showed antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells at high dilutions, confirmed by time kill studies. the level of  adhesion on glass surface was reduced by 94.2-99.5% in nanoemulsion treated groups (p<0.001). 4-day-old s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed cultures biofilms treated with ne showed reductions of bacterial counts with decreasing dilutions (p<0.001). conclusion: these results suggest that nanoemulsion has effective anti-cariogenic activity against cariogenic microorganisms and may be a useful medication in the prevention of caries.

TI  == use of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique for in vivo detection of  cariogenic microorganisms on metallic brackets, with or without use of an antimicrobial agent.
AB  == objective: using checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation (cddh) assay, this randomised clinical study evaluated the contamination of metallic brackets by four cariogenic bacterial strains (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus) and the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) mouthwashes in reducing bacterial contamination. methods: thirty-nine 11-33-year-old patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances were enrolled in the study and had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to premolars. nineteen patients used a 0.12% chx mouthwash (periogard) and 20 patients used a placebo mouthwash (control) twice a week. after 30 days, the brackets were removed and samples were obtained for analysis by cddh. data were analysed statistically by the kruskal-wallis test (alpha=0.05) using the sas software. results: s. mutans, s. sobrinus, l. casei and l. acidophilus were detected in 100% of the samples from both groups. however, brackets of the control group were more heavily contaminated by s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p<0.01). in the experimental group, although all counts decreased after rinsing  with the chlorhexidine solution, there was significant difference only for s. mutans (p=0.03). conclusions: the use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes can be useful in clinical practice to reduce the levels of cariogenic microorganisms in patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == development and evaluation of a safe and effective sugar-free herbal lollipop that kills cavity-causing bacteria.
AB  == dental caries (tooth decay) is caused by a specific group of cariogenic bacteria, like streptococcus mutans, which convert dietary sugars into acids that dissolve  the mineral in tooth structure. killing cariogenic bacteria is an effective way to control or prevent tooth decay. in a previous study, we discovered a novel compound (glycyrrhizol a), from the extraction of licorice roots, with strong antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. in the current study, we developed a method to produce these specific herbal extracts in large quantities, and then used these extracts to develop a sugar-free lollipop that effectively kills cariogenic bacteria like streptococcus mutans. further studies showed that  these sugar-free lollipops are safe and their antimicrobial activity is stable. two pilot human studies indicate that a brief application of these lollipops (twice a day for ten days) led to a marked reduction of cariogenic bacteria in oral cavity among most human subjects tested. this herbal lollipop could be a novel tool to promote oral health through functional foods.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == the antibacterial effect of gas ozone after 2 months of in vitro evaluation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of healozone on two microorganisms, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, using a tooth cavity model. four groups of caries-free third molars (n = 12) were used (a, b, c and d). three cavities were prepared into each tooth. after sterilization, groups a and b were  inoculated with streptococcus mutans, and groups c and d, with lactobacillus casei for 48 h. one cavity of each tooth was used to evaluate the infection. after inoculation, groups b and d were treated with ozone (60 s), and groups a and c were used as controls. then, the two cavities of each tooth were filled with composite, and the teeth were stored in sucrose medium. the restorations were removed after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively; dentin chips were collected, and  the amount of microorganisms was determined. ozone treatment reduced significantly the amount of s. mutans compared to the control group (p </= 0.05). this antibacterial effect was able to be seen after 4 (p = 0.0005) and 8 (p = 0.0002) weeks. no significant difference was found between the control and treated group as far as l. casei is concerned (p > 0.05). healozone (60 s) can provide some antibacterial treatment against s. mutans even after 8 weeks. however, an elimination of the microorganisms through healozone seems not to be possible. l. casei was more resistant to ozone. although ozone exerts a significant antibacterial effect against s. mutans, it is probably not enough as  the only antibacterial method, during the fillings therapy.

TI  == phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with  probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.

TI  == microbiota of dentinal caries as assessed by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to identify the microbiota of different layers  of dentinal caries by using a culture-independent molecular biology approach. methods: dna was extracted from samples taken from 3 distinct layers (superficial, middle and deep) of advanced occlusal caries and analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 28 oral bacterial species/phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. results: the mean number of target taxa per layer was 7.7 (+/- 3.96) in the superficial, 7 (+/- 3.4) in the middle, and 6.3 (+/- 3.04) in the deep layer. no statistical significance was observed for these differences (p = 0.36). overall, the most prevalent taxa in the 3 layers were atopobium genomospecies c1 (72.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (69%), lactobacillus casei (68%), veillonella species (55%) and lactobacillus fermentum (52%). no differences were found in the prevalence rates of the most frequent target species in the 3 layers. the most prevalent taxa found at levels  above 10(5) in the advanced front line of deep-dentin caries were atopobium genomospecies c1, f. nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus species and veillonella species. conclusion: the present results revealed that the prevalences of several established or candidate caries pathogens do not differ significantly in the different zones of dentinal caries lesions. the finding that some as-yet-uncharacterized species and novel species were found in high frequencies join other molecular studies to include them in the set of candidate  caries pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == killing of adherent oral microbes by a non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet.
AB  == atmospheric plasma jets are being intensively studied with respect to potential applications in medicine. the aim of this in vitro study was to test a microwave-powered non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet for its antimicrobial efficacy against adherent oral micro-organisms. agar plates and dentin slices were inoculated with 6 log(10) c.f.u. cm(-2) of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans, with escherichia coli as a control. areas of 1 cm(2) on the agar plates or the complete dentin slices were irradiated with a helium plasma jet for 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9 s mm(-2), respectively. the agar plates were incubated at 37 degrees c, and dentin slices were vortexed in liquid  media and suspensions were placed on agar plates. the killing efficacy of the plasma jet was assessed by counting the number of c.f.u. on the irradiated areas  of the agar plates, as well as by determination of the number of c.f.u. recovered from dentin slices. a microbe-killing effect was found on the irradiated parts of the agar plates for l. casei, s. mutans, c. albicans and e. coli. the plasma-jet  treatment reduced the c.f.u. by 3-4 log(10) intervals on the dentin slices in comparison to recovery rates from untreated controls. the microbe-killing effect  was correlated with increasing irradiation times. thus, non-thermal atmospheric plasma jets could be used for the disinfection of dental surfaces.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of ocimum americanum l. essential oil against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the essential oil of ocimum americanum l. on in vitro activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. an agar disk diffusion method was employed for screening antimicrobial activity. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum cidal concentration (mcc) values of the oil against planktonic  cells were determined using the millipore membrane method. the antimicrobial potential of the essential oil was also investigated with a biofilm model. the results indicate that essential oil has antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. the mic values of the oil against the three organisms was 0.04% v/v whereas the mcc values for s. mutans, l. casei and c. albicans were 0.08%, 0.3% and 0.08% v/v, respectively. s. mutans and c. albicans were more sensitive to the essential oil than l. casei. with the biofilm assay, a 5-minute exposure to 3% v/v essential oil eliminated 3 logo10 of the tested microorganisms. at a lower concentration (0.3% v/v), a 2 log10 reduction in s. mutans and c. albicans  was observed while the lactobacilli were more resistant. this finding indicates the possibility of using the essential oil of o. americanum l. in oral health care products for reducing these pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == culture-based pcr analysis of plaque samples of japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of japanese elementary school children through pcr analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. this epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 japanese elementary school  children. assessed using the cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. dna detection of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. except for s. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. caries risk assessed using cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial dna for pcr analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species.
AB  == objective: the aim was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species with and without the presence of saliva and a possible effect on the salivary proteins. methods: suspensions of actinomyces naeslundii (actcc 12104(t)), lactobacilli casei (n ctc 151) and streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), in salt buffer or in saliva, were exposed to ozone gas delivered by the ozone generator healozone 2130c. aliquots of the suspensions were taken after 10, 30 and 60s ozone exposures and cultivated on agar plates. initial number of bacteria per ml was 8.0 x 10(7) (sd 2.2 x 10(7)) (a. naeslundii), 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 3.1 x 10(6)) (l. casei) and 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 7.0 x 10(5)) (s. mutans), respectively. the proteins were separated by sds electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. results: in salt buffer 92%, 73% and 64% of the initial numbers of a. naeslundii, s. mutans and l. casei, respectively, were killed already after 10s ozone exposure, while approximately 99.9% of the bacteria were dead after a 60s exposure. after 10 and 30s, but not after 60s exposure to ozone, s. mutans and l. casei were less efficiently killed  in saliva compared to the salt buffer. various saliva proteins were degraded by ozone after a 60s exposure. conclusions: the cariogenic species s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii were almost eliminated following 60s of ozone treatment.  this killing was reduced in the presence of saliva although increasing the ozone  application time to 60s overcame these reductants in saliva. detection of altered salivary proteins indicates that saliva components constitute additional targets  for ozone.

TI  == antibacterial activity and physical properties of glass-ionomer cements containing antibiotics.
AB  == this study evaluated the antibacterial effects, physical properties and bonding strengths of conventional glass-ionomer cements (gics) containing antibiotics and determined the optimal concentration of antibiotics addition for use with the art approach. fuji ix gic was used as a control. three antibiotic mixtures, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and minocycline, were added to powdered gic (fuji ix) to obtain concentration ratios of 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5% w/w. the antibacterial activity of each gic was evaluated against streptococcus mutans or lactobacillus  casei using agar-diffusion methods. the release of antibiotics was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the compressive strength and bonding strength to dentin were measured and compared with those of control samples. the results were analyzed using the mann-whitney test and wilcoxon test. all tested groups showed a significantly greater inhibition with growth of the selected bacteria in comparison to the control groups (p < 0.01). however, the 3% and 4.5% concentration ratios of antibiotics had significantly lower compressive  strength and lower bond strength to dentin than the control group (p = 0.003). the gic-containing antibiotics were effective in inhibiting s mutans and l casei. the addition of a 1.5% antibiotic mixture was optimal to giving appropriate physical and bonding properties.

TI  == pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (pa); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of pa were the most active compounds, displaying mic values ranging from 2 to 8 microg ml(-1). thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == novel chlorhexidine releasing system developed from thermosensitive vinyl ether-based hydrogels.
AB  == the aim of this study is to determine the effective concentrations of chlorhexidine on the release for prolonged periods of time from a novel hydrogel  system. a hydrogel that exhibits a volume phase transition in response to temperature was synthesized by radiation copolymerization of ethylene glycol vinyl ether and butyl vinyl ether in the presence of crosslinking agent, diethylene glycol divinyl ether. hydrogel samples in the disc form (diameter, 10  mm and height, 1.5 mm) were utilized as a matrix for the release of an antimicrobial agent, chlorhexidine diacetate. chlorhexidine loading into the hydrogel was performed by water sorption at 4 degrees c, which allows high swelling and thus high loading capacity, i.e., approximately 36 mg drug per gram  of dry gel. chlorhexidine release was examined as short-term (24 h) and long-term (27 days) by uv spectrophotometer. microbial studies were carried out by micro-dilution method in order to determine the effectiveness of the drug release. minimum inhibitory concentration values for the pathogens of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei were determined. the long-term chlorhexidine release is initially very fast. after that, the drug release reaches a slow but a steady rate. such a release pattern provides an effective drug release. the prolonged release of chlorhexidine is continued up to the 27th  day. mic values for the two pathogens have been shown that the release rate from  disc is effective to inhibit the growth of pathogens. these in vitro drug release results suggested that the thermosensitive hydrogel system developed in this study can be evaluated as a delivery system for the release of chlorhexidine.

TI  == antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans (ingbritt), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), lactobacillus casei (atcc 393), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) and candida albicans (atcc 90028). the results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (f=38.290; p<0.01). the six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. among them, longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by zno whisker  antibacterial complex (znow) at-83, ionpure-h, basic magnesium hypochlorite, znow at-88 and antim-ams2. the broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.

TI  == effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: this study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. methods: aqueous extracts of miswak (salvadora persica; arak tree) and derum (juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of balb/c 3t3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. results: the data revealed that balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). furthermore, extracts from both miswak  and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at  much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. the most sensitive organisms were a. viscosus, followed by s. mutans, s. salivarius, with l. casei being the most resistant. conclusion: the results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == antibacterial effects and physical properties of glass-ionomer cements containing chlorhexidine for the art approach.
AB  == objectives: since atraumatic restorative treatment (art) involves removal of carious lesions with manual instruments, improvement of filling materials to guarantee greater success should be considered. this study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, physical, and bonding properties of glass-ionomer cements (gic) containing chlorhexidine (chx), and to determine optimal concentrations for incorporation of agents to obtain antibacterial gics for use with the art approach. methods: chx diacetate combined with chx dihydrochloride was added to control gic powder to obtain concentration ratios of 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 1/1, or 2/2%  w/w. antibacterial activity of each cement against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei or actinomyces naeslundii was examined using agar-diffusion methods, and release of chx was analyzed by hplc. compressive strength, bond strength to dentin, and setting time were measured, and compared with those of control samples. results: all experimental gics exhibited inhibition of three bacteria, but sizes of inhibition zones and concentrations of chx released were not dependent upon chx content. incorporation of chx diacetate at 2% or greater,  significantly decreased compressive strength, and bond strength to dentin was adversely affected by addition of chx diacetate at 2% or more (p<0.05, anova, fisher's plsd test), although setting time was extended a little by addition of any concentrations of chx. significance: the present results demonstrate that experimental gics containing chx are effective in inhibiting bacteria associated  with caries, and incorporation of 1% chx diacetate is optimal to give appropriate physical and bonding properties.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of clearfil protect bond.
AB  == objectives: this study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of a commercially available self-etching adhesive system, clearfil  protect bond, which contains antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb). methods: inhibitory effects against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, or actinomyces naeslundii were examined by an agar-disc diffusion method using the clearfil protect bond primer  containing 5% mdpb and an acidic adhesion-promoting monomer mdp, the primer only  with mdp, and the primer with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (mic/mbc) of each primer for the three bacterial species were determined by serial microdilution assays. for testing the bactericidal effects seen in dentin, the primer was applied to demineralized dentin blocks in which s. mutans had been impregnated, and numbers of viable bacteria were counted. results: for all three bacteria, the sizes of the inhibition zones produced by clearfil protect bond primer were significantly greater than for the other primers (p<0.05, anova and scheffe's f-test). the mic/mbc values of clearfil protect bond primer were less than those of the primer without mdpb, and comparable to those of the primer containing cetylpyridinium chloride. no bacterial recovery was obtained after application of clearfil protect bond primer to the bacteria-impregnated dentin, although the primer without mdpb showed some bactericidal effect. significance: clearfil protect bond primer has strong antibacterial activity based upon mdpb against s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii, and the capability to disinfect cavities containing residual bacteria.

TI  == salivary actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  == background: gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. methods: to test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also  associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. the study population consisted of 297 predominantly african- american women who were pregnant for the first time. the salivary bacterial levels evaluated were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. results: for 1 unit increase in log(10) a. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; se = 29.1; p = 0.04), and a 0.17  week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; se = 0.09; p = 0.05). in contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) l. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; se = 19.3; p = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; se = 0.06; p = 0.04). conclusions: we conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. these organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.

TI  == in situ and non-invasive detection of specific bacterial species in oral biofilms using fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == noninvasive in situ detection of suspected cariogenic bacterial species within dental biofilms could facilitate monitoring of the dynamic change of oral microbial flora and assist in the assessment of the treatment efficacy of therapeutic agents. in this study, we explore the possibility to use three well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and lactobacillus casei to identify these three important members of the oral microbial community in the complex environment of oral biofilms. these mabs, which were conjugated to different fluorescent labels and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), proved to be an useful tool to identify the three species of interest (s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l.  casei) under various experimental conditions including in vitro and in vivo derived oral biofilms. manifold addition of the mabs on consecutive days did not  alter the biofilm structure thus allowing monitoring of the same biofilm over extended time periods. using this mab-based method the effect of sucrose challenge on the biofilm composition and the distribution of s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l. casei were examined. s. mutans was found to be the predominant species under the various biofilm conditions tested. these studies indicate that  mabs based bacterial detection with clsm is a versatile tool which permits new insights into the ecology of oral biofilm development.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of a dentin conditioner combined with antibacterial agents.
AB  == dental hand instruments are not efficient in removing all infected dentin when performing carious removal for minimal intervention techniques. the use of an antibacterial dentin conditioner may therefore be useful when restoring cavities  that have residual carious dentin. antibacterial agents--chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, benzaikonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite, were added either to a dentin conditioner used for glass ionomer cements or distilled water at 1% concentration. dentin conditioning solutions at ph 2.5, 4.9 and 7.7 were also prepared, along with 1% aqueous thymol. using an agar diffusion test, 25 microl aliquots were examined for their  inhibitory effects on three cariogenic bacteria. after 24 hours, an agar pellet was extracted adjacent to the agar well and placed on a second inoculated agar plate to observe sustained inhibitory effects, after which this procedure was repeated one more time. antibacterial dentin conditioners showed significant inhibitory effect compared to the control over the three test periods (p<0.016).  the combination of dentin conditioners with antibacterial agents significantly reduced the inhibitory effect compared to the antibacterial aqueous solutions (p<0.016). one-percent aqueous thymol showed no inhibitory effect against the test bacteria. the cetrimide-dentin conditioner showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all three test bacteria over the three experimental periods (p<0.016). the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents was significantly reduced when combined with a dentin conditioner. only the cetrimide-dentin conditioner combination produced significant inhibitory effects against all three test organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

TI  == xylitol inhibition of acid production and growth of mutans streptococci in the presence of various dietary sugars under strictly anaerobic conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of xylitol on the  growth of and acid production by mutans streptococci in the presence of various dietary sugars, and the relationship between the inhibition and the accumulation  of xylitol 5-phosphate (x5p) under strictly anaerobic conditions like those in the deep layers of dental plaque. xylitol retarded the growth of mutans streptococci in the presence of glucose (g), galactose (gal), maltose (m), lactose (l) or sucrose (s) as an energy source, though the inhibition of growth on fructose (fr) was small. xylitol inhibited acid production by washed cells of  streptococci mutans from g, gal, m, l or s (12-83% inhibition). s. mutans accumulated x5p intracellularly through activity of the phosphoenolpyruvate-xylitol phosphotransferase system (pep-xylitol pts) when they fermented these sugars in the presence of xylitol. however, in the presence of fr, no inhibition of acid production was observed. in addition, the amounts of x5p during the fermentation of fr were smaller than those of other sugars in spite of the presence of pep-xylitol pts activity. these results suggest that along with the intracellular accumulation of x5p, xylitol decreases the growth and acid production of mutans streptococci in the presence of various dietary sugars except fr.

AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha and beta-defensin-2 stimulate dentin sialophosphoprotein gene expression in human pulp cells.
AB  == macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3alpha and beta-defensin (bd)-2 have antimicrobial activity and chemotactic activity for immature dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and memory t cells. however, it remains unknown if the widespread effects of these peptides also include an influence on the differentiation of mesenchymal cells. pulp cells have the capacity to differentiate into odontoblasts and to form dentin. the aim of this study was to  determine if inflammatory leukocyte products influence the capacity of pulp cells to differentiate. dentin sialophosphoprotein (dspp) is a tooth-specific protein being expressed mostly by odontoblast cells. in the present study, we investigated effects of mip-3alpha and bd-2 on the dspp and osteopontin (opn) gene expression in cultures of human pulp-derived fibroblastic cells (hp cells).  hp cells expressed mrna for the cc chemokine receptor (ccr) 6 to which both mip-3alpha and bd-2 can bind. real-time pcr showed that mip-3alpha and bd-2 significantly increased dspp mrna levels, although bd-2 increased dspp mrna levels less than mip-3alpha. mip-3alpha and bd-2 increased opn mrna levels very slightly. mip-3alpha and bd-2 possessed antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei, which are involved in caries, although the antibacterial activity of mip-3alpha was lower than that of bd-2. these findings suggest the mip-3alpha and bd-2 have the ability to stimulate odontoblast differentiation in addition to their more traditional role in inflammation and have potential in the removal of bacteria in infected soft dentin and pulp tissues.

TI  == comparison of antibacterial activity of simplified adhesive systems.
AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the intrinsic antibacterial activity of commercially available simplified adhesive systems. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of five self-etching/priming one-step adhesives and three  priming/bonding adhesives against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and  actinomyces viscosus was assessed by the agar disc-diffusion test and determination of the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). twenty microl of each adhesive was impregnated into a paper disc and placed on an agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension, with or without light-irradiation. the size of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of incubation. the mic values were measured by serial microdilution assays, visually examining the growth of bacteria after incubation  with each adhesive for 24-48 hours. the subcultures were made on bhi agar plates  from the wells showing no visible growth of bacteria, and the mbc values were determined based on production of colonies. two primers in two-step self-etching  systems and an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine were tested for reference. the results of disc-diffusion tests were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test. results: the size of inhibition zones produced by adhesives varied among the brands. none of the available commercial adhesives showed significant inhibition against all three of the bacterial species tested. light-irradiation reduced the size of inhibition zones for a few materials, but a similar trend to the effectiveness of non-irradiated specimens was observed. the  antibacterial activity of commercial products determined in terms of mic/mbc values were different from the results by disc-diffusion tests. the self-etching  adhesives with low ph were not necessarily more effective than priming/bonding solutions, and no significant relationships between the acidity and antibacterial effects were found. compared with commercial products, an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine produced significantly larger inhibition zones against all species (p < 0.05) and exhibited greater bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity, demonstrating lower mic/mbc values.

TI  == inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  == the objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (gic). this was assessed using an agar diffusion test. chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to fuji  ix gic at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. antibacterial-gic specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (streptococcis, lactobacillus, and actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. the experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. control specimens of the gic produced no bacterial inhibition. the antibacterial-gic combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on  week 1. ct-gic showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. the addition of antibacterial agents to fuji ix creates a gic material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.

TI  == effects of nitrite and nitrate on the growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == it is hypothesised that exogenous nitrite acidified by metabolic products of acidogenic bacteria in the mouth will be converted to products which inhibit growth of the bacteria in question which contribute to dental caries. objectives: the aims of this study were (1) to test the activity of both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite at differing concentrations on the ability of streptococcus mutans to lower the ph of its surroundings and hence (2) to determine whether either nitrate or nitrite might be bactericidal or bacteriostatic against s. mutans. methods: s. mutans nctc 10449(t) was cultured in a liquid medium to which either  sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to a final concentration of 0.0, 0.2,  2.0, 20 or 200 mm, of which the first acted as a test substance negative control. after 24 h, the cultures were streaked onto agar to test for growth and the remaining culture used for ph measurement. the mann-whitney u-test was used for statistical comparison of ph values. results: nitrite at concentrations of 20 and 200 mm had a highly significant inhibitory effect (p < 0.001) on the ability of s. mutans nctc 10449(t) to lower ph. moreover, bacteria that had been subjected to these levels of nitrite were unable to recover on solid medium. nitrate had no such effect on either the growth of the bacteria or on their ability to lower ph. conclusions: it is concluded that nitrite, at final concentrations of either 20 or 200 mm, is both bactericidal and anti-acidogenic with respect to s. mutans, while lower concentrations of nitrite and all concentrations of nitrate are ineffective. nitrite might be worthy of consideration as a mouth-rinse constituent.

TI  == in situ delivery of passive immunity by lactobacilli producing single-chain antibodies.
AB  == lactobacilli have previously been used to deliver vaccine components for active immunization in vivo. vectors encoding a single-chain fv (scfv) antibody fragment, which recognizes the streptococcal antigen i/ii (sai/ii) adhesion molecule of streptococcus mutans, were constructed and expressed in lactobacillus zeae (american type culture collection (atcc) 393). the scfv antibody fragments secreted into the supernatant or expressed on the surface of the bacteria showed  binding activity against sai/ii in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), and surface scfv-expressing lactobacilli agglutinated sai/ii-expressing s. mutans in  vitro without affecting the corresponding sai/ii knockout strain. lactobacilli expressing the scfv fragment fused to an e-tag were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) using beads coated with a monoclonal anti-e-tag antibody, and they bound directly to beads coated with sai/ii. after administration of scfv-expressing bacteria to a rat model of dental caries development, s. mutans bacteria counts and caries scores were markedly reduced. as lactobacilli are generally regarded as safe (gras) microorganisms, this approach may be of considerable commercial interest for in vivo immunotherapy.

TI  == penetration of an antibacterial dentine-bonding system into demineralized human root dentine in vitro.
AB  == in this study, the penetration of three proprietary dentine-bonding agents (prime & bond 2.1, single bond, liner bond 2) and experimental dentine-bonding systems incorporating an antibacterial monomer, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb), into artificial root caries lesions was evaluated, and the bactericidal activity of each material against streptococcus mutans or lactobacillus casei impregnated into demineralized dentine blocks was assessed. all of the commercial dentine-bonding agents were capable of penetrating into the artificial carious lesions to more than 150 microm. the depth of penetration of the experimental systems, which were based on liner bond 2, was not significantly different from that of their parent product. liner bond 2 primer exhibited the greatest bactericidal effects among the three proprietary dentine-bonding agents  tested. bactericidal activities of experimental primers containing mdpb were greater than those of any other products, and the application of 4% mdpb-containing primer resulted in complete killing of bacteria in demineralized  dentine. the results indicate that the penetration of dentine-bonding agents into extensively demineralized root dentine is possible in vitro, and the experimental dentine-bonding systems containing the antibacterial monomer mdpb are capable of  killing bacteria within demineralized dentine. this could be of benefit when managing root caries lesions.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == cytokine induction by streptococcus mutans and pulpal pathogenesis.
AB  == chronic pulpal inflammation under caries appears to be elicited by bacterial antigens that diffuse into the pulp through dentinal tubules. this prompted the hypothesis that cytokines elicited by antigens from streptococcus mutans, which frequently dominates shallow lesions, could play a major role in eliciting the initial t-cell response in the pulp. to test this, we examined the ability of s.  mutans to stimulate t cells and elicit cytokines and used lactobacillus casei, which often predominates in deep carious lesions where b cells and plasma cells predominate, as a control. in addition, the presence of cytokines in the pulp was analyzed at the mrna level. s. mutans elicited potent gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and reduced the cd4/cd8 ratio by promoting cd8(+) t cells. multiple inflammatory cytokine mrnas (ifn-gamma, interleukin 4 [il-4], and il-10) were detected in human dental  pulp. a higher prevalence of ifn-gamma (67%) than il-4 (19%) or il-10 (29%) was obtained in shallow caries, suggesting a type 1 cytokine mechanism in early pulpitis where s. mutans predominates. in contrast, in deep caries no differences in cytokine frequency were observed. furthermore, the presence of ifn-gamma in the pulp correlated with the presence of s. mutans. the extraordinary induction of type 1 cytokines and the preferential activation of cd8(+) t cells by s. mutans offers an explanation for the etiology of the cd8(+) t-cell-dominant lesion in early pulpitis and suggests that s. mutans may have a major impact on the initial lesion and pulpal pathology.

TI  == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces naeslundii. whereas the growth of s. mutans was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after 24 h of exposure. similar effects were observed with a. naeslundii and l. casei. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also markedly affected by nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 7, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of s. mutans, with similar effects on the other organisms tested. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva has an effect on the growth and survival of cariogenic bacteria.

AB  == dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a congenital disorder characterized by blistering of the skin and oral mucosa. this study investigated the hypothesis that children with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa have impaired oral secretory  immunity. immunoglobulin a (iga), secretory iga and igg concentrations, and iga and secretory iga antibody levels to candida albicans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mutans were measured in whole saliva from 22 children with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and 22 matched controls. salivary total iga and  total igg concentrations were significantly raised in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa due to serum leakage from oral blistering, but the converse was seen with secretory iga. this suggestion of a mucosal immune defect was supported by decreased secretory iga antibody responses to all three microorganisms tested. this apparent defect in secretory immunity in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa may be due to mucosal involvement and damage resulting in impaired antigen sampling in mucosal associated lymphoid tissue or to impaired transport of secretory iga across the salivary gland mucosa.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of an essential oil and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse in vitro.
AB  == although laboratory studies are not necessarily predictive of clinical activity;  they can help to elucidate mechanisms underlying clinical activity when the latter has been established. in a recent clinical study, an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine antiseptic) was shown to be significantly more effective than an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse (meridol) in inhibiting supragingival plaque formation. this paper reports the results of laboratory studies comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of these 2 mouthrinses using a  kill kinetics assay and a plaque biofilm kill assay. in both assays, the essential oil mouthrinse was considerably more effective than the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse. these findings are consistent with the results of the clinical trial and may help to explain the observed differences in clinical activity.

AB  == purpose: this study compares four chemotherapeutic regimens used for inhibiting carious lesion progression: silver nitrate (agno3); silver fluoride/stannous fluoride (agf/snf2); silver diammine fluoride (sdf); and chlorhexidine (chx). methods: for this study, a bacterial model system containing mutans streptococci  (ms) and lactobacilli casei (l) was used to generate carious lesions on 85 extracted sound permanent third molars which were randomly assigned to four test  groups and one control group. at week two, the four treatment regimens were applied to the lesions (one treatment per test group). results: six weeks later,  lesions treated with a single agf/snf2 or agno3 application demonstrated 29% and  19% less lesion progression, respectively, than did the control group (p < 0.05). sdf and chx did not differ significantly from the control. conclusion: agf/snf2 and agno3 may be useful in slowing down carious lesion depth progression.

TI  == regulated expression of the streptococcus mutans dlt genes correlates with intracellular polysaccharide accumulation.
AB  == intracellular polysaccharides (ips) are glycogen-like storage polymers which contribute significantly to streptococcus mutans-induced cariogenesis. we previously identified and cloned a locus from the s. mutans chromosome which is required for the accumulation of ips. sequencing of this locus revealed at least  four contiguous open reading frames, all of which are preceded by a common promoter region and are transcribed in the same direction. analysis of the amino  acid sequence deduced from the first of these open reading frames (orf1) revealed domains which are highly conserved among d-alanine-activating enzymes (dlta) in lactobacillus rhamnosus (formerly lactobacillus casei) and bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequences derived from orf2, -3, and -4 also exhibit extensive similarity to dltb, -c, and -d, respectively, in these microorganisms. however, southern hybridization experiments indicate that this operon maps to a locus on the s. mutans chromosome which is separate from the glgp, glga, and glgd genes, whose products are known mediators of bacterial ips accumulation. we therefore assigned a new dlt designation to the locus which we had formerly called glg. we  maintain that the dlt genes are involved in s. mutans ips accumulation, however,  since they complement a mutation in trans which otherwise renders s. mutans ips deficient. in this study, we found that expression of the s. mutans dlt genes is  growth phase dependent and is modulated by carbohydrates internalized via the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). we demonstrated that the s.  mutans dlt genes are expressed constitutively when non-pts sugars are provided as the sole source of carbohydrate. consistent with a role for the pts in dlt expression is a similar constitutive expression of the dlt genes in an s. mutans  pts mutant grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented with glucose. in summary, these findings support a novel role for the dlt gene products in s. mutans ips accumulation and suggest that dlt expression in this oral pathogen is  subject to complex mechanisms of control imposed by growth phase, dietary carbohydrate, and other factors present in the plaque environment.

TI  == antibacterial activity of proprietary self-etching primers.
AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the in vitro antibacterial activity of three self-etching primers. materials and methods: lb primer (liner bond 2), fb primer  (fluoro bond), and mb conditioner (tokuso mac bond) were evaluated. the antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces viscosus was assessed using the agar disc-diffusion method. twenty microliters of each primer were impregnated into a paper disc and placed on a brain heart infusion agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension. the size  of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of  incubation of the plate. in addition, 20 microliters of each primer was added to  a 1 ml suspension of s. mutans adjusted to 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(5), or 1 x 10(4) cfu/ml in phosphate buffered saline and kept in contact for 30 seconds. the number of viable bacteria after contact with each primer was determined. the results were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test (p < 0.05). results: lb primer and fb primer produced inhibition zones against s. mutans and a. viscosus, and mb conditioner produced an inhibition zone only against a. viscosus. no inhibition zones were produced by any of the primers against l. casei. the three  primers completely killed 1 x 10(4) cfu of s. mutans within 30 seconds of contact. when 1 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(6) cfu of bacterial cells were kept in contact, significant differences in the number of recovered viable cells were found among  the three primers with mb conditioner being the most bactericidal. lb primer had  little bactericidal activity and the mean reduction of viable bacteria by fb primer and mb conditioner was approximately 30% and 65%, respectively.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == subtraction radiography of dentinal caries-like lesions induced in vitro by cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: the objective of this project was to develop an in vitro model system for investigations of dentinal caries. methods: five extracted primary molar teeth with circular cavity preparations to the depth of the dentinoenamel junction were mounted individually in cold-cure acrylic bases constructed to fit  a positioning jig in a schick-technologies digital radiographic imaging apparatus. the mounted teeth (mt) were incubated with pure cultures of streptococcus mutans for 7 days and lactobacillus casei for 38 days. at baseline  and on day 23 and 45, four digital radiographs of each mt were made. subtraction  radiography was performed and analyzed using custom interactive software. results: lesions progressed roughly halfway through the dentin in all teeth at 23 days and approximated the pulp chambers at 45 days of incubation. images resulting from subtraction procedures clearly revealed incremental caries progression which could be quantitated. conclusion: the model may be useful for screening cariostatic dental materials or treatments and investigating microbial  mechanisms in dentinal caries.

AB  == the binding specificities of streptococcus glucosyltransferase (gtf) b, c and d for hydroxyapatite (ha), saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha), and bacterial surfaces were examined. for ha beads the following values were obtained: (k = affinity; n = number of binding sites) gtfb, k = 46 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.65 x  10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 86 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 4.42 x 10(-6) mumol/m2.; gtfd, k = 100 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.83 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. for sha beads, the following values were obtained: gtfb, k = 14.7 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 1.03 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 21.3 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 3.66 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfd, k = 1.73 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 8.88 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. the binding of gtfb  to sha beads was reduced in the presence of parotid saliva, but the binding of gtfc and d was unaffected. the binding of gtfb to sha in the presence of parotid  saliva supplemented with gtfc and d was reduced when compared with its binding to sha in the presence of parotid saliva alone. in contrast, te binding of gtfc and  sha was unaffected when parotid saliva was supplemented with the other gtf enzymes. gtfb bound to several bacterial strains (strep, mutans gs-5, actinomyces viscosus omz105e and lactobacillus casei 4646) in an active form, while gtfc and  d did not bind to bacterial surfaces. it is concluded that of the three gtf enzymes, gtfc has the highest affinity for ha and sha surfaces and can adsorb on  the the sha surface in the presence of the other two enzymes. gtfd also binds to  sha in the presence of the other enzymes but has a very low affinity for the surface. gtfb does not bind to sha in the presence of the other gtf enzymes but binds avidly to bacterial surfaces in an active form. therefore, gtfc most probably binds to apatitic surfaces, while gtfb binds to bacterial surfaces.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentine primer containing mdpb after curing.
AB  == objectives: a monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) has antibacterial activity before polymerization. furthermore, the antibacterial agent is immobilized by the polymerization of mdpb and the resin-based material incorporating mdpb is able to show an antibacterial effect even after being cured. the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of a dentine primer containing mdpb after curing. methods: the inhibitory effect of a  cured mdpb-containing primer on the growth of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus casei was determined by the agar-disc method. the bactericidal activity of cured primer during a 1-h contact period was assessed using s. mutans, and the elution of unpolymerized mdpb was measured with high performance liquid chromatography. results: cured mdpb-containing primer showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of all species which were in contact with the  specimen surface, and displayed a little bactericidal effect on s. mutans without releasing any unpolymerized antibacterial components. conclusion: incorporation of antibacterial monomer mdpb into dentine primer is beneficial for providing antibacterial activity after curing.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == ecological study of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus spp. at sub-sites from approximal dental plaque from children.
AB  == previous immunofluorescence (if) studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans may preferentially colonise specific sub-sites within approximal plaque. the present study aimed to extend these observations to other mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in such gingival margin plaque. two hundred and seventy approximal plaque samples were taken from 90 teeth (3 from each tooth) in 64 children; three gingival margin sub-sites in relation to the contact area: away from (a), to the  side of(s) and below (b) the contact area. samples were processed by indirect if  using high-titred polyclonal anti-s. mutans 'c', anti-s. sobrinus 'd', anti-l. casei and anti-l. acidophilus antisera. an overall positive association was found between s. mutans 'c' and s. sobrinus 'd' (p < 0.001). significant differences (p < 0.1) were found between the proportional counts at each sub-site for s. mutans  'c': a = 39%, s = 51% and b = 70%, and for s. sobrinus 'd' 21, 33 and 49%. mutans streptococci (ms) appeared to preferentially colonise the sub-site below the contact area (b = 81%), compared with sub-sites a and s (48 and 62%, respectively). s. mutans 'c' and s. sobrinus 'd' were detected together at subsites a = 12%, s = 22%, and b = 38%, with proportional counts at b sites being higher than those at a (b > a, p < 0.01, and b > s, p < 0.05). lactobacillus spp. were isolated rarely, and were usually found together with ms. there was a positive relationship between the presence of lactobacilli or ms and caries (white spot lesions only), although these species could frequently be isolated from noncarious sites. the presence of both s. mutans 'c' and s. sobrinus 'd' were strongly correlated with early caries lesions. in addition, this study confirmed the variation in the microflora at different sub-sites within approximal dental plaque.

TI  == anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  == in the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different gram-positive bacteria. it inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/ml which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. it functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. the antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against  both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

AB  == the polymerizable monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) shows antibacterial activity when immobilized in a resin-based material. in this study, the antibacterial effect of a dentin primer incorporating mdpb was investigated.  the influence of incorporation of mdpb on bond strength to dentin and on the curing performance of the adhesive system was also evaluated. experimental primers were prepared by addition of mdpb into a proprietary primer at 1, 2, or 5%. antibacterial effects of experimental primers were compared with those of control primer and two other proprietary primers by an agar disc-diffusion method and bactericidal activity test. experimental primers produced greater inhibition  zones against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei than any of three proprietary primers, and inhibition increased as the concentration of mdpb was increased. bactericidal activity of mdpb-containing primers against streptococcus mutans was greater than those of the other three primers, with incorporation of mdpb at 5% showing complete killing of bacteria after 30 s contact. no decrease in tensile bond strength was observed for materials containing mdpb. on the contrary, the primer incorporating 1 and 2% mdpb showed higher bond strength than all the others, including the control (p <  0.05). when the degree of conversion of the complex of primer and adhesive resin  was determined with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, there were no significant differences between any of the experimental primers and the control (p > 0.05). these results indicate that incorporation of the antibacterial monomer mdpb enhanced the antibacterial effect of a proprietary dentin primer before curing, and had no adverse influence on bond strength to dentin and curing of the adhesive system.

TI  == the lac operon of lactobacillus casei contains lact, a gene coding for a protein  of the bg1g family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  == the 5' region of the lac operon of lactobacillus casei has been investigated. an  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lact, was identified upstream of lace. the gene product encoded by lact is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes bglg from escherichia coli, arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, sact, sacy, and lict from bacillus subtilis, and bglr from lactococcus lactis. amino acid sequence identities range  from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. the transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lact. the corresponding mrna would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus rna binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. lact was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a b. subtilis test system using the sacb target sequence. lact directly precedes lacegf, the genes coding for enzyme iicb, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme iia, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. northern hybridizations  with probes against lact, lace, and lacf revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mrnas of several l. casei strains. since the length of the lac mrna is just sufficient to contain lactegf, we conclude that the lac operon of l. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == rapid procedure for acid adaptation of oral lactic-acid bacteria and further characterization of the response.
AB  == acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. the response of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was induced in a progressive  rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the ph of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. the weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta ph or  the proton motive force across the cell membrane. transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at ph 5. streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. the rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.

AB  == secondary caries is a major reason for the replacement of restorations. because it is hypothesized that the development of secondary caries is closely associated with pathogenic oral bacteria, an in vitro microbial model has been developed to  produce secondary carious lesions. a mixture of overnight cultures of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei in dextrose-free trypticase soy broth, supplemented with 5% sucrose (tsbs), at 37 degrees c was used in this model as the inoculum for the experimental groups. uninoculated control groups were incubated with medium only. groups of human tooth specimens restored using composite, together with their respective controls, were exposed for 7 or 12 days to circulating cycles of tsbs (30 min each, 3 times per day) and a mineral wash solution (for a total of 22.5 h per day), at 37 degrees c. the ph of the experimental groups dropped to 4.l-4.5 during the test periods. the ph of the control groups remained at 6.8-7.0. the inoculated bacteria remained viable throughout the study. no contamination of experimental or control samples occurred. laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated the development of incipient surface and wall lesions in all the specimens of experimental groups in as few as 7 days. reproducibility of the model was confirmed in a second investigation. therefore, it was concluded that this model can be used for studying the microbial etiology and prevention of secondary caries.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == the effect of environmental ph and fluoride from the substratum on the development of biofilms of selected oral bacteria.
AB  == the present study was initiated to answer the question, "does fluoride from the substratum influence the accumulation of bacterial cells in an associated biofilm?" 'fluoride-bound hydroxyapatite' (fha) and 'fluoride-free hydroxyapatite' (ha) rods were prepared as test and control surfaces, respectively. biofilms of s. mutans bm71, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 wvu627, and l. casei bm225 accumulated on the surfaces of rods in a semi-defined, mucin-based medium in a chemostat. culture conditions were varied from ph 4.5 to 7.0 under carbon (glucose) limitation and excess, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1. low environmental ph reduced both the numbers of cells on ha surfaces during the early phases (from 0 to 2 h) of accumulation and the final numbers of cells in mature biofilms (20 h). the initial adherence of cells was unaffected by surface  fluoride under any of the conditions tested. similarly, biofilm cells under carbon limitation and those under carbon excess at ph 7.0 were not affected by surface fluoride. however, at low environmental ph values, ph 5.5 for s. mutans and ph 6.0 for a. naeslundii under glucose excess, the accumulation of biofilm cells on the fha surfaces was significantly reduced (p < 0.05-0.001). biofilm cell number doubling times of s. mutans and a. naeslundii were increased on fha relative to ha. biofilms of l. casei were not significantly affected, even at ph  4.5 in glucose excess. the results confirmed that fluoride from the substratum affected fluoride-sensitive biofilm cells but only under conditions of glucose excess ad low ph.

TI  == killing of cariogenic bacteria by light from a gallium aluminium arsenide diode laser.
AB  == suspensions of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus were exposed to light from a gallium aluminium arsenide laser in the presence of aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine and the numbers of survivors determined. exposure to the laser light in the absence of the dye, or the dye in the absence of the laser light, had no significant effect on the viability of the organisms. however, a light-dose-related decrease in the viable  count of all four target organisms was found on exposure to the laser light in the presence of the dye. the kills attributable to lethal photosensitization amounted to approximately 10(6) cfu in the case of each organisms. as appreciable kills were achieved within clinically convenient exposure times (30-90 s), these  results imply that lethal photosensitization may be a useful technique for eliminating bacteria from carious lesions prior to restoration.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequencing of l-lactate dehydrogenase gene from streptococcus thermophilus m-192.
AB  == the gene encoding l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of streptococcus thermophilus m-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have  high sequence similarity to ldhs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to lactobacillus casei, and 60% to lactobacillus plantarum). the gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the s. thermophilus ldh gene was observed in e. coli cells.

TI  == an in vitro model for adhesion of bacteria to human tooth root surfaces.
AB  == a model mimicking bacterial colonization of dentine has been developed. it employs uniform particles of pulverized human tooth root tissue incubated with radioactively labelled bacteria. after incubation, the number of attaching bacteria is quantified. attachment of streptococcus mutans ua140, actinomyces viscosus t14, and lactobacillus casei 101 was found to be time dependent and complete within 1-3 h. dissociation constants (kd) of the interactions equalled 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.6 x 10(8) cells/ml, for strep. mutants and a. viscosus, respectively. the kd for l. casei could not be determined as attachment was not saturable. the putative tissue components involved in adherence were studied by determining the attachment of bacteria in the presence of competing strains. the  results suggest that strep. mutans and a. viscosus recognized and competed for the same ligand (probably collagen) in the dentine. l. casei attachment did not complete with the attachment of strep. mutans and a. viscosus. attachment of all  strains was modified by preincubation with saliva and varied with bacterial strain and saliva donor.

TI  == characteristics of accumulation of oral gram-positive bacteria on mucin-conditioned glass surfaces in a model system.
AB  == strains of streptococcus, actinomyces and lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (ph 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. the accumulation of cells followed four phases. in phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (cdt) streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): cdt streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. the biofilm stabilized in phase 4, cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. the numbers  (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and lactobacillus, 2.77.  accumulation increased (cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.

TI  == isolation, characterization and nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus mutans lactose-specific enzyme ii (lace) gene of the pts and the phospho-beta-galactosidase (lacg) gene.
AB  == the lace and lacg genes from streptococcus mutans have been isolated and characterized, and their nucleotide sequence has been determined. the lace gene encodes the lactose-specific enzyme ii component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts). the lacg gene encodes the phospho-beta-galactosidase which cleaves the lactose phosphate that is formed by the lactose pts. the s. mutans lace and lacg genes are located in the same operon as the tagatose genes. s. mutans metabolizes lactose via the tagatose phosphate pathway. the deduced lace and lacg proteins of s. mutans display high homology with the corresponding proteins from lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus casei.

AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == sensitisation of cariogenic bacteria to killing by light from a helium-neon laser.
AB  == suspensions of the cariogenic bacteria streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus were exposed to light from a 7.3-mw  helium-neon laser in the presence of toluidine blue o. a substantial killing rate (c. 10(6) cfu) of all four species was achieved with a dye concentration of 50 micrograms/ml and a light energy dose of 33.6 j/cm2. this was achieved in 60 s, an exposure time that is clinically acceptable. exposure to laser light in the absence of the dye did not significantly affect the viability of any of the organisms. this approach may be useful in dentistry to sterilise a carious lesion prior to its repair.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacr, lacabcd, and lacfe genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of lacrabcdf and partial nucleotide sequence of lace from the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans are presented. comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. the deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of lactobacillus casei. additionally, lacr has sequence homology with the repressor (deor) of the escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while lacc is similar to phosphokinases (fruk and pfkb) from e. coli. the primary translation products of the lacrabcdfe genes are  polypeptides of 251 (m(r) 28,713), 142 (m(r) 15,610), 171 (m(r) 18,950), 310 (m(r) 33,368), 325 (m(r) 36,495), 104 (m(r) 11,401), and 123 (nh2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. as inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (lacr), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (laca and lacb), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacc), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (lacd), and the sugar-specific components enzyme iii-lactose (lacf) and enzyme ii-lactose (lace) of the s. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.  the nucleotide sequence encompassing the s. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of s. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.

TI  == comparative acid tolerances and inhibitor sensitivities of isolated f-atpases of  oral lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == ph activity profiles and inhibitor sensitivities were compared for membrane atpases isolated from three oral lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, streptococcus mutans gs-5, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, with, respectively, high, moderate, and low levels of acid tolerance. membranes containing f1f0 atpases were isolated by means of salt lysis of cells treated with muralytic enzymes. membrane-free f1f0 complexes were then isolated from membranes by detergent extraction with triton x-100 or octylglucoside. finally, f1 complexes free of the proton-conducting f0 sector were obtained by washing membranes with buffers of low ionic strength. the ph activity profiles of the membrane-associated enzymes reflected the general acid tolerances of the organisms from which they were isolated; for example, ph optima were approximately 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0, respectively, for enzymes from l. casei, s. mutans, and s. sanguis. roughly similar profiles were found for membrane-free f1f0 complexes, which were stabilized by phospholipids against loss of activity during storage. however, profiles for f1 enzymes were distinctly narrower, indicating that association with f0 and possibly other membrane components enhanced tolerance to both acid and alkaline media. all of the enzymes were found to have similar sensitivities to al-f complexes, but only f1f0 enzymes were highly sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. the procedures described for isolation of membrane-free f1f0 forms of the enzymes from oral lactic acid bacteria will be of use in future studies of the characteristics of the enzymes,  especially in studies with liposomes.

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine added to glass-ionomer cements.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to investigate the antibacterial properties of glass-ionomer cements containing different concentrations of chlorhexidine and the possible release of chlorhexidine from the compound. chlorhexidine gluconate  or diacetate was mixed with glass-ionomer cements and tested in vitro against strains of lactobacillus casei and mutans streptococci. a spectrophotometric test was used to monitor the release of chlorhexidine from the mixture. in a broth culture test, the higher the concentrations of chlorhexidine in the mixture, the  longer the time of antibacterial effect on streptococcus mutans and the greater the tendency of the material to deteriorate. agar diffusion tests revealed bacterial inhibition in a dose-response manner. the tested bacterial strains were similarly inhibited and the antibacterial properties decreased with time. a minor portion of added chlorhexidine was released from the cement. the deterioration of the cements indicates that the material could be useful as a varnish-like chlorhexidine carrier.

AB  == streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus and lactobacillus casei were grown in glucose-supplemented, sterilized, human whole saliva, adjusted to ph 5, 6 or 7. components of the antibacterial peroxidase system--hypothiocyanous acid (hoscn) and hypothiocyanite ions (oscn-)--were generated by adding exogenous h2o2 to sterilized saliva containing endogenous peroxidases and thiocyanate (scn-) ions.  hoscn/oscn- generation was proportional to the amount of h2o2 added, and more hoscn/oscn- was detected in saliva at ph 7 than at ph 5. however, the growth of mutans streptococci and l. casei was inhibited at ph 5 by hoscn/oscn-, whereas no inhibition was found at ph 7. the findings show that (a) sufficient amount of hoscn/oscn- will inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria in human saliva at ph  5; (b) this amount of hoscn/oscn- can be generated in saliva by exogenously added h2o2; and (c) peroxidase systems have stronger antistreptococcal effects in human whole saliva than in phosphate buffer.

TI  == sugar, fluoride, ph and microbial homeostasis in dental plaque.
AB  == factors that may contribute to the maintenance or breakdown of the oral microflora have been studied in the laboratory using a mixed culture chemostat system. carbohydrate type had relatively little influence of the proportions of individual species at neutral ph. in contrast, when the ph was allowed to fall following carbohydrate metabolism, the stability of the microflora was markedly perturbed. the proportions of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and veillonella dispar increased and they became the predominant species, while levels of other gram-negative organisms and s. gordonii declined. low levels (1 mmol/l) of sodium fluoride (naf) had little effect on the microflora at neutral ph. however, when the ph fell following carbohydrate metabolism, 1 mmol/l of naf  slowed acid production and, in so doing, reduced the inhibition of acid-sensitive species, and suppressed the selection of s. mutans under otherwise favourable conditions. these data (and others) suggest that the mode of action of fluoride in human beings might include a subtle but clinically significant antimicrobial effect. these findings have also led to the proposal of a modified hypothesis (the "ecological plaque hypothesis") to explain the role of the resident oral microflora in dental disease. the hypothesis also has implications for treatment  and prevention strategies.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dental gels containing combinations of amine fluoride,  stannous fluoride, and chlorhexidine against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus and lactobacillus casei to dental gels containing various combinations of amine fluoride (amf 297), stannous fluoride (snf2), and chlorhexidine (chx) was studied. the combination of amf-snf2 with a total fluoride content of 1.2% was the most effective against mutans streptococci but not against l. casei. at notably lower total fluoride concentration (0.4%), amf as such or combined with snf2, was significantly less effective against mutans streptococci than chx or chx-amf-snf2 combinations. chx-amf combination was a slightly more potent inhibitor of streptococcal growth than chx-naf. with l. casei the differences between various gels were small but chx alone seemed to be the most effective. of the studied agents, chx seemed to be the most potent individual chemotherapeutic  compound whose activity against s. mutans could be enhanced by combining it with  amf. however, clinical experiments are required to test the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chx-amf and amf-snf2 combinations which were most effective in our in vitro experiments.

AB  == one of the major effects of fluoride on oral bacteria is a reduction in acid tolerance, and presumably also in cariogenicity. the reduction appears to involve transport of protons across the cell membrane by the weak acid hf to dissipate the ph gradient, and also direct inhibition of the f1f0, proton-translocating atpases of the organisms, especially for streptococcus mutans. this direct inhibition by fluoride was found to be dependent on aluminum. the dependence on aluminum was indicated by the protection against fluoride inhibition afforded by  the al-chelator deferoxamine and by loss of protection after addition of umolar levels of al3+, which were not inhibitory for the enzyme in the absence of fluoride. the f1 form of the enzyme dissociated from the cell membrane previously had been found to be resistant to fluoride in comparison with the f1f0 membrane-associated form. however, this difference appeared to depend on less aluminum in the f1 preparation in that the sensitivity of the f1 enzyme to fluoride could be increased by addition of umolar levels of al3+. the effects of  al on fluoride inhibition were apparent when enzyme activity was assayed in terms of phosphate release from atp or with an atp-regenerating system containing phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, nadh and lactic dehydrogenase. also, be2+ but not other metal cations, e.g. co2+, fe2+, fe3+, mn2, sn2+, and zn2+, served to sensitize the enzyme to fluoride inhibition. the differences in sensitivities  of enzymes isolated from various oral bacteria found previously appeared also to  be related to differences in levels of al.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of ph on acid production from sorbitol in washed cell suspensions of oral  bacteria.
AB  == the acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces. the acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental ph 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. the metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. the results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. lowering the environmental ph decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the ph conditions. the total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. lactic acid,  which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. the ratio strong  (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. the present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.

TI  == a method for the identification of streptococcus mutans in gingival margin plaque by immunofluorescence.
AB  == a method was developed to identify streptococcus mutans in natural dental plaque  by indirect immunofluorescence staining, using a high-titred polyclonal antiserum raised against a serotype c strain of s. mutans followed by an fitc conjugate. specificity was determined by staining 45 representative strains of plaque organisms, which demonstrated minimal cross-reactions. in vitro incubation of s.  mutans nctc 10449 films with a human serum containing antibodies to s. mutans and the presence of extracellular polysaccharide did not inhibit staining. the staining method enabled 98% of the streptococci to be detected in mixtures of s.  mutans nctc 10449 and lactobacillus casei nctc 10302. s. mutans was detected at a ratio of 1:100,000 in mixtures of pure cultures. in plaque samples, s. mutans could be distinguished from other organisms, including an unidentified cross-reacting bacillus found in some gingival plaque samples. the results suggest that immunofluorescence is a fast, practical method for identifying specific bacteria in plaque and, therefore, could be of use in microbiological studies of caries.

TI  == some effects of ledermix paste and pulpdent paste on mouse fibroblasts and on bacteria in vitro.
AB  == dilutions of ledermix paste, pulpdent paste and a mixture of equal parts by weight of ledermix paste and pulpdent paste were added to in vitro cultures of mouse fibroblasts or bacteria for 24 h, and various cell functions were then examined: mitosis in and survival of fibroblasts, and survival of lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans. ledermix was found to reversibly inhibit mitosis while present in the concentrations range 10(-3) to 10(-6) mg/ml. mixing with pulpdent did not modify this antimitotic effect. ledermix killed mouse fibroblasts at 10(-3) mg/ml and above, while pulpdent killed at 1 mg/ml and above. the toxic effect of ledermix was slightly inhibited by mixing it with pulpdent. ledermix killed s. mutans at about the same concentration at which it killed the mammalian cells, but required a one thousand-fold greater concentration to kill l. casei. pulpdent killed both l. casei and s. mutans at approximately one-fifth of the concentration at which it killed the mammalian cells. pulpdent slightly potentiated the antibacterial effect of ledermix. the ph of pulpdent was reduced by approximately 0.3 units by mixing with ledermix. the present data showed that the 50:50 mix of ledermix and pulpdent retained the properties examined that are thought to be of therapeutic benefit, while not increasing the toxicity of the component parts to mammalian cells.

TI  == presence of mutans streptococci and various types of lactobacilli in interdental  spaces related to development of proximal carious lesions.
AB  == during a 2-yr study period samples from saliva, the tongue, and 276 interdental spaces were obtained from 23 7-yr-old children in order to (a) relate the presence of lactobacilli in various oral sites to the occurrence of lactobacilli  in saliva, and (b) relate the presence of mutans streptococci and various types of lactobacilli interdentally to the development of proximal carious lesions. the results showed an increased number of interdental samples containing lactobacilli with an increasing number of salivary lactobacilli. furthermore, lactobacilli were never found interdentally without the presence of mutans streptocci, lactobacilli proved to be the more suitable microorganism for prediction of proximal carious lesions. neither the number nor the differentiation into different species of interdental lactobacilli seemed to be of importance, but simply whether they were present. the presence of lactobacilli probably reflects  a caries-inducing environment (etiologic microflora + fermentable carbohydrates), thus explaining their high predictive ability compared to their rather limited etiologic importance in the initiation of decay.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == competition between streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei in mixed continuous culture.
AB  == in natural oral ecosystems, succession of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus  species occurs in bacterial communities which can be associated with the development of carious lesions. the objective of this study was to explore the interaction between 2 strains of s. mutans (sf2452) and lactobacillus casei (rb1014) when grown together in continuous culture under conditions of varying environmental ph and in the presence of fluoride. when the strains, isolated from approximal carious lesions, were grown initially at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1 under a glucose limitation at ph 7.0, a stable mixed community developed (days 5-10) with s. mutans as the dominant population. when the ph control was removed  (day 10), the binary culture lowered the ph to 5.1 causing a small reduction in the numbers of s. mutans and allowing l. casei to predominate. a more dramatic effect was seen when the environmental ph was rapidly lowered to 4.8 by the addition of acid. in this case, the s. mutans population was significantly reduced and the l. casei population rose to the level previously held by s. mutans. re-adjustment of the ph to 7.0 resulted in a re-establishment of the population ratios prior to the addition of acid. the possibility that s. mutans was capable of aciduric adaptation during a biologically-generated ph reduction was examined by mixing cultures of both organisms after each had been grown to steady state at ph 5.5 in separate chemostats.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

TI  == cariological assessment of leucrose [d-glucopyranosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] as a sugar substitute.
AB  == leucrose [d-glucosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] prepared by microbial-enzymatic transglycosidation from sucrose, is the first alpha(1----5)-linked disaccharide which possesses excellent nutritional properties with regard to metabolic utilization and is well tolerated. the aim of the present work was to assess its cariogenic potential. yeast invertase was shown to be inhibited by leucrose in a noncompetitive way, while hydrogenated leucrose (leucritol) acted as an activator. plaque polysaccharide forming glucosyltransferases from streptococcus cricetus aht were not influenced by leucrose, but by leucritol. essentially no acid formation was observed after incubation of leucrose with suspensions of human dental plaque, s. mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus casei lsb 132 and actinomyces viscosus ny 1 no. 30. leucrose was a competitive inhibitor of the acid formation from sucrose by s. mutans nctc  10449 at neutral ph. furthermore, leucrose inhibited at neutral ph considerably the uptake of sucrose by s. mutans nctc 10449. the uptake of fructose and maltose was also inhibited but that of glucose not at all. in cara rats as the animal model, leucrose was compared to sucrose and to corn starch for its cariogenic potential. in sharp contrast to the group fed with 30% sucrose, caries scores of  the 30% leucrose group were not significantly different from the starch group. ph telemetry with an indwelling electrode in man proved lueucrose to be 'safe for teeth' since plaque ph did not drop below ph 5.7. leucrose is a novel noncariogenic disaccharide and thus represents a highly promising sugar substitute for caries prevention.

TI  == degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == fluoride inhibition of proton-translocating atpases of oral bacteria.
AB  == the atpases of isolated membranes of lactic acid bacteria were found to be inhibited by fluoride in a complex manner. among the enzymes tested, that of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was the most sensitive to fluoride, and the initial rate of hydrolysis of atp was reduced 50% by approximately 3 mm fluoride. the enzyme of lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 was the most resistant, and about 25 mm fluoride was required for 50% inhibition. the response to fluoride appeared to involve reversible, noncompetitive inhibition during short exposure to low levels of fluoride and nonreversible inhibition at higher fluoride levels. in addition,  kinetic studies of the effects of fluoride on the enzymes of membranes of s. mutans and l. casei indicated that reversible inhibition was at least partly overcome at high levels of either atp or mg. the effects of ph on fluoride inhibition of atpases were markedly different from the effects of ph on inhibition of acid/base regulation of intact cells by fluoride. it appeared that  formation of hf was not required for inhibition of the atpases. f1 atpases isolated from the membranes by washing with buffers of low ionic strength proved  to be less sensitive to fluoride than the membrane-associated f1f0 holoenzymes, and it was concluded that the f0 or membrane sector of the holoenzyme is involved in fluoride inhibition.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
AB  == similar to streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when  treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. for lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at phs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate.  for f. nucleatum suspended at ph 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/l bicarbonate activation. when lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, ph  5.3, lysis was observed only with l. plantarum and s. mutans, but not with l. casei. the latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. in experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for l. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to  salivary factors other than lysozyme. f. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral ph, suggesting that both gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

AB  == human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b,  c, d, and e and strains of lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis. the desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.8) containing 0.154  m sodium chloride. after another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. the l. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. however, all strains, including the nonagglutinating l. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. the agglutinin extracts from s. mutans serotype c, s. sanguis, and a. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. the purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. all agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that  was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. this type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

TI  == immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  == rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified streptococcus mutans l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. the enzyme affinity for pyruvate or nadh decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate  (fdp) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. a partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with fdp prior to the antibody adjunction. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when fdp was added. the protective effect observed with fdp could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. a decrease of antibody binding in the presence of fdp was also obtained with s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. nadh did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. on the contrary,  pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. a decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of streptococcus mutans: purification of hpr and enzyme i and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == ph change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

TI  == lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) from streptococcus mutans omz175 was purified to homogeneity as judged  by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. the purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, deae-sephacel and blue-sepharose cl.6b chromatography, and sephacryl s200 gel permeation. the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between ph 5 and 6.2. the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was  around 0.02 mm and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. the enzyme seemed  to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mm enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. the enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to nadh, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a hill coefficient of about 1.9. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on sephacryl s200. monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. antibodies obtained against the purified s. mutans omz175 ldh cross-reacted with the sodium  dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of ldhs from different s. mutans serotypes, streptococcus sanguis omz9, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, and actinomyces viscosus ny 1. a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of l-ldhs from s. mutans serotypes and s. sanguis. cross-reactions were also observed with the ldhs from a. viscosus and l. casei, the latter being the least related. a very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the l-ldh from s. mutans omz175 and the d-ldh from lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be  detected with mammal ldhs.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

TI  == lactose transport in streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor iiilac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo studies of cellular lysis of oral bacteria by a lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system.
AB  == compared with anion-activated cell lysis of oral bacteria damaged with either lysozyme or trypsin, cells which were treated with both of these enzymes showed a far greater degree of lysis. this was true regardless of whether turbidimetric, dna release, or electron microscopic assays were used to monitor the lytic process. at an acidic ph of 5.2 and an nahco3 concentration of 100 mm, the kinetics of lysis for two different serotype c strains of streptococcus mutans were similar. at 0 to 100 mm bicarbonate, however, differences in the lytic susceptibilities of the two strains were evident. at ph 5.2, nahco3, but not nascn, nacl, or naf, was effective in promoting cell lysis of the oral bacteria.  at apparent sublytic concentrations of nahco3, lysis was achieved by adding appropriate concentrations of nascn, nacl, or naf to the lysozyme-protease-damaged cells. in in vivo studies, hamsters given a combination of nahco3, nacl, and nascn were found to have significantly reduced levels of s.  mutans on their molar teeth compared with that found in controls or animals exposed to any one of the salts alone or to a combination of chloride and thiocyanate only. the results suggest that bicarbonate is an essential anion which, together with the other major salivary inorganic monovalent anions, plays  an active role in the lysis and ultimate elimination of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == comparison of polyvinyl chloride membrane electrodes sensitive to alkylphosphonium ions for the determination of the electrical difference (delta psi) of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei.
AB  == polyvinyl chloride membrane electrodes sensitive to tetraphenyl phosphonium (tpp+), butyltriphenyl phosphonium ( btpp +), and methyltriphenyl phosphonium ( mtpp +) ions have been compared for the determination of the electrical potential difference (delta psi) of the oral bacteria, streptococcus mutans dr0001 /6 and lactobacillus casei rb1014 . all three types of electrode proved suitable for determining delta psi, although the tpp+-sensitive electrode was particularly susceptible to interference by protonmotive force (delta p) dissipators known to  inhibit sugar uptake by the bacteria. the mtpp +-sensitive electrode was the least affected. similarly, both strains had a high nonspecific binding capacity for tpp+ and btpp + ions, and this increased for all three ions when the bacteria were heated to 80 degrees c for 1 h to abolish glucose uptake and metabolism. this heat-treatment procedure is therefore not a suitable control for determination of nonspecific binding to cells. however, 1% (v/v) toluene, 20 microm gramicidin, or 10 microm valinomycin effectively depolarized the bacteria  without interfering with nonspecific binding. the ionophores were therefore used  subsequently for the determination of nonspecific binding of the lipid-soluble cations. the mtpp + ion and corresponding electrode proved the most effective system, and delta psi values of -89 and -107 mv were obtained for s. mutans and l. casei, respectively, harvested from glucose-limited continuous cultures and incubated in 100 mm hepes-koh buffer (ph 7.0), containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm glucose. although the delta psi of s. mutans decreased significantly in the presence of mes-koh and potassium phosphate buffers at ph 7.0, it increased to -119 mv in tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.0).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evidence for presence of a xylitol phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans omz 176.
AB  == a cariogenic bacterial strain, streptococcus mutans omz 176, was found to be able to take up xylitol by a phosphotransferase system (pts) in spite of lack of ability to catabolize this pentitol. a metabolite with an rf value in tlc similar to xylitol 5-phosphate was extracted from resting cells which had been exposed to 14c xylitol. phosphatase treatment of this metabolite yielded xylitol. it is suggested that the inhibition of growth of strep. mutans observed in several laboratories can be explained in terms of accumulation of xylitol phosphate (presumably xylitol 5-phosphate) inside the cells. it is furthermore suggested that xylitol is transported and phosphorylated through the fructose pts.

AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == oral ecology and virulence of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mutans in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == lactobacilli comprise a small percentage of the normal oral microbial flora of humans and are isolated commonly from saliva and frequently from an active caries lesion. we have compared the pathogenesis and colonization pattern of lactobacillus casei with that of streptococcus mutans strain 6715 in gnotobiotic  rats. of the two l. casei strains tested, l. casei strain atcc 4646 caused slightly more caries than l. casei strain atcc 11578. however, the level of caries induced by either l. casei strain was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that observed in similar-aged rats monoassociated with s. mutans strain 6715. when groups of rats were infected with mixtures of l. casei strain atcc 4646 and s. mutans strain 6715, or with l. casei followed by s. mutans, higher numbers of l. casei than s. mutans were found associated with the tongue and in saliva; s. mutans always predominated in plaque. the level of caries observed in these groups of rats was similar to that seen with rats monoassociated with s. mutans except when l. casei comprised greater than 1% of the plaque microflora. in this latter situation, the level of caries was significantly lower (p less than or equal to 0.05) than that obtained in s. mutans-monoassociated rats. the results of this study suggest that l. casei colonizes sites in the oral cavity (including the tongue and saliva) other than the tooth surface in rats. the effect of l. casei in plaque toward reduction of s. mutans-induced dental caries in rats is discussed.

TI  == interaction of streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases with teichoic acids.
AB  == the streptococcus mutans gs5 glucosyltransferase activities (both water-soluble and -insoluble glucan-synthesizing fractions) were inhibited by purified lipoteichoic acid. in vitro sucrose-dependent colonization of smooth surfaces by  strain gs5 was also markedly reduced in the presence of the amphipathic molecules. the inhibition of soluble glucan synthesis by lipoteichoic acid appeared to be competitive with respect to both sucrose and primer dextran t10. these inhibitory effects were dependent on the presence of the fatty acid components of lipoteichoic acid since deacylated lipoteichoic acids did not inhibit glucosyltransferase activity. however, the deacylated molecules did interact with the enzymes since deacylated lipoteichoic acid partially protected  the enzyme activity against heat inactivation and also induced the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme complexes from the soluble glucan-synthesizing fraction. the presence of teichoic acid in high-molecular-weight aggregates of glucosyltransferase isolated from the culture fluids of strain gs5 was suggested  by the detection of polyglycerophosphate in these fractions. in addition to strain gs5, two other organisms containing polyglycerophosphate teichoic acids, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum, were demonstrated to bind glucosyltransferase activity. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of teichoic acid-glucosyltransferase interactions in enzyme binding to the cell surface of s. mutans and the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme aggregates in the culture fluids of the organism.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

AB  == sterile enamel samples treated by topical application of 10% stannous fluoride were incubated with s mutans and s sanguis respectively and with a mixed culture  to which l casei had been added. the results were compared with sterile nonfluoridated enamel samples subjected to the same procedures. the parameters compared were postincubation ph values, bacterial concentrations on the surfaces, and enamel surface alterations. stannous fluoride treated samples consistently yielded higher ph readings than nonfluoridated samples; the concentration of microorganisms adhering to the surfaces was conspicuously reduced on the pretreated enamel when compared by scanning electron microscopy to untreated samples, as were enamel surface alterations. these findings lend support to other recent investigations which have shown that fluorides act in several ways to inhibit cariogenesis in addition to reducing hydroxyapatite solubility.

TI  == sucrose metabolism by prominent members of the flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaques.
AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == acid production from lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  == effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. the effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.

TI  == formation of extracellular lipoteichoic acid by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == examination of the culture fluids from a number of strains of oral streptococci and latobacilli has shown the presence of an erythrocyte-sensitizing antigen with the properties of lipoteichoic acid. the antigen was isolated from the culture fluids of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum and characterized chemically and serologically, for other strains, serological evidence for the presence of lipoteichoic acid depends on the reactivity with antiserum specific for the glycerol phosphate backbone. the relative concentrations of the antigen in culture fluids from different organisms, in culture fluids from different stages of growth, and in extracts of organisms was estimated by determining the maximum dilution that fully sensitized erythrocytes; the culture fluid titer, which is the reciprocal of the dilution, varied from 4 to 320. strains of streptococcus mutans were generally characterized by a high level of extracellular lipoteichoic acid, the amount being greater than that detectable in cell extracts; this conclusion was confirmed by using the quantitative precipitin method. a high-molecular-weight fraction obtained from s. mutans bht culture fluid was effective in sensitizing erythrocytes at a concentration of 1 mug/ml, compared with 2 mug/ml required for cellular lipoteichoic acid from l. casei. the detecting procedure depends on the teichoic acid sensitizing erythrocytes but, as shown with l. fermentum, low-molecular-weight nonsensitizing teichoic acid may also be present in culture fluid.
