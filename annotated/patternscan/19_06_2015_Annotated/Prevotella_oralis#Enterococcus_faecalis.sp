TI  == antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.
