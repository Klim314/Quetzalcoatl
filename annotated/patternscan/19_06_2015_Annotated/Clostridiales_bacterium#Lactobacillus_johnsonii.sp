TI  == a metagenomic approach to characterization of the vaginal microbiome signature in pregnancy.
AB  == while current major national research efforts (i.e., the nih human microbiome project) will enable comprehensive metagenomic characterization of the adult human microbiota, how and when these diverse microbial communities take up residence in the host and during reproductive life are unexplored at a population level. because microbial abundance and diversity might differ in pregnancy, we sought to generate comparative metagenomic signatures across gestational age strata. dna was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the v5v3 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes were sequenced (454flx titanium platform). sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units (otu); principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing >2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837  sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses.  although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix ph >4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific otus and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of lactobacillus species (l. iners crispatus, jensenii  and johnsonii, and the orders lactobacillales (and lactobacillaceae family), clostridiales, bacteroidales, and actinomycetales. this intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16s rrna gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.
