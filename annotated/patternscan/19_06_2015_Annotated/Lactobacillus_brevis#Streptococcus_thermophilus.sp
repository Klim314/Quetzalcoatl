TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  == in order to investigate the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, dna was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions with variable length were amplified. the standard universal reverse primer l1 aligning to bacterial 23s rdna was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. therefore, l1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers gplusr and gminusr aligning to the adjacent, more conserved dna region. the amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. from representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. sequencing revealed that the samples contained lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, streptococcus macedonicus, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, debaromyces hansenii, mucor fragilis, yarrowia lipolytica and galactomyces geotrichum. these results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese. the introduced automated ribosomal dna intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == microflora of feta cheese from four greek manufacturers.
AB  == the components of the microflora of four feta cheeses, produced by different greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by polymerase  chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and then representatives of each dgge group were sequenced for identification purposes. dna and rna, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to pcr-dgge. moreover, feta cheeses were subjected to fish analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. the microbial ecology, as represented by the lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. the main lab species isolated were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis and lactobacillus fermentum. however, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. in the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by pcr-dgge compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were kluyveromyces lactis, pichia fermentans and c. zeylanoides. fish analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus spp. rapd-pcr performed on the l. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.

TI  == a randomized, controlled trial of lactic acid bacteria for idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: urinary oxalate excretion is an important contributor to calcium oxalate stone formation. methods of reducing oxalate excretion are not wholly satisfactory, and no controlled trials using them have been performed to prevent  stone recurrence. some lactic acid bacteria can degrade oxalate in vitro. this study sought to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in calcium stone formers with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. design, setting, participants, and measurements: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed of oxadrop, a mix of four lactic acid bacterium species. this preparation previously reduced oxalate excretion in stone formers with idiopathic and enteric hyperoxaluria. patients were selected from two stone prevention clinics. twenty people with calcium stones and idiopathic hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/d) were enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 in placebo and active preparation arms. both groups took 3.6 g of granulate each day: either placebo or the experimental preparation. participants  performed two consecutive 24-h urine collections at baseline, at 28 d of therapy, and at 56 d, after being off the preparation for 4 wk. diet was replicated at each point. results: there was no effect of the study preparation: mean 24-h urinary oxalate excretion in placebo-treated patients was 73.9 mg at baseline and 72.7 mg after treatment, whereas the oxadrop-treated patients had 59.1 mg at baseline and 55.4 mg after treatment. the preparation was well tolerated; three participants on active treatment experienced mild constipation. conclusions: in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, oxadrop did not reduce urinary oxalate excretion in participants with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary  oxalate absorption. methods: ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by  jejunoileal bypass (1) and roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). for 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (oxadrop), vsl pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. results: mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, p < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, p < 0.05). during the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: manipulation of gastrointestinal (gi) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. these changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == apoptotic effects of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on a human t leukemia cell line are associated with bacterial arginine deiminase and/or sphingomyelinase activities.
AB  == the aim of the present work was, first, to analyze the apoptotic effect in vitro  of sonicated preparations of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on normal and tumor human lymphocytes. incubation with bacterial samples led to a relevant  time-dependent apoptotic cell death of jurkat cells but not normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. lactobacillus brevis (cd2) samples were more efficient in inducing apoptosis of jurkat cells than were samples of streptococcus thermophilus (s244). in an attempt to characterize the mechanisms underlying these effects, we found that the apoptotic death-inducing ability of s244 preparations could be attributed to the ability of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity to generate relevant amounts of ceramide, a known apoptotic death messenger, in jurkat cells. on the other hand, our results indicate that apoptosis induced by cd2 samples could also be associated with high levels of arginine deiminase activity, which in turn was able to downregulate polyamine synthesis in jurkat cells.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  == in an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (a)-->kefir made from kefir grains (b)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (c), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lactobacillus brevis. yeasts (10-17%) identified were kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida inconspicua and candida maris. in  the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. along the pathway a-->b-->c, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. k. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir c.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.
