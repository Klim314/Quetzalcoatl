TI  == age-dependent changes in porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species/phylotypes in healthy gingiva and inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites.
AB  == objectives: early colonisation of oral surfaces by periodontal pathogens presents a significant risk factor for subsequent development of destructive disease affecting tissues that support the dentition. the aims of the present study were  to establish the age-dependent relationship between sub-gingival profiles of 22 prevotella species/phylotypes in children, adolescents and adults from an isolated aboriginal community and, further, to use this information to identify prevotella species that could serve as microbial risk indicators. materials and methods: dna isolated from sub-gingival plaque samples (three healthy sites and three inflamed/diseased sites) from adults, adolescents and children was screened for porphyromonas gingivalis load and 22 prevotella species/phylotypes by species-specific pcr. results: a noticeable feature in adolescents was the marked increase in colonisation by p. gingivalis across all test sites. the mean number  of prevotella species/phylotypes colonising inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites  increased with age. progressive partitioning of selected prevotella species/phylotypes to healthy or inflamed/diseased sites was evident. prevalence  of prevotella intermedia, prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 and prevotella oris increased significantly with age in diseased sites. similarly, significant age-dependent increase in colonisation of healthy as well as inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites was apparent for prevotella oralis, prevotella multiformis, prevotella denticola, prevotella strain p4p_53 and prevotella oral clone br014. conclusion: early colonisation of children by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 provides indication of risk for subsequent development of periodontal disease. clinical relevance: in the present study, the complexity of prevotella species within gingival sites is explored as a basis for evaluating contribution of prevotella species to disease.

TI  == prevotella multiformis sp. nov., isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  == four bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, pppa19, pppa21(t), pppa28 and pppa30, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and the phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of  the isolates was a member of the genus prevotella. these strains were related to  prevotella denticola with about 95 % similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. however, the cells of these strains were often cocci (coccobacilli), depending on the cultivation time. colonies of different sizes were detected on eggerth gagnon agar plates for these strains. the cells forming large colonies were cocci, whereas those forming small colonies were cocci and rods. however, 16s rrna gene  sequence comparison of colonies of different sizes revealed that only a single organism was present. although these strains had phenotypic characteristics that  were similar to those of p. denticola jcm 8528, they could be differentiated from p. denticola jcm 8528 by aesculin hydrolysis and d-cellobiose fermentation in api 20a tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinction of  these four strains with respect to p. denticola jcm 8528. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multiformis sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa21(t) (=jcm 12541(t)=dsm 16608(t)) as the type strain.
