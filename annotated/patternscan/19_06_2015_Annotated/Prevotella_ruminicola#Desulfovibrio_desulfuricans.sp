TI  == anaerobic bioremediation of rdx by ovine whole rumen fluid and pure culture isolates.
AB  == the ability of ruminal microbes to degrade the explosive compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx) in ovine whole rumen fluid (wrf) and as 24 bacterial isolates was examined under anaerobic conditions. compound degradation was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification of metabolites. organisms in wrf microcosms degraded 180 mum rdx within 4 h. nitroso-intermediates hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (mnx), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (dnx), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (tnx) were present as early as 0.25 h and were detected throughout the 24-h incubation period, representing one reductive pathway of ring cleavage. following reduction to mnx, peaks consistent  with m/z 193 and 174 were also produced, which were unstable and resulted in rapid ring cleavage to a common metabolite consistent with an m/z of 149. these represent two additional reductive pathways for rdx degradation in ovine wrf, which have not been previously reported. the 24 ruminal isolates degraded rdx with varying efficiencies (0-96 %) over 120 h. of the most efficient degraders identified, clostridium polysaccharolyticum and desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans degraded rdx when medium was supplemented with both nitrogen and carbon, while anaerovibrio lipolyticus, prevotella ruminicola, and streptococcus bovis ifo utilized rdx as a sole source of nitrogen. this study showed that organisms in whole rumen fluid, as well as several ruminal isolates,  have the ability to degrade rdx in vitro and, for the first time, delineated the  metabolic pathway for its biodegradation.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.
