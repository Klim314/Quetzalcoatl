TI  == antimicrobial air filters using natural euscaphis japonica nanoparticles.
AB  == controlling bioaerosols has become more important with increasing participation in indoor activities. treatments using natural-product nanomaterials are a promising technique because of their relatively low toxicity compared to inorganic nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes. in this study, antimicrobial filters were fabricated from natural euscaphis japonica nanoparticles, which were produced by nebulizing e. japonica extract. the coated  filters were assessed in terms of pressure drop, antimicrobial activity, filtration efficiency, major chemical components, and cytotoxicity. pressure drop and antimicrobial activity increased as a function of nanoparticle deposition time (590, 855, and 1150 microg/cm2filter at 3-, 6-, and 9-min depositions, respectively). in filter tests, the antimicrobial efficacy was greater against staphylococcus epidermidis than micrococcus luteus; ~61, ~73, and ~82% of m. luteus cells were inactivated on filters that had been coated for 3, 6, and 9 min, respectively, while the corresponding values were ~78, ~88, and ~94% with s. epidermidis. although statistically significant differences in filtration performance were not observed between samples as a function of deposition time, the average filtration efficacy was slightly higher for s. epidermidis aerosols (~97%) than for m. luteus aerosols (~95%). high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (esi/ms) analyses confirmed that the major chemical compounds in the e. japonica extract were 1(ss)-o-galloyl pedunculagin, quercetin-3-o-glucuronide, and kaempferol-3-o-glucoside. in vitro cytotoxicity and disk diffusion tests showed that e. japonica nanoparticles were less toxic and exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity toward some bacterial strains than a reference soluble nickel compound, which is classified as a human carcinogen. this study provides valuable information for the development of a bioaerosol control system that is environmental friendly and suitable for use in indoor environments.

TI  == an antibacterial ortho-quinone diterpenoid and its derivatives from caryopteris mongolica.
AB  == to identify antibacterial components in traditional mongolian medicinal plant caryopteris mongolica, an ortho-quinone abietane caryopteron a (1) and three its  derivatives caryopteron b-d (2-4) were isolated from the roots of the plant together with three known abietanes demethylcryptojaponol (5), 6alpha-hydroxydemethyl cryptojaponol (6), and 14-deoxycoleon u (7). the chemical  structures of these abietane derivatives were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data. compounds 1-4 had c-13 methylcyclopropane substructures, and  2-4 had a hexanedioic anhydride ring c instead of ortho-quinone in 1. the stereochemistry of these compound was assumed from noe spectra and ecd cotton effects. compounds 1 and 5-7 showed antibacterial activities against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and micrococcus luteus, being 1 the more potent.

TI  == design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  == twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. all the compounds had mics between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. in order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of  staphylococcus aureus. compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive  s. aureus (mssa) at mics of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa) at mics of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and mdr-mrsa at mic of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. the majority of cells in biofilm populations of mssa and mrsa were eradicated at low level of 3, with mbics in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of laserpitium latifolium l. and l. ochridanum micevski (apiaceae).
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of laserpitium latifolium and l. ochridanum were investigated. the essential oils were isolated by steam distillation and characterized by gc-fid and gc/ms analyses. all essential oils were distinguished by high contents of monoterpenes, and alpha-pinene was the most abundant compound in the essential oils of l. latifolium underground parts and fruits (contents of 44.4 and 44.0%, resp.). the  fruit essential oil was also rich in sabinene (26.8%). regarding the l. ochridanum essential oils, the main constituents were limonene in the fruit oil (57.7%) and sabinene in the herb oil (25.9%). the antimicrobial activity of these essential oils as well as that of l. ochridanum underground parts, whose composition was reported previously, was tested by the broth-microdilution method against four gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria and two candida albicans strains. except the l. latifolium underground-parts essential oil, the other investigated oils showed a high antimicrobial potential against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, or candida albicans (minimal inhibitory concentrations of 13.0-73.0 mug/ml), comparable to or even higher than that of thymol, which was used as reference compound.

TI  == bacterial constituents of indoor air in a high throughput building in the tropics.
AB  == airborne bacteria are significant biotic constituents of bioaerosol. bacteria at  high concentrations in the air can compromise indoor air quality (iaq) and result in many diseases. in tropical environments like malaysia that extensively utilize air-conditioning systems, this is particularly significant due to continuous recirculation of indoor air and the potential implications for human health. currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of airborne bacteria on iaq in malaysia. this study was prompted by a need for reliable baseline data  on airborne bacteria in the indoor environment of tropical equatorial malaysia, that may be used as a reference for further investigations on the potential role  played by airborne bacteria as an agent of disease in this region. it was further necessitated due to the threat of bioterrorism with the potentiality of release of exotic pathogenic microorganisms into indoor or outdoor air. before scientists can detect the latter, a gauge of the common microorganisms in indoor (as well as outdoor) air needs to be ascertained, hence the expediency of this study. bacterial counts from the broad-based and targeted study were generally in the order of 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) per m(3) of air. the most prevalent airborne bacteria found in the broad-based study that encompassed all five levels of the building were gram-positive cocci (67.73%), followed by gram-positive rods (24.26%) and gram-negative rods (7.10%). gram-negative cocci were rarely detected (0.71%). amongst the genera identified, kytococcus sp., micrococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., leifsonia sp., bacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. predominated in indoor air. the most dominant bacterial species were kytococcus sedentarius, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus luteus. the opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen, stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also discovered at a high percentage in the cafeteria. the bacteria isolated in this study have been increasingly documented to cause opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised patients, sometimes with fatal outcomes. furthermore, some of them are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. hence, we propose that indoor reservoirs of these bacteria and their associated clinical and more subtle health effects, if any, be investigated further.

TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  == background: rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant  and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. results: petals of r. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (hela) and breast cancer (t47d) cell lines and for antiradical activity  (with dpph*). as a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (ic(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) dpph*) were demonstrated.  moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. staphylococcus. epidermidis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (candida. albicans, c. parapsilosis) was shown.  total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. five phenolic acids and six  flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. conclusion: this is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of r. rugosa petals.

TI  == skin-associated bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  == dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the nlpc/p60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. to this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16s rrna, tuf and rpob gene sequencing of nine gram-positive isolates identified them as bacillus cereus, b.  licheniformis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis and micrococcus  luteus, known human skin commensals. 16s rrna sequence homologies of four of the  nine isolates identified as b. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. all species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands  detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. in conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. the identification  of a novel cluster of b. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared d. pteronyssinus. it remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 k lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.

TI  == bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  == finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign dna. therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. here we evaluated the use of the escherichia coli-bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pht01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. this library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus luteus. a new antibacterial activity against b. cereus was found upon screening in b. subtilis. the new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase k, was not active when the corresponding dna fragment was expressed in e. coli. our  results validate the use of pht01 as a shuttle vector and b. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.

TI  == domestic electric drills in the service of orthopaedic surgery: a potential and preventable source of surgical site infections.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the contamination potential of the exhaust air from venting ports of running domestic electric drills which are commonly used in orthopaedic surgeries by means of both microbiological sampling and particle counting. methods: in an empty operating room, the exhaust air from five running  sterile domestic electric drills measured using a particle counter and microbiological sampling was made via aspirating isolator with colony formations  noted for a 2-week period. international organization for standardization (iso) 14644 criteria were implemented with respect to the sterility standards. results: all of the drills produced statistically significantly higher levels of particles than the ambient air (p<0.01). there was no statistically significant difference  in the number of collected particles among drills (p>0.05). no bacterial growth was detected in microbiological sampling via blood agar medium in the ambient air. conversely, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus capitis were isolated from the exhaust air of all running drills.  there was no correlation between the number of particles produced by drills and the microbiological sampling. conclusion: domestic electric drills are not safe and may be a direct source of surgical site infection, as the use or re-use of these drills during orthopaedic surgery increases the risk of infection with contaminated aerosols that are produced by these devices.

TI  == nurses' uniforms: how many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  == this pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. to achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in washington state at the beginning of their shift. worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. the results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. after 48 h, mrsa  positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. additional bacteria identified include: bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus roseus. the significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of different parts of seseli rigidum.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of the balkan endemic species seseli rigidum waldst. & kit. (apiaceae) was investigated. the monoterpene alpha-pinene was predominant in the volatile oil from aerial parts (57.4%) and fruit (23.3%). in the essential oil of the aerial parts limonene (6.7%), camphene (5.8%) and sabinene (5.5%) were also present in high amounts, and in the fruit oil, beta-phellandrene (17.4%) and sabinene (12.9%). on the contrary, the root essential oil was composed almost entirely of the polyacetylene falcarinol (88.8%). the antimicrobial activity of the root essential oil was significant against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis (mics 6.25-25.00 microg/ml). volatile constituents from the root strongly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus (mics 6.25-50.00 microg/ml). anti-staphylococcal activity can be attributed to the main volatile constituent ofs. rigidum root, falcarinol.

TI  == green tea extract: possible mechanism and antibacterial activity on skin pathogens.
AB  == camellia sinensis (tea) is known for its therapeutic properties (anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-tumour, anti-oxidative and anti-ageing). although, anti-microbial properties of green tea have been studied, its role against bacterial strains related to skin infections and mechanism of action is not well understood. we focussed on exploring anti-microbial activity and the basic mechanism of aqueous green tea leaf extract on selected bacterial strains.  staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, brevibacterium linens, pseudomonas fluorescens and bacillus subtilis were found to be sensitive to green tea extract via disc diffusion assay (zone of inhibition >/=7 mm). minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined via nitro blue tetrazolium (nbt) assay (0.156-0.313 mg/ml). moreover, the aqueous extract was found to be not toxic to the vero cell-line up to a concentration of 500 mug/ml. the effect of aqueous extract on adhesion of different bacteria to vero cells indicated that it inhibits the adhesion at its mic value.

TI  == infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  == background/aim: infected total knee arthroplasty (tka) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. the aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following tka. methods: this retrospective study of infected tkas was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the orthopedics & traumatology clinic of the military medical academy (mma) in belgrade. a total of 654 primary and revised tkas were performed in the  said period. we registered and surgically treated 28 infected tkas (primary tkas: mma--22, other institutions--6). the incidence of tka infection in the mma was 3.36%. the most common pathogens were: staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. other isolated pathogens were: enterococcus  faecalis, klebsiella pneum., klebsiella spp., streptoccocus viridans, seratia spp, micrococcus luteus and peptostreptococcus spp. in one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. we analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected tkas. results: in our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. conclusion: two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected tka, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. the antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most  cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.

TI  == skin decontamination by low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma jet and dielectric barrier discharge plasma.
AB  == background: over the past few years, plasma medicine has become an important field in medical science. cold plasma has proven anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antineoplastic effects. aim: to test the decontamination power of two cold plasma sources [low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma jet (appj) and dielectric barrier discharge plasma (dbd)] in vivo on human fingertips. methods:  after 3, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 s of spot treatment with the  appj and dbd, the log reduction factors (rfs) of physiological (pf) and artificially (af) contaminated flora (staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus  luteus) were calculated. the bacterial load was determined after counting. tolerance (paresthesia, pain and heat) was measured using a numerical rating scale. findings: both plasma devices led to a significant reduction in pf and af. the maximum log reduction factors for pf were 1.3 for the dbd at 210 s and 0.8 for the appj at 60 s. for af, the maximum log reduction factors were 1.7 for the  dbd at 90 s and 1.4 for the appj at 120 s. treatment with both devices was well tolerated. conclusion: both the appj and dbd were highly effective in eradicating pf and af from the fingertips of healthy volunteers. no plasma-resistant isolates were observed. cold plasma appears to have potential for skin disinfection. for hand hygiene purposes, plasma exposure times would need to be reduced significantly by technical means.

TI  == in vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: pyrostegia venusta (ker gawl) miers. (bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). aim of the study: to investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. materials and methods: methanolic extracts of pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in wistar rats. healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. in vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. results: the results indicated that pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the  organisms: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and candida tropicana. during early wound healing phase tnf-alpha and il-6 level were found to be up regulated by pyrostegia venusta treatment. conclusion: increased wound contraction and tensile strength,  augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by  pyrostegia venusta flower extract. induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by pyrostegia venusta extract. results suggest that pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.

AB  == the essential oils of stachys spruneri boiss. (sample a and sample b) were analyzed by gc and gc-ms. (+)-isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and  further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. the microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and gram- negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast candida albicans. both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.

AB  == 4-benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type iia topoisomerase (dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=90 mum) but not against dna gyrase. an increase  in activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=14 mum) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). however, (2) showed only  weak antibacterial activity. although the results of the bacterial type iia topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase iv. the difference in activity against type iia topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the atp binding pocket.

TI  == study of microbial contamination and dosing accuracy of oral dispensers.
AB  == background and objective: the optimal administration of liquid medications requires accurate dose delivery. this is particularly important in the treatment  of infants and children, as well as elderly people, who are more sensitive to dosage errors. previous studies revealed significant dosage inaccuracies with measuring spoons. oral syringes are therefore generally recommended instead. there is no data on the efficacy of standard cleaning techniques, and consequently on the degree of microbial contamination associated with the repeated use of oral syringes. this study aimed to investigate the level and types of microorganisms found in oral dispensers subjected to simulated in-use conditions. in addition, the dosing accuracy of the oral dispensers is compared with that of measuring spoons supplied and designed for use with specific medications. methods: exadoral 5 ml oral dispensers from b. braun melsungen ag (melsungen, germany) were subjected to simulated in-use conditions and microbial  assay. six different liquid medications representing different substance classes  were included. the test lasted 4-15 days with two to four doses withdrawn according to dosage recommendations. dosing accuracy was assessed using six representative amoxicillin suspensions available on the german market after withdrawing 1.25, 2.5 and 5 ml that correspond to (1/4), (1/2) and full measuring spoons. results and discussion: low counts of micrococcus luteus, micrococcus lylae, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus chromogenes as well as bacillus species and candida lusitaniae may contaminate the interior surface of the oral dispenser, but the microbial count was below the accepted limit of microbial counts permissible for drinking water over the whole test period. hence, oral dispensers may be considered safe, provided that cleaning procedures are followed exactly. moreover, oral dispensers, although not specifically designed for the tested medication, showed much higher dosing accuracy in comparison with the specifically designed measuring spoons. conclusion: the present study revealed that oral dispensers are accurate measuring devices for the safe administration of liquid medication. pharmacists and physicians should encourage their patients  to use oral dispensers routinely in practice.

TI  == rapid differentiation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci and meticillin susceptibility testing directly from growth-positive blood cultures by multiplex real-time pcr.
AB  == this study evaluated a multiplex real-time pcr method specific for the meca, fema-sa and fema-se genes for rapid identification of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and non-s. epidermidis coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and meticillin susceptibility testing directly in positive  blood cultures that grew gram-positive cocci in clusters. a total of 100 positive blood cultures produced: 39 s. aureus [12 meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  31% of all the s. aureus]; 30 s. epidermidis (56.6% of the cons), 8 staphylococcus capitis (15.1%), 3 staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.7%), 4 staphylococcus hominis (7.5%), 3 staphylococcus haemolyticus (5.7%), 2 staphylococcus warneri (3.8%), 1 staphylococcus cohnii (1.9%) and 2 unidentified  staphylococcus spp. (3.8%); and 1 micrococcus luteus in pure culture. two blood cultures had no growth on subculture and five blood cultures grew mixed cons. for the 95 blood cultures with pure growth or no growth on subculture, there was very good agreement between real-time pcr and the bd phoenix identification system for staphylococcal species categorization in s. aureus, s. epidermidis and non-s. epidermidis cons and meticillin-resistance determination (cohen's unweighted kappa coefficient kappa=0.882). all mrsa and meticillin-susceptible s. aureus were correctly identified by meca amplification. pcr amplification of meca was more sensitive for direct detection of meticillin-resistant cons in positive blood cultures than testing with the bd phoenix system. there were no major errors when identifying staphylococcal isolates and their meticillin susceptibility within 2.5 h. further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical  benefit of using such a rapid test on the consumption of glycopeptide antibiotics and the alteration of empiric therapy in the situation of positive blood cultures growing staphylococci, and the respective clinical outcomes.

TI  == pitfalls in efficacy testing--how important is the validation of neutralization of chlorhexidine digluconate?
AB  == background: effective neutralization of active agents is essential to obtain valid efficacy results, especially when non-volatile active agents like chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) are tested. the aim of this study was to determine an effective and non-toxic neutralizing mixture for a propan-1-ol solution containing 2% chg. methods: experiments were carried out according to astm e 1054-02. the neutralization capacity was tested separately with five challenge microorganisms in suspension, and with a rayon swab carrier. either 0.5 ml of the antiseptic solution (suspension test) or a saturated swab with the antiseptic solution (carrier test) was added to tryptic soy broth containing neutralizing agents. after the samples were mixed, aliquots were spread immediately and after 3 h of storage at 2 - 8 degrees c onto tryptic soy agar containing a neutralizing mixture. results: the neutralizer was, however, not consistently effective in the suspension test. immediate spread yielded a valid neutralization with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium jeikeium but not with micrococcus luteus (p < 0.001) and candida  albicans (p < 0.001). a 3-h storage period of the neutralized active agents in suspension resulted in significant carry-over activity of chg in addition against staphylococcus epidermidis (p < 0.001) and corynebacterium jeikeium (p = 0.044).  in the carrier test, the neutralizing mixture was found to be effective and non toxic to all challenge microorganisms when spread immediately. however, after 3 h storage of the neutralized active agents significant carry-over activity of chg against micrococcus luteus (p = 0.004; tukey hsd) was observed. conclusion: without effective neutralization in the sampling fluid, non-volatile active ingredients will continue to reduce the number of surviving microorganisms after  antiseptic treatment even if the sampling fluid is kept cold straight after testing. this can result in false-positive antiseptic efficacy data. attention should be paid during the neutralization validation process to the amount of antiseptic solution, the storage time and to the choice of appropriate and sensitive microorganisms.

TI  == search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected indian medicinal plants.
AB  == a series of 61 indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against bacillus cereus var mycoides, bacillus pumilus, bacillus  subtilis, bordetella bronchiseptica, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and saccharomyces cerevisiae. twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at  least one of the test organisms used in the screening. on the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of dorema ammoniacum, sphaeranthus indicus, dracaena cinnabari, mallotus philippinensis, jatropha gossypifolia, aristolochia indica, lantana camara, nardostachys jatamansi, randia dumetorum and cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. this probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.

TI  == multiarray sensors with pattern recognition for the detection, classification, and differentiation of bacteria at subspecies and strain levels.
AB  == this work describes the integration of a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor with pattern recognition techniques for the detection and classification of bacteria at subspecies and strain level. the system provides a  continuous, real-time monitoring of bacteria activity upon exposure to antibiotics. the system utilizes 96-well-type electrodes array (dox-dissolved oxygen sensor) with principal component analysis (pca) for rapid and routine classification of different classes of bacteria and related strains. a representative sample of a section of the bacteria kingdom has been analyzed and  classified using the proposed dox-pca system, including the following: corynebacterium glutamicum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus epidermidis, yersinia ruckeri, escherichia adecarboxylata, comamonas acidovorans, alcaligenes  odorans, bacillus globigii, and three strains of escherichia coli (k12, sm10, atcc 25922). the new classification scheme is based on the hypothesis that, under identical experimental conditions, various bacteria consume oxygen at different rates and are affected in different ways by selected antibiotics. thus, the response of the individual electrode in the array is indirectly altered, compared to that of cells growing on medium, by the addition of the antibiotic. by using three different antibiotics in separate wells, a unique fingerprint can be created for a specific bacterium. with the proposed dox-pca system, classification of bacteria was achieved at subspecies and strain level in real time. this study represents a basic research tool that may allow researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and classify bacteria type at subspecies and strain levels.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == surface microflora of four smear-ripened cheeses.
AB  == the microbial composition of smear-ripened cheeses is not very clear. a total of  194 bacterial isolates and 187 yeast isolates from the surfaces of four irish farmhouse smear-ripened cheeses were identified at the midpoint of ripening using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), repetitive sequence-based pcr, and 16s rrna gene sequencing for identifying and typing the bacteria and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mitochondrial dna restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtdna rflp) analysis for identifying and typing the yeast. the yeast microflora was very uniform, and debaryomyces hansenii was the dominant species in the four cheeses. yarrowia lipolytica was also isolated in low numbers from one cheese. the bacteria were highly diverse, and 14 different species, corynebacterium casei, corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter arilaitensis, arthrobacter sp., microbacterium gubbeenense, agrococcus sp. nov., brevibacterium linens, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus equorum, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus luteus, halomonas venusta, vibrio sp., and bacillus sp., were identified on the four cheeses. each cheese had a more or less unique microflora with four to nine species on its surface. however, two bacteria, c. casei and a. arilaitensis, were found on each cheese. diversity at the strain level was also observed, based on the different pfge patterns and mtdna rflp profiles of the dominant bacterial and yeast species. none of the ripening cultures deliberately inoculated onto the surface were reisolated from the cheeses. this study confirms the importance of the adventitious, resident microflora in the ripening of smear cheeses.

TI  == correlation between the activities of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and hydrophobicities represented as rp hplc retention times.
AB  == ptp7 is a 13-amino acid residue peptide designed from gaegurin 6, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from skin secretions of rana rugosa. in order to examine the effect of hydrophobicity on antimicrobial activity, a series of ptp7  derivatives were constructed and analyzed the activity against bacteria and artificial membrane. we found that the mean hydrophobicity by simple summation of hydrophobicity of each constituent amino acid did not necessarily describe the hydrophobic property of antimicrobial peptides. the mean hydrophobicity did not show close correlation with the observed hydrophobicity by measuring reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (rp hplc) retention time. the observed hydrophobicity represented as rp hplc retention time correlated well with the activity against artificial membrane and gram positive bacterial species, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus luteus, rather than mean hydrophobicity. however, antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, did not show correlation with rp hplc retention time. these data indicate that the rp hplc retention time should be exploited rather than the mean hydrophobicity in the analysis of the relationship between hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of 9-o-acyl- and 9-o-benzoyl-substituted berberrubines.
AB  == in the course of a structure-activity relationship study on berberrubine derivatives, a series of compounds bearing 9-o-acyl-(4-6) and 9-o-benzoyl- (7) substituents was synthesized with the expectation of increasing the antimicrobial activity. one of the berberrubine derivatives, 9-lauroylberberrubine chloride was the most active against gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis as well as the gram-negative bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison to berberine, the currently used antibiotic in clinic. this result suggested that the presence of lipophilic substituents of certain structures and  sizes might be crucial for the optimal antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of finnish plant extracts containing flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.
AB  == plant phenolics, especially dietary flavonoids, are currently of growing interest owing to their supposed functional properties in promoting human health. antimicrobial screening of 13 phenolic substances and 29 extracts prepared from finnish plant materials against selected microbes was conducted in this study. the tests were carried out using diffusion methods with four to nine microbial species (aspergillus niger, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, saccharomyces cerevisiae, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis). flavone, quercetin and naringenin were effective in inhibiting the growth of the organisms. the most active plant extracts were purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria l.) against candida albicans, meadowsweet (filipendula ulmaria (l.) maxim.), willow herb (epilobium angustifolium l.), cloudberry (rubus chamaemorus l.) and raspberry (rubus idaeus l.) against bacteria, and white birch (betula pubescens ehrh.), pine (pinus sylvestris l.) and potato (solanum tuberosum. l.) against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

AB  == in this paper we assessed the suitability of the charm hvs and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (mrl). the multiplate system is composed of bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at ph 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, bacillus cereus plate at ph 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, micrococcus luteus plate at ph 8.0 for detection of macrolides, bacillus subtilis bga plate at ph 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with b. subtilis bga at ph 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, escherichia coli plate at ph 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and staphylococcus epidermidis plate at ph 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. for each  test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established eu mrls of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. the charm hvs test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near  the eu mrls. the multiplate system gave valid results. based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening  method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.

TI  == performance evaluation of disinfectant formulations using poloxamer-hydrogel biofilm-constructs.
AB  == poloxamer f127 is a di-block co-polymer of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene.  aqueous solutions show thermo-reversible gelation, being liquid at temperatures < 15 degrees c and robust gels at temperatures > 15 degrees c. chilled poloxamer solutions (30% w/v) were inoculated with approximately 10(4-5) cfu ml-1 of stationary phase cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa, ps. fluorescens, pantoea agglomerans, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis or listeria innocua. drops (200 microliters) of the inoculated poloxamers were placed on stainless steel coupons held in petri dishes containing moistened cotton wool and incubated at 30 degrees c for 5 h. all strains grew well giving between 10(6-7) cfu ml-1 at 5-6 h. the cultured gels were readily applied to tests of biocide effectiveness as the stainless steel coupons could be removed and flooded with biocide solution for fixed exposure times. provided that the temperature of the biocide solutions was > 15 degrees c, the integrity of the gels could be maintained during exposure. after exposure, the gels and their supports were removed to separate tubes containing neutralizer solution (< 15 degrees c). the gels rapidly dispersed within 5 min to ensure a complete recovery of the sample population. biofilm-constructs and cell suspensions (10(7) cfu ml-1) were exposed to four commercial disinfectant formulations, based on hypochlorite, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and a tenside, at recommended use levels. cell suspensions, in the presence of bovine serum albumen (bsa; 0.03% w/v), were subject to a > 5-log kill within 5 min while the killing effected against the biofilm-constructs varied between 0.4 and 2-log reductions. the results indicate a high degree of reproducibility between replicate samples, with patterns of susceptibility varying both as a function of organism, biocide type and concentration. the experiments strongly support the view that poloxamer-constructs are suitable for application in trials and testing of disinfectant formulations.

TI  == two-component anti-staphylococcus aureus lantibiotic activity produced by staphylococcus aureus c55.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus c55 was shown to produce bacteriocin activity comprising three distinct peptide components, termed staphylococcins c55alpha, c55beta, and  c55gamma. the three peptides were purified to homogeneity by a simple four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed  by xad-2 and reversed-phase (c8 and c18) chromatography. the yield following c8 chromatography was about 86%, with a more-than-300-fold increase in specific activity. when combined in approximately equimolar amounts, staphylococcins c55alpha and c55beta acted synergistically to kill s. aureus or micrococcus luteus but not s. epidermidis strains. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of all three peptides were obtained and staphylococcins c55alpha and c55beta were shown  to be lanthionine-containing (lantibiotic) molecules with molecular weights of 3,339 and 2,993, respectively. the c55gamma peptide did not appear to be a lantibiotic, nor did it augment the inhibitory activities of staphylococcin c55alpha and/or c55beta. plasmids of 2. 5 and 32.0 kb are present in strain c55,  and following growth of this strain at elevated temperature (42 degreesc), a large proportion of the progeny failed to produce strong bacteriocin activity and also lost the 32.0-kb plasmid. protoplast transformation of these bacteria with purified 32-kb plasmid dna regenerates the ability to produce the strong bacteriocin activity.

AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == identification and isolation of a bactericidal domain in chicken egg white lysozyme.
AB  == chicken egg white lysozyme exhibits antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of clostripain-digested lysozyme yielded a pentadecapeptide with antimicrobial activity but without muramidase activity. the peptide was isolated and its sequence found to be i-v-s-d-g-n-g-m-n-a-w-v-a-w-r (amino acids 98-112 of chicken egg white lysozyme). a synthesized peptide of identical sequence had the same bactericidal activity as the natural peptide. replacement of trp 108 with tyrosine significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide. by replacement of trp 111 with tyrosine the antibacterial activity was lost. replacement of asn 106 with the positively charged arginine strongly increased the antibacterial capacity of i-v-s-d-g-n-g-m-n-a-w-v-a-w-r. the peptide i-v-s-d-g-n-g-m consisting of the eight amino acids of the n-terminal side had no bactericidal properties, whereas  the peptide n-a-w-v-a-w-r of the c-terminal side retained some bactericidal activity. replacement of asparagine 106 by arginine (r-a-w-v-a-w-r) increased the bactericidal activity considerably. the d enantiomer of r-a-w-v-a-w-r was as active as the l form against five of the tested bacteria, but substantially less  active against serratia marcescens, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lentus. for these bacterial species some stereospecific complementarity between receptor structures of the bacteria and the peptide can be assumed.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

AB  == teicoplanin was evaluated in 47 patients with severe infections, including 14 patients with bone infections, 11 patients with soft-tissue infections, 7 patients with endocarditis, 5 patients with pneumonia, 3 patients with septic thrombophlebitis, 3 patients with septicemia of unknown origin, and 4 patients with miscellaneous infections. overall, bacteremia was documented in 24 patients. the pathogens isolated were 35 strains of staphylococcus aureus (including 8 methicillin-resistant strains), 4 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 strains of streptococcus faecalis, 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 5 strains of other streptococci, and 1 micrococcus luteus strain. a total of 22 patients (46.8%) were clinically cured, 8 patients (17.0%) improved, 2 patients (4.3%) had relapses after initial improvement, and 15 patients (31.9%) failed to  respond. the results were better in nonbacteremic patients (19 of 23 patients [82.6%] were cured or improved) than in patients with bacteremia (12 of 24 patients [50%] were cured or improved). bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (53.2%), and superinfections were documented in 6 patients (12.8%). no major adverse effects were observed. we conclude that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent for therapy of nonbacteremic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == secondary structure and phylogeny of staphylococcus and micrococcus 5s rrnas.
AB  == nucleotide sequences of 5s rrnas from four bacteria, staphylococcus aureus smith  (diffuse), staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 14990, micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 and micrococcus luteus atcc 4698, were determined. the secondary structural models of s. aureus and s. epidermidis sequences showed characteristics of the gram-positive bacterial 5s rrna (116-n type [h. hori and s. osawa, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 76:381-385, 1979]). those of m. luteus atcc 9341 and m. luteus  atcc 4698 together with that of streptomyces griseus (a. simoncsits, nucleic acids res. 8:4111-4124, 1980) showed intermediary characteristics between the gram-positive and gram-negative (120-n type [h. hori and s. osawa, 1979]) 5s rrnas. this and previous studies revealed that there exist at least three major groups of eubacteria having distinct 5s rrna and belonging to different stems in  the 5s rrna phylogenic tree.

TI  == microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  == primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. after sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination  of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria escherichia coli k 12 and staphylococcus aureus sg 511. microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. the following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with candida albicans). 2. cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. only one semen sample was  contaminated with bacteria (staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and streptococcus  nonhaemolyticus). non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.

TI  == [effects of photochemical smog from a flow reactor on bacteria. i. determination  of the effects of photochemical smog on bacteria].
AB  == to measure the damage to bacteria from photochemical smog serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus and spores of bacillus cereus have been exposed to defined gas-mixtures. a smog-simulation-chamber has been used which allowed adjustment of reproducible and longterm constant smog formations due to the flow system. two methods have been applied to examine the bactericidal effects of the photo-chemical smog: adsorption of bacteria to membrane filters and spraying on silk threads. smog mixtures formed by olefines (propene 4200 ppb, isobutene 3000 ppb, trans-2-butene 1600 ppb) and nitrogene oxides (500-700 ppb) showed bactericidal effects at ozone levels of 500 ppb. the survival of exposed bacteria is influenced less by gasing with 500 ppb ozone than with the smog mixture.

TI  == [action of egg lysozyme on representatives of the family micrococcaceae. the action on staphylococci].
AB  == the results of the study on the effect of various concentrations of lysozyme on staphylococci of three species, i.e. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus are presented. the study was performed with the use of the turbidimetric method. it was found that all the staphylococci had a common tendency for changing the optic density (od) of the suspensions under the effect of lysozyme which was different from that in micrococcus luteus. however, the dynamics of decreasing the od in staph. saprophyticus was characterized by some properties which provided a supposition that the structures of the cell walls in staph. aureus and staph. epidermidis were close, while the cell walls in staph. saprophyticus had some unknown characteristics.

TI  == interactions of bacillus licheniformis atcc 10716 and normal flora of human skin.
AB  == to determine whether antibiotic production might be ecologically advantageous in  the survival of bacillus species on human skin, we applied spores of a bacitracin-producing strain of bacillus licheniformis (atcc 10716) to the forearms of 11 volunteers. three additional strains of b. licheniformis which did not synthesize antibiotics, including a mutant of atcc 10716, were used in subsequent control trials. samples of flora were taken from inoculated and control (opposite forearm) sites during the colonization period, generally 3 weeks. although population densities were unaltered, changes in the carriage, composition, and bacitracin sensitivity of resident flora were related with the presence of atcc 10716 only, which suggests that microbial interactions are important in bacillus colonization and in maintenance of normal flora. interactions were examined in vitro by comparing growth curves of representative  skin bacteria, including isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus luteus, and a large-colony diphtheroid, grown individually, in mixed culture with each other, and together in presence of each  test strain of b. licheniformis. we observed some diminution of growth of m. luteus and the diphtheroid in the first mixed culture, and the diphtheroid was completely retarded in common culture with atcc 10716. lesser antibiotic effects  were seen on the cocci, whose rank of sensitivity was similar to that in vivo. the growth of the diphtheroid was enhanced in mixed culture with those strains of bacilli which lack antibiotic activity.

TI  == ecological effects of a deodorant and a plain soap upon human skin bacteria.
AB  == the effects of a commercial trichlorocarbanilide-containing deodorant soap and a  commercial plain soap upon the cutaneous flora of individuals were compared. using a cross-over design, 21 volunteers (10 women and 11 men) washed their forearms at least once a day with one soap for 3 weeks and then switched soaps for another 4 weeks use. by analysis of variance no significant difference in total colony counts was noted among individuals in their use of the two soaps. with the exception of individual variation, neither sequence of use, sex, nor any combination was influential. however, in 20 of 21 subjects an alteration in the composition of skin flora was observed. the deodorant soap, which in six cases increased total flora, tended to reduce or eliminate diphtheroids in 12 to 17 carriers (71%). fewer kinds of bacteria were also noted. more staphylococcus epidermidis was seen with the plain soap, but washing with the deodorant soap seemed to favour acinetobacter calcoaceticus and micrococcus luteus. the impact of this alteration and the use of total counts to measure effectiveness of deodorant soaps were brought into question.

TI  == preliminary studies on the characterization and distribution of staphylococcus and micrococcus species on animal skin.
AB  == a total of 221 strains of staphylococci and 98 strains of micrococci isolated from the skins of eastern gray squirrels, southern flying squirrels, raccoons, opossums, squirrel monkeys, swine, sheep, horses, cattle, and dogs were characterized in a preliminary attempt to resolve their natural relationships and distribution in nature. staphylococci demonstrating the widest host range included staphylococcus xylosus and unnamed staphylococcus sp. 3. unnamed staphylococcus sp. 2 was isolated only from sheep, staphylococcus sp. 4 only from opossums, staphylococcus sp. 5 only from squirrel monkeys, and staphylococcus sp. 6 only from swine. the predominant species isolated from human skin, including s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. haemolyticus, and s. capitis, were either not isolated or only rarely isolated from animal skin. micrococcus varians was the predominant micrococcus species isolated from animal skin. m. luteus was only occasionally isolated. m. lylae, m. sedentarius, m. roseus, m. kristinae, and m.  nishinomiyaensis, species occasionally isolated from human skin, were not isolated from animal skin.

TI  == [bacterial flora of the conjunctival sac of the horse].
AB  == the aa. report the results of taxonomic research conducted on the conjunctival sac of 59 horses for identification of the present bacterial flora. in the controlled animals, it was observed, at the level of the considered niche, a community constituted of normal bacterial populations, but not autochtonous in the significance they attributed from dubos et al., relative to the characterization of the indigenous microbiota of the intestine. the isolated normal bacterial flora seems to be constituted of: micrococcus (subgroup 6 of baird-parker, m. luteus, micrococcus spp.) isolated in 49,15% of the samples; staphylococcus aureus and st. epidermidis (18,64%); moraxella osloensis, m. phenylpiruvica, m. equi and moraxella spp. (11,86%); bacillus cereus (11,86%); neisseria catarrhalis (8,47%); streptococcus equi and str. zooepidemicus (6,77%); corynebacterium spp. (6,77%) and acinetobacter lwoffi (5,08%). the aa. have found, besides, a particular group of bacteria of uncertain classification, attributed to the coryneforms and found in 30,50% of the examined horses. so-called transient bacteria taxa have been considered are streptomyces spp., isolated in the 10,16% of the controlled subjects, aerococcus viridans and bacillus spp. found in only one equine.
