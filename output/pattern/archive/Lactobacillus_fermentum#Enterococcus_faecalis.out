lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
purification and characterization of a surface-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 that inhibits adhesion of enterococcus faecalis 1131.
lactobacilli have been shown to be important in the maintenance of the healthy urogenital flora. one strain, lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, releases surface-active components which can inhibit adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria. using a quantitative method for determining inhibition of adhesion, a protein with high anti-adhesive properties against enterococcus faecalis 1131 was purified. the n-terminal sequence of the 29-kda protein was identical to that of a collagen-binding protein from lactobacillus reuteri ncib 11951, and exhibited close homology with a basic surface protein from l. fermentum br11. the results suggest that this anti-adhesive cell surface protein of lactobacillus could protect against uropathogens by preventing their adhesion. the federation of european microbiological societies.
