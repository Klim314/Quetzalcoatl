TI  == isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. from faeces of the blue-fronted amazon parrot in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, the blue-fronted amazon parrot (amazona aestiva) is a common pet. the  faecal microbiota of these birds include a wide variety of bacterial species, the majority of which belong to the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (lab) clade. the aim of this study was to investigate differences in the diversity and abundance of lab and bifidobacterium spp. in the cloacae between wild and captive birds and to select, identify and characterise lab for consideration as a parrot  probiotic. cloacal swabs were collected from 26 wild and 26 captive birds. bacterial dna was extracted, and the 16s rrna genes were amplified. the numbers of pcr-positive enterococcus, pediococcus, and lactobacillus species isolated from wild and captive birds were significantly different (p<0.05). enterococcus was the most frequently isolated genus, followed by pediococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus and bifidobacterium. enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most frequently isolated species from all birds. this study increases our understanding of the faecal microbiota, and may help to improve the nutrition and habitat management of captive and wild parrots. the bacterial population identified in the faecal microbiota of clinically healthy wild and captive parrots can serve as a database to analyse variations in the gut microbiota of pathogen-infected parrots and to develop probiotics specific to these genera.

TI  == a pcr-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  == we developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. one specific primer, lblma1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16s and 23s rrna genes in a number of lactobacillus strains. amplification with lblma1-rev and r16-1, a universal primer, generated a pcr product for 23 lactobacillus species. electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, carnobacterium pissicola,  pediococcus pentosaceus, bifidobacterium bifidum, weissella confusa, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus or listeria monocytogenes dna were used as template.

TI  == the effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, lb. casei 20094, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, streptococcus thermophilus ts2, pediococcus pentosaceus pe39 and bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. the rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by mg2+, while the effect of k+ and na+ differed from strain to strain.  the beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. the types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in  each case, but the rates of their production differed. all the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.
