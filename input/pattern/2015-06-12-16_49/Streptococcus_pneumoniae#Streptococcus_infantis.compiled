TI  - The novel species Streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  - Streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. S. tigurinus belongs to the Streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and Streptococcus infantis. The presence of S. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including in patients with periodontal disease. This review addresses the available scientific knowledge on S. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. While there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of S. tigurinus with oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of Streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  - Streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the Streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus infantis. The type strain AZ_3a(T) of S. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. Accurate identification of S. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16S rRNA gene analysis. During the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of S. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis, which was originally identified as Streptococcus pluranimalium by Vitek 2. Confirmation by 16S rRNA gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with S. tigurinus AZ_3a(T) (AORU01000002). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of S. tigurinus from the oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - Streptococcus tigurinus, a novel member of the Streptococcus mitis group, causes  invasive infections.
AB  - We recently described the novel species Streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the Streptococcus mitis group. The type strain AZ_3a(T) of S. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. According to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, S. tigurinus is most closely related to Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus infantis. Accurate identification of S. tigurinus is facilitated by 16S rRNA gene analysis. We retrospectively analyzed our 16S rRNA gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. We detected 17 16S rRNA gene sequences which were assigned to S. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 S. tigurinus strains described previously. S. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16S rRNA gene PCR, followed by sequencing. The 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). To evaluate the presence of Streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. After selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and subsequent molecular methods. S. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. These data indicate that S. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. In conclusion, S. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.
TI  - Impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. However, with the exception of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. METHODS: We cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with THP-1 monocyte-like cells. We performed 16S rDNA analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCR analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether THP-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. RESULTS: We recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with THP-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. On average, tissue homogenates incubated with THP-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (P = 0.02). We recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, and confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qPCR demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) P. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. Our results suggest revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Structure and dynamics of the pan-genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae and closely  related species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. The genomes of 44 diverse strains of S. pneumoniae were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the Mitis group. RESULTS: Despite evidence of extensive recombination, the S. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. With the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome size of S. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. Most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all S. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of S. pneumoniae. The open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(B) and mef(A)] in Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within CF airways has not yet been examined. We therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. METHODS: Erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (VGS) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and VGS [n = 84; i.e. Streptococcus salivarius (n = 30), Streptococcus mitis (n = 17), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), Streptococcus oralis (n = 10), Streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), Streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), Streptococcus infantis (n = 3), Streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), Streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and Streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult CF patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for at least the previous 7 months. RESULTS: Almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. The majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(B) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(A) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(E) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(B) and mef(E) genes simultaneously in 11/99 (11.1%). These results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in VGS in adult CF patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with azithromycin in CF patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal VGS, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Evolution of Streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the Mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16S rRNA-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. While other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, S. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. Population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that S. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus infantis. The remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as Streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. Virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding IgA1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among S. mitis lineages. Estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, and S. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. During their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in their respective hosts.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Competence without a competence pheromone in a natural isolate of Streptococcus infantis.
AB  - Many streptococcal species belonging to the mitis and anginosus phylogenetic groups are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation. Induction of the competent state in these bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing mechanism consisting of a secreted peptide pheromone encoded by comC and a two-component regulatory system encoded by comDE. Here we report that a natural isolate of a mitis group streptococcus (Atu-4) is competent for genetic transformation even though it has lost the gene encoding the competence pheromone. In contrast to other strains, induction of competence in Atu-4 is not regulated by cell density, since highly diluted cultures of this strain are still competent. Interestingly, competence in the Atu-4 strain is lost if the gene encoding the response regulator ComE is disrupted, demonstrating that this component of the quorum-sensing apparatus is still needed for competence development. These results indicate that mutations in ComD or ComE have resulted in a gain-of-function phenotype that allows competence without a competence pheromone. A highly similar strain lacking comC was isolated independently from another individual, suggesting that strains with this phenotype are able to survive in nature in competition with wild-type strains.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
