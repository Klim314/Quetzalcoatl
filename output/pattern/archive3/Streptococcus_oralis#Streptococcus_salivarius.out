protective mechanisms of respiratory tract streptococci against streptococcus pyogenes biofilm formation and epithelial cell infection.
streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]) encounter many streptococcal  species of the physiological microbial biome when entering the upper respiratory tract of humans, leading to the question how gas interact with these bacteria in order to establish themselves at this anatomic site and initiate infection. here we show that s. oralis and s. salivarius in direct contact assays inhibit growth of gas in a strain-specific manner and that s. salivarius, most likely via bacteriocin secretion, also exerts this effect in transwell experiments. utilizing scanning electron microscopy documentation, we identified the tested strains as potent biofilm producers except for gas m49. in mixed-species biofilms, s. salivarius dominated the gas strains, while s. oralis acted as initial colonizer, building the bottom layer in mixed biofilms and thereby allowing even gas m49 to form substantial biofilms on top. with the exception of s. oralis, artificial saliva reduced single-species biofilms and allowed gas to dominate in mixed biofilms, although the overall two-layer structure was unchanged. when covered by s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms, epithelial cells were protected from gas adherence, internalization, and cytotoxic effects. apparently, these species can have probiotic effects. the use of affymetrix array technology to assess hep-2 cell transcription levels revealed modest changes after exposure to s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms which could explain some of the protective effects against gas attack. in summary, our study revealed a protection effect of respiratory tract bacteria against an important airway pathogen and allowed a first in vitro insight into local environmental processes after gas enter the respiratory tract.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide paste.
aim: to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide (ch) paste. materials and methods: the sample was composed of two sealers (fill canal((r)) and sealer 26((r))), one ch cement (hydro c((r))), and a ch paste. the agar diffusion test was performed in petri dishes inoculated with the following microorganisms: streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, candida krusei, and candida tropicalis. the diameters of the zones of microbial growth inhibition were measured after 24 h. the tests were performed in triplicate. data were analyzed statistically by anova and tukey's test at 5% significance level. results: fill canal((r)) exhibited the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against the candida species and differed significantly from the other groups (p < 0.001). when inhibition was observed against s. mitis and s. oralis, the ch paste presented a larger mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than those of the other materials (p < 0.05). regarding the inhibition of s. mutans, a statistically significant difference was observed only between the ch paste and hydro c((r)) (p < 0.05); the paste produced the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against this microorganism. regarding the inhibition of s. salivarius, fill canal((r)) presented smaller mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than sealer 26((r)) and ch paste (p < 0.05). conclusion: all the materials presented zones of microbial growth inhibition against all the test bacteria. fill canal((r)) presented the largest mean zone of inhibition against the candida species. for the streptococcus cultures, none of the sealers presented inhibition superior to that of the ch paste.
potent anticariogenic activity of aceriphyllum rossii and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid.
aceriphyllum rossii engler (saxifragaceae) have been used as a nutritious food in korea. we found that the methanol extract of a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, potently inhibited the growth of the key cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, with mic of 2 to 4 microg/ml. they also showed antibacterial activity against other cariogenic bacteria such as s. oralis, s. sobrinus, and s. salivarius with the similar potency. in the time-kill study, aceriphyllic acid a reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by 90% in 1 min at 8 microg/ml, indicating that aceriphyllic acid a had the fast bacteriostatic activity. severe damages of the cell surface of s. mutans by aceriphyllic acid a were observed by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting with its fast antibacterial activity that its mechanism of action might be membrane disruption. these results suggest that the methanol extract of a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, could have the great potential as natural agents for preventing dental caries.
the oral microbiota of children undergoing liver transplantation.
this study investigated the oral microbiota of children undergoing liver transplantation. oral swabs were taken using a standardized procedure from 27 children before liver transplantation and at 3 and 100 days post-transplantation and from 27 healthy controls at baseline and 90 days. viridans streptococci, yeasts, staphylococci, enterococci and enterobacteriaceae were enumerated and identified using conventional techniques. the oral microbiota of the patients changed significantly immediately post-transplantation, but by the final examination, it had returned to baseline levels. the oral microbiota of the controls did not change significantly. the numbers and proportions of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii as percentages of the total streptococcal counts and of the total anaerobic counts decreased significantly 3 days post-transplantation (p < or = 0.006). there were no significant changes in the numbers and proportions of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis isolated pre- and post-transplantation. the isolation frequencies and numbers of yeasts were significantly higher in patients than controls. staphylococci were isolated in low numbers from all children. enterococci and enterobacteriaceae were isolated infrequently from patients.
initial ph as a determining factor of glucose consumption and lactic and acetic acid production in oral streptococci.
lactic and acetic acid production was evaluated from six strains of oral streptococci, viz streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus sobrinus cultured in the presence of 1, 5, 10 mm glucose and without glucose, at initial ph values of 5, 5.5, 6 and 7. s. sobrinus and s. salivarius caused the greatest decreases in ph. at ph values of 5 and 5.5, lactic acid and acetic acid production in the species tested was discordant with residual glucose levels. acid production from protein was especially great in s. mutans and s. salivarius.
