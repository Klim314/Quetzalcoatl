TI  == distinctive proteolytic activity of cell envelope proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus isolated from airag, a traditional mongolian fermented mare's milk.
AB  == airag is a traditional fermented milk of mongolia that is usually made from raw mare's milk. lactobacillus helveticus is one of the lactic acid bacteria most frequently isolated from airag. in this study, we investigated the genetic and physiological characteristics of l. helveticus strains isolated from airag and clarified their significance in airag by comparing them with strains from different sources. six strains of l. helveticus were isolated from five home-made airag samples collected from different regions of mongolia. the optimal temperature for acidification in skim milk was 30 to 35 degrees c for all the mongolian strains, which is lower than those for the reference strains (jcm 1554  and jcm 1120(t)) isolated from european cheeses. all of the strains had a prth1-like gene encoding a variant type of cell envelope proteinase (cep). the cep amino acid sequence in snow brand typeculture (sbt) 11087 isolated from airag shared 71% identity with prth of l. helveticus cnrz32 (aad50643.1) but 98% identity with prth of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens zw3 (aeg40278.1) isolated from a traditional fermented milk in tibet. the proteolytic activities of the cep from sbt11087 on artificial substrate (n-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide) and pure casein were measured using an intact-cell degradation assay. the activity of the cep from sbt11087 was observed to be weak and exhibited a lower optimal temperature (40 degrees c) than those from the reference strains (45-50 degrees c). the specificity of the sbt11087 cep for alphas1-casein was typical of the ceps previously reported in l. helveticus, as determined through the degradation profiles obtained through gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analyses. in contrast, the degradation profile of beta-casein revealed that the cep of sbt11087 primarily hydrolyzes its c-terminal domain and hydrolyzed nine of the 16 cleavage sites shared among the ceps of other l. helveticus strains. thus, the cep of sbt11087 is distinct from those from previously reported l. helveticus strains in terms of its optimal temperature and its degradation of beta-casein. therefore, the mongolian l. helveticus strains differ from other strains of the species in different collections and are specifically suited for the natural lactic acid bacterial population in airag.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial diversity of airag, khoormog and tarag,  traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia.
AB  == here, we used pyrosequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of the microbial diversities of traditional fermented dairy products of mongolia. from 22 airag (fermented mare's milk), 5 khoormog (fermented camel's milk) and 26 tarag (fermented milk of cows, goats and yaks) samples collected in the mongolian provinces of arhangai, bulgan, dundgobi, tov, uburhangai and umnugobi, we obtained a total of 81 operational taxonomic units, which were assigned to 15 families, 21 genera and 41 species in 3 phyla. the genus lactobacillus is a core  bacterial component of mongolian fermented milks, and lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and lactobacillus delbrueckii were the predominant  species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the airag, khoormog and tarag samples, respectively. by using this pyrosequencing approach, we successfully detected most lab species that have been isolated as well as seven lab species that have not been found in our previous culture-based study. a subsequent analysis of the  principal components of the samples revealed that l. delbrueckii, l. helveticus,  l. kefiranofaciens and streptococcus thermophilus were the main factors influencing the microbial diversity of these mongolian traditional fermented dairy products and that this diversity correlated with the animal species from which the milk was sourced.

TI  == metagenomic analysis of the microbial community in kefir grains.
AB  == kefir grains as a probiotic have been subject to microbial community identification using culture-dependent and independent methods that target specific strains in the community, or that are based on limited 16s rrna analysis. we performed whole genome shotgun pyrosequencing using two turkish kefir grains. sequencing generated 3,682,455 high quality reads for a total of approximately 1.6 gbp of data assembled into 6151 contigs with a total length of  approximately 24 mbp. species identification mapped 88.16% and 93.81% of the reads rendering 4 mpb of assembly that did not show any homology to known bacterial sequences. identified communities in the two grains showed high concordance where lactobacillus was the most abundant genus with a mapped abundance of 99.42% and 99.79%. this genus was dominantly represented by three species lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus buchneri and lactobacillus helveticus with a total mapped abundance of 97.63% and 98.74%. we compared and verified our findings with 16s pyrosequencing and model based 16s data analysis.  our results suggest that microbial community profiling using whole genome shotgun data is feasible, can identify novel species data, and has the potential to generate a more accurate and detailed assessment of the underlying bacterial community, especially for low abundance species.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == analysis of the microflora in tibetan kefir grains using denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis.
AB  == the microflora of tibetan kefir grains was investigated by culture- independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partially amplified 16s rrna for bacteria and 26s rrna for yeasts, followed by sequencing of the most intense bands, showed that the dominant microorganisms were pseudomonas sp., leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus casei, kazachstania unispora, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and kazachstania exigua. the bacterial communities between three kinds of tibetan kefir grains showed 78-84% similarity, and yeasts 80-92%. the microflora is held  together in the matrix of fibrillar material composed largely of a water-insoluble polysaccharide.

TI  == lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.
