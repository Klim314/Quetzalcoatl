TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  - Florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in pigs caused by strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. Further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to be marginal for diseases caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/mL. An experiment was conducted during September and October 2009. One hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (Landrace-Yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. They were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. Two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). Water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by HPLC. Considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. However, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with MIC breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/mL. Decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with MIC >0.25 mug/mL, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of Streptococcus suis or E. coli to this drug.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Hong Kong: 10-years' experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the etiology, clinical features and outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis from an urban Chinese city over a 10-years period. METHODS: We reviewed the files of all persons aged 15-years old or above diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from a regional hospital. The clinical findings, relevant laboratory and imaging results as well as outcome were recorded in cases with microbiological evidence of meningitis. Neurosurgical and pediatric patients were excluded. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients between the ages of 15 and 86 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified of whom 18 (28%) died. The four most common causes were Mycobacteria tuberculosis (46%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Streptococcus suis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%). Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae were rare pathogens. The annual incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis was 1.27/100,000 adults. Delay in treatment was associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001, OR=38.84, CI=7.33-205.80). CONCLUSION: The causative organisms found in this region of China differ from that reported from Europe and the US; tuberculous meningitis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Adult community acquired bacterial meningitis in a Singaporean teaching hospital. A seven-year overview (1993-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to describe the bacteriological, clinical and laboratory features of community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults admitted to a Singapore tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis admitted between 1993 and 2000 were identified by their discharge diagnosis codes. All case records except for 57 which could not be retrieved were retrospectively reviewed. Patients less than 14 years or with skull fractures, post-neurosurgery or with indwelling intracranial devices were excluded. Inclusion criteria was a clinical picture compatible with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with either (1) positive cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) cultures or latex coagglutination or CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis accompanied by positive blood cultures or (2) in the absence of positive blood cultures, CSF cultures and latex agglutination, presence of CSF pleocytosis of at least 100 neutrophils per microL. RESULTS: Fifteen "culture-positive" and 11 "culture negative" cases were identified. Six (55%) of the "culture-negative" cases received antibiotics prior to admission. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four cases, three cases each of Group B streptococci and Neisseria meningitides. Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were each seen twice and Streptococcus suis once. All cases of Group B streptococci occurred in the year 1998. Mortality was 19% (n = 5), six developed infections in other sites, three epileptic seizures, three developed hydrocephalus, and two hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens are similar to those reported in other studies but for an outbreak of Group B Streptococcus in 1998. There were a high number of "culture-negative" cases which may be due to preceding antibiotic intervention.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
