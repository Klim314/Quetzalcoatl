TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == catabolism of l-ascorbate by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == catabolism of l-ascorbate by enteric bacteria is well documented, but no study has formally proved that bacteria of the lactobacillus genus ferment this compound. however, some genes analogous to those of yiak-s operon and ula regulon, which encoded proteins leading to l-ascorbate degradation by escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae , have been identified in the recently sequenced lactobacillus rhamnosus gg genome. investigations by hplc and in vivo (13)c nmr using l-[1,6-(13)c]-ascorbate showed that l. rhamnosus gg, a common probiotic strain, has the ability to catabolize l-ascorbate under anaerobiosis. the main products of the ascorbate degradation have been identified as co(2), acetate, and lactate. these results are in accordance with the metabolic pathway proposed for  the fermentation of l-ascorbate by e. coli.

TI  == preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus bulgaricus and lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. four types of beads, containing entrapped (e), surface and entrapped (es), surface (s) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (c(es)) were prepared and physically characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization,  freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecalis, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and ctx-m-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. alginate beads in which lactobacilli  proliferated to the beads surface (es and c(es)) differed significantly from the  other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (es) resulted  in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.

TI  == [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  == for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a  complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.

TI  == dichotomy between lactobacillus rhamnosus and klebsiella pneumoniae on dendritic  cell phenotype and function.
AB  == the reaction of the intestinal immune system to intestinal bacteria shows striking differences between various bacterial strains. whereas klebsiella pneumoniae induces a fierce proinflammatory reaction, the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus has clear anti-inflammatory effect in gastrointestinal disease and allergy. the molecular basis for this dichotomy is poorly understood  but is likely to involve different modulation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (dc) by l. rhamnosus and k. pneumoniae. hence we evaluated phenotypic and functional characteristics of dc matured in the presence of l. rhamnosus and k. pneumoniae. monocyte-derived immature dc were cultured in the presence of live bacteria to obtain mature dc. both micro-organisms induced maturation of immature dc as shown by cd83 and cd86 expression, but receptors involved in activation of  th1 cells were expressed predominantly on dc exposed to k. pneumoniae. in contrast to k. pneumoniae, maturation with l. rhamnosus resulted in lower tnf-alpha, il-6, and il-8 production by immature dc and lower il-12 and il-18 production by mature dc. moreover, l. rhamnosus led to the development of t cells without a typical th phenotype whereas k. pneumoniae induced a th1 immune response, dependent mainly on il-12 production. thus our results strongly support the concept that differential modulation of dc explains the differences in the immune response to various bacterial strains and indicates that k. pneumoniae induces th1 immune responses via dc.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infection with lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus leichmannii. the literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus), but  the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. we describe a case of w.  confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. this procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. he subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition. he later developed an enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia. at the present admission, he had fever (t(max), 39.5 degrees c) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. blood cultures grew k. pneumoniae and w. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. a culture of the patient's hickman catheter tip was negative. the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. his condition improved, and he was discharged home, where he completed 4 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. lactobacillemia seldom results in mortality; however, it may be a marker of a serious underlying disease. it is usually seen in patients who have a complex medical history or in patients who receive multiple antibiotics. lactobacillus spp. are generally associated with polymicrobial infections, and when isolated from the blood, they need to be considered possible pathogens. the presence of a vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccobacilli on a blood culture should alert clinicians to the possibility of bacteremia caused by w. confusa or other small gram-positive rods.
