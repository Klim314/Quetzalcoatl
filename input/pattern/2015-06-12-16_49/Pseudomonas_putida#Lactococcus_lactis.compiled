TI  - Perturbation of the monomer-monomer interfaces of the benzoylformate decarboxylase tetramer.
AB  - The X-ray structure of benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 shows it to be a tetramer. This was believed to be typical of all thiamin diphosphate-dependent decarboxylases until recently when the structure of KdcA, a branched-chain 2-keto acid decarboxylase from Lactococcus lactis, showed it to be a homodimer. This lent credence to earlier unfolding experiments on pyruvate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that indicated that it might be active as a dimer. To investigate this possibility in BFDC, we sought to shift the equilibrium toward dimer formation. Point mutations were made in the noncatalytic monomer-monomer interfaces, but these had a minimal effect on both tetramer formation and catalytic activity. Subsequently, the R141E/Y288A/A306F variant was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation to be partially dimeric. It was also found to be catalytically inactive. Further experiments revealed that just two mutations, R141E and A306F, were sufficient to markedly alter the dimer-tetramer equilibrium and to provide an ~450-fold decrease in kcat. Equilibrium denaturation studies suggested that the residual activity was possibly due to the presence of residual tetramer. The structures of the R141E and A306F variants, determined to <1.5 A resolution, hinted that disruption of the monomer interfaces will be accompanied by movement of a loop containing Leu109 and Leu110. As these residues contribute to the hydrophobicity of the active site and the correct positioning of the substrate, it seems that tetramer formation may well be critical to the catalytic activity of BFDC.
TI  - Microbial background flora in small-scale cheese production facilities does not inhibit growth and surface attachment of Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - The background microbiota of 5 Norwegian small-scale cheese production sites was  examined and the effect of the isolated strains on the growth and survival of Listeria monocytogenes was investigated. Samples were taken from the air, food contact surfaces (storage surfaces, cheese molds, and brine) and noncontact surfaces (floor, drains, and doors) and all isolates were identified by sequencing and morphology (mold). A total of 1,314 isolates were identified and found to belong to 55 bacterial genera, 1 species of yeast, and 6 species of mold. Lactococcus spp. (all of which were Lactococcus lactis), Staphylococcus spp., Microbacterium spp., and Psychrobacter sp. were isolated from all 5 sites and Rhodococcus spp. and Chryseobacterium spp. from 4 sites. Thirty-two genera were only found in 1 out of 5 facilities each. Great variations were observed in the microbial background flora both between the 5 producers, and also within the various production sites. The greatest diversity of bacteria was found in drains and on rubber seals of doors. The flora on cheese storage shelves and in salt brines was less varied. A total of 62 bacterial isolates and 1 yeast isolate were tested for antilisterial activity in an overlay assay and a spot-on-lawn assay, but none showed significant inhibitory effects. Listeria monocytogenes was also co-cultured on ceramic tiles with bacteria dominating in the cheese production plants: Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas putida, Staphylococcus equorum, Rhodococcus spp., or Psychrobacter spp. None of the tested isolates altered the survival of L. monocytogenes on ceramic tiles. The conclusion of the study was that no common background flora exists in cheese production environments. None of the tested isolates inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes. Hence, this study does not support the hypothesis that the natural background flora in cheese production environments inhibits the growth or survival of L. monocytogenes.
TI  - PCR-DGGE analysis of bacterial community dynamics in kava beverages during refrigeration.
AB  - AIMS: Kava beverages are highly perishable even under refrigerated conditions. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial community dynamics in kava beverages during refrigeration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four freshly made kava beverages were obtained from kava bars and stored at 4 degrees C. On days 0, 3 and 6, the aerobic plate count (APC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count and yeast and mould count (YMC) of the samples were determined. Meanwhile, bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Moreover, species-specific PCR assays were employed to identify predominant Pseudomonas spp. involved in kava spoilage. Over the storage period, the APC, LAB count and YMC of the four kava beverages all increased, whereas their pH values decreased. The DGGE profile revealed diverse bacterial populations in the samples. LAB, such as Weissella soli, Lactobacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis, were found in the kava beverages. Species-specific PCR assays detected Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens in the samples; Ps. fluorescens became dominant during refrigeration. CONCLUSIONS: LAB and Pseudomonas may play a significant role in the spoilage of kava beverages. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides important information that may be used to extend the shelf life of kava beverages.
TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. In this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. One hundred and two unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylations from 84 S. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of TiO(2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS determination. The identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. A striking characteristic of S. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies conjugal transfer of Tn916-like elements from Lactococcus lactis in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Lactococcus lactis strains originally isolated from Polish raw milk were analyzed for the ability to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes in vitro, using filter mating experiments, and in vivo, using germfree rats. Four of six analyzed L. lactis isolates were able to transfer tetracycline resistance determinants in vitro to L. lactis Bu2-60, at frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient. Three of these four strains could also transfer resistance in vitro to Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, whereas no transfer to Bacillus subtilis YBE01, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Agrobacterium tumefaciens UBAPF2, or Escherichia coli JE2571 was observed. Rats were initially inoculated with the recipient E. faecalis strain JH2-2, and after a week, the L. lactis IBB477 and IBB487 donor strains were introduced. The first transconjugants were detected in fecal samples 3 days after introduction of the donors. A subtherapeutic concentration of tetracycline did not have any significant effect on the number of transconjugants, but transconjugants were observed earlier in animals dosed with this antibiotic. Molecular analysis of in vivo transconjugants containing the tet(M) gene showed that this gene was identical to tet(M) localized on the conjugative transposon Tn916. Primer-specific PCR confirmed that the Tn916 transposon was complete in all analyzed transconjugants and donors. This is the first study showing in vivo transfer of a Tn916-like antibiotic resistance transposon from L. lactis to E. faecalis. These data suggest that in certain cases food lactococci might be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Detection and identification of bacteria in an isolated system with near-infrared spectroscopy and multivariate analysis.
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) transflectance spectra of Listeria innocua FH, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas mendocina, and Pseudomonas putida suspensions were collected and investigated for their potential use in the identification and classification of bacteria. Unmodified spectral data were transformed (first and second derivative) using the Savitzsky-Golay algorithm. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS2-DA), and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) were used in the analysis. Using either full cross-validation or separate calibration and prediction data sets, PLS2 regression classified the five bacterial suspensions with 100% accuracy at species level. At Pseudomonas genus level, PLS2 regression classified the three Pseudomonas species with 100% accuracy. In the case of SIMCA, prediction of an unknown sample set produced correct classification rates of 100% except for L. innocua FH (77%). At genus level, SIMCA produced correct classification rates of 96.7, 100, and 100% for P. fluorescens, P. mendocina, and P. putida, respectively. This successful investigation suggests that NIR spectroscopy can become a useful, rapid, and noninvasive tool for bacterial identification.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the Citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria innocua, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis) and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the Gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). The interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. CONCLUSION: The enzyme preparation Pectinase 62L efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of Citrus flavonoids. Pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  - The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. In addition to species commonly encountered in milk, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus equorum, Micrococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter sp., Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, Clostridium sp. and Rothia sp. Several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Salinicoccus sp., Dietza maris, Exiguobacterium, Ornithinicoccus sp. and Hahella chejuensis. The yeast community was composed of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta, Candida pararugosa, Candida intermedia, Candida inconspicua, Cryptococcus curvatus and Cryptococcus magnus. The analyses of microbial counts and microbial SSCP profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding regime. The microbial community was stable within each period. Milks from winter were characterized by Lactococcus and Pseudomonas, those from summer by P. agglomerans and Klebsiella and those from autumn by Chryseobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and yeasts. However, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. This study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
