TI  == effect of phytogenic feed additives in soybean meal on in vitro swine fermentation for odor reduction and bacterial community comparison.
AB  == the effect of different phytogenic feed additives on reducing odorous compounds in swine was investigated using in vitro fermentation and analyzed their microbial communities. soybean meal (1%) added with 0.1% different phytogenic feed additives (fa) were in vitro fermented using swine fecal slurries and anaerobically incubated for 12 and 24 h. the phytogenic fas used were red ginseng barn powder (panax ginseng c. a. meyer, fa1), persimmon leaf powder (diospyros virginiana l., fa2), ginkgo leaf powder (ginkgo biloba l., fa3), and oregano lippia seed oil extract (lippia graveolens kunth, ol, fa4). total gas production, ph, ammonia-nitrogen (nh3-n), hydrogen sulfide (h2s), nitrite-nitrogen (no2 (-)-n), nitrate-nitrogen (no3 (-)-n), sulfate (so4 (--)), volatile fatty acids (vfa) and other metabolites concentration were determined. microbial communities  were also analyzed using 16s rrna dgge. results showed that the ph values on all  treatments increased as incubation time became longer except for fa4 where it decreased. moreover, fa4 incubated for 12 and 24 h was not detected in nh3-n and  h2s. addition of fas decreased (p<0.05) propionate production but increased (p<0.05) the total vfa production. ten 16s rrna dgge bands were identified which  ranged from 96 to 100% identity which were mostly isolated from the intestine. similarity index showed three clearly different clusters: i (fa2 and fa3), ii (con and fa1), and iii (fa4). dominant bands which were identified closest to eubacterium limosum (atcc 8486t), uncultured bacterium clone pf6641 and streptococcus lutetiensis (cip 106849t) were present only in the fa4 treatment group and were not found in other groups. fa4 had a different bacterial diversity compared to control and other treatments and thus explains having lowest odorous  compounds. addition of fa4 to an enriched protein feed source for growing swine may effectively reduce odorous compounds which are typically associated with swine production.

TI  == effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, ph, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. although several isolates of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterococcus, and the bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of escherichia coli, collinsela aerofaciense, eubacterium limosum, and clostridium perfringens could not. when fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. after the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of lactobacillus and streptococcus including enterococcus tended to increase. however, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including c. perfringens, decreased (p  < 0.05), and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas tended to decrease. moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. the fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p  < 0.05) on apple intake. these findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.

TI  == allobaculum stercoricanis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from canine feces.
AB  == morphological, biochemical, and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown anaerobic, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from dog feces. the unknown bacterium was tentatively identified as a eubacterium species, based on cellular morphological and biochemical tests. 16s rrna gene sequencing studies, however, revealed that it was phylogenetically distant from eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium. phylogenetically, the unknown species forms a hitherto unknown sub-line proximal  to the base of a cluster of organisms (designated rrna cluster xvi), which includes clostridium innocuum, streptococcus pleomorphus, and some eubacterium species. based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that  the unknown bacterium be classified as a new genus and species, allobaculum stercoricanis. using a specific rrna-targeted probe designed to identify allobaculum stercoricanis, in situ hybridisation showed this novel species represents a significant organism in canine feces comprising between 0.1% and 3.7% of total cells stained with dapi (21 dog fecal samples). the type strain of  allobaculum stercoricanis is dsm 13633(t)=ccug 45212(t).

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == characterisation of eubacterium cell wall: peptidoglycan structure determines arthritogenicity.
AB  == objective: to elucidate factors involved in the arthritogenicity of bacterial cell walls. methods: for characterisation of an arthritogenic eubacterium aerofaciens cell wall, peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (pg-ps) polymers were isolated by removing cell wall associated proteins (cwps), pg and ps moieties were separated, and an attempt was made to de-o-acetylate pg-ps. the cell wall of e limosum was used as a non-arthritogenic control. the chemical composition of these cell wall preparations was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. also, their ability to resist lysozyme degradation and to sustain experimental chronic arthritis was tested. results: the observations made with the cell wall of e aerofaciens, an anaerobic habitant of the human intestine, were compared with those reported from a pathogenic streptococcus, showing that in both strains a complex consisting of pg-ps is required for the induction of chronic arthritis. the ps moiety most probably protects pg from enzyme degradation, allowing prolonged tissue persistence and leading to the chronic synovial inflammation. cwps attached to pg-ps are not necessary for this function. o-acetylation of pg, which is required for arthritogenicity of the streptococcal cell wall, seems not to be present in the arthritogenic e aerofaciens pg or only occurs to a small degree; attempts to de-o-acylate the e aerofaciens cell wall did not affect its arthritogenicity or lysozyme resistance. conclusion: the results obtained indicate that the source of bacterial cell wall  plays no part in the chemical or structural requirements for pg to induce chronic cell wall arthritis in the rats; the chemical structure of the pg moiety is decisive.

TI  == human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the normal microbiota plays an important role in the health of the host, but little is known of how the human immune system recognizes and responds to gram-positive indigenous bacteria. we have investigated cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to gram-positive cell walls (cw) derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens  (eu.a. ), eubacterium limosum (eu.l.), lactobacillus casei (l.c.), and lactobacillus fermentum (l.f.). our results indicate that gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota can induce cytokine responses of the human pbmc. the profile, level and kinetics of these responses are similar to those induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) or cw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (s.p.). bacterial cw are capable of inducing production of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10, but not that of il-4 or interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). monocytes  are the main cell population in pbmc to produce tnf-alpha and il-10. induction of cytokine secretion is serum-dependent; both cd14-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. these findings suggest that the human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota are similar to those induced by lps or gram-positive cw of the pathogens.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == effect of dietary copper sulfate, aureo sp250, or clinoptilolite on ureolytic bacteria found in the pig large intestine.
AB  == the predominant ureolytic bacteria in the pig large intestine were determined while growing pigs were fed a basal diet or basal diet plus copper sulfate, aureo sp250, or clinoptilolite. fecal samples were collected from four pigs fed each diet at 3, 9, and 14 weeks and analyzed for total colony counts and percent ureolytic bacteria. fecal urease activity, ammonia nitrogen, and identity of the  ureolytic bacteria were determined at 14 weeks. copper sulfate and aureo sp250 reduced the number of ureolytic organisms, with a marked decrease occurring in the streptococcus spp., which made up 74% of the ureolytic isolates from the pigs on the basal diet. other ureolytic species detected at lower concentrations were  staphylococcus spp., selenomonas ruminantium, bacteroides multiacidus, and eubacterium limosum. copper sulfate also reduced fecal urease activity (p less than 0.10). fecal ammonia concentrations were not different between pigs fed the  various diets. these data suggest that the streptococci are the most numerous ureolytic species in the pig intestinal tract and are significantly reduced by copper sulfate and aureo sp250; however, only copper sulfate reduced intestinal urease activity.
