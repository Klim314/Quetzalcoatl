inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by crude and fractionated extract from lactic acid bacteria.
increasing levels of antibiotic resistance by staphylococcus aureus have posed a  need to search for non-antibiotic alternatives. this study aimed to assess the inhibitory effects of crude and fractionated cell-free supernatants (cfs) of locally isolated lactic acid bacteria (lab) against a clinical strain of s. aureus. a total of 42 lab strains were isolated and identified from fresh vegetables, fresh fruits and fermented products prior to evaluation of inhibitory activities. cfs of lab strains exhibiting a stronger inhibitive effect against s. aureus were fractionated into crude protein, polysaccharide and lipid fractions. crude protein fractions showed greater inhibition against s. aureus compared to polysaccharide and lipid fractions, with a more prevalent effect from lactobacillus plantarum 8513 and l. plantarum bt8513. crude protein, polysaccharide and lipid fractions were also characterised with glycine, mannose and oleic acid being detected as the major component of each fraction, respectively. scanning electron microscopy revealed roughed and wrinkled membrane morphology of s. aureus upon treatment with crude protein fractions of lab, suggesting an inhibitory effect via the destruction of cellular membrane. this research illustrated the potential application of fractionated extracts from lab to inhibit s. aureus for use in the food and health industry.
purification and characterization of plantaricin zj5, a new bacteriocin produced  by lactobacillus plantarum zj5.
the aim of this study is to investigate the antimicrobial potential of lactobacillus plantarum zj5, a strain isolated from fermented mustard with a broad range of inhibitory activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. here we present the peptide plantaricin zj5 (pzj5), which is an extreme ph and heat-stable. however, it can be digested by pepsin and proteinase k. this peptide has strong activity against staphylococcus aureus. pzj5 has been purified using a multi-step process, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interactions and reverse-phase chromatography. the molecular mass of the peptide was found to be 2572.9 da using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). the primary structure of this peptide was determined using amino acid sequencing and dna sequencing, and these analyses revealed that the dna sequence translated as a 44-residue precursor containing a 22-amino-acid n-terminal extension that was of the double-glycine type. the bacteriocin sequence exhibited no homology with known bacteriocins when compared with those available in the database, indicating that it was a new class iid bacteriocin. pzj5 from a food-borne strain may be useful as a promising probiotic candidate.
purification and characterisation of plantaricin zj008, a novel bacteriocin against staphylococcus spp. from lactobacillus plantarum zj008.
a novel bacteriocin, plantaricin zj008 produced by lactobacillus plantarum zj008  isolated from fresh milk, was purified by xad 2, cation exchange chromatograph, gel chromatograph, and rp-hplc. mass spectrometry based on maldi-tof indicated that the bacteriocin had a molecular of 1334.77 da. only five of twenty amino acids could be identified by edman degradation. this bacteriocin was highly thermostable (121 degrees c, 30 min) and exhibited narrow ph stability (ph 4.0-5.0). it was sensitive to alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and pepsin. however it still had 80% of activity after treatment by proteinase k. the action mode of this peptide functioned as bactericidal, but it did not lead to lysis of cells. this bacteriocin exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially staphylococcus spp. these results suggested that this bacteriocin appears potentially very useful to control and inhibit staphylococcus spp. in the food industry.
lipoteichoic acid from lactobacillus plantarum inhibits the expression of platelet-activating factor receptor induced by staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in human monocyte-like cells.
platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) plays an important role in bacterial infection and inflammation. we examined the effect of the bacterial cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from lactobacillus plantarum (plta) and staphylococcus aureus (alta) on pafr expression in thp-1, a monocyte-like cell line. lps and alta, but not plta, significantly increased pafr expression, whereas priming with plta inhibited lpsmediated or alta-mediated pafr expression. expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and 4, and cd14 increased with lps and alta treatments, but was inhibited by plta pretreatment. neutralizing antibodies against tlr2, tlr4, and cd14 showed that these receptors were important in lps-mediated or alta-mediated pafr expression. pafr expression is mainly regulated by the nuclear factor kappa b signaling pathway. blocking paf binding to pafr using a pafr inhibitor indicated that lps-mediated or alta-mediated paf expression affected tnf-alpha production. in the mouse small intestine, plta inhibited pafr, tlr2, and tlr4 expression that was induced by heat-labile toxin. our data suggested that plta has an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of pafr that was induced by pathogenic ligands.
plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (ppa) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by lactobacillus plantarum cect-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. the main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (pla) and lactic acid (la). the production of pla by l. plantarum cect-221 was evaluated in the man-rogosa-sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or ppa. using 30.5 mm ppa, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of pla producing 16.4 mm pla in 46 h. a concentration of 40 mm ppa was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. the biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of ppa; the average productivity of pla increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mm after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mm mm(-1); meanwhile, la reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g l(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that l. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. this is the first report of pla production from cheese whey and ppa. the extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
inhibition of staphylococcus aureus adherence to caco-2 cells by lactobacilli and cell surface properties that influence attachment.
staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize human and animal intestinal tracts, causing certain gastrointestinal diseases. the adherence of enteric pathogens to host intestinal epithelial cells is important for their pathogenesis. in the present study, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum were investigated in vitro to examine their ability to competitively exclude s. aureus. various factors involved in attachment, including bacterial status and cell concentration, growth phase, competition patterns, and surface-layer protein extracts, were also investigated. live lactobacilli in the mid-log growth phase exhibited maximum inhibitory activity when lactobacilli were pre- or co-incubated with s. aureus. however, the inhibitory activity was significantly reduced when the lactobacilli were inactivated by heating or treated with licl. furthermore, both lactobacilli possessed certain cell surface properties, such as hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation ability. l. salivarius and l. plantarum strongly inhibited s. aureus adherence to caco-2 cells and their inhibition activity was significantly influenced by several factors that affect adhesion inhibition.
inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by lysostaphin-expressing lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 in a modified genital tract secretion medium.
lactobacillus species are a predominant member of the vaginal microflora and are  critical in maintaining an acidic vaginal environment thought to contribute to the prevention of a number of urogenital diseases. however, during menstruation the ph of the vaginal environment increases to neutrality, a ph conducive for staphylococcus aureus proliferation and the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1) in susceptible women. in order to generate lactobacillus species capable of expressing lysostaphin (an endopeptidase that cleaves the cell wall of s. aureus) in a modified genital tract secretion medium (mgts) under neutral-ph conditions, six prominent proteins from lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 spent medium were identified by mass spectrometry. sequences for promoters, signal peptides, and mature lysostaphin were used to construct plasmids that were subsequently transformed into l. plantarum wcfs1. the promoter and signal sequences of lp_3014 (putatively identified as a transglycosylase) or the promoter sequence of lp_0789 (putatively identified as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) with the signal sequence of lp_3014 exhibited lysostaphin activity on buffered medium containing heat-killed s. aureus. the cassettes were integrated into the chromosome of l. plantarum wcfs1, but only the cassette containing the promoter and signal sequence from lp_3014 had integrated into the appropriate site. coculture assays using buffered mgts showed that lysostaphin expressed from l. plantarum wcfs1 reduced the growth of tsst-1-producing strains of s. aureus under neutral-ph conditions. this study provides the basis for determining whether lysostaphin-producing lactobacillus strains could potentially be used as a means to inhibit the growth of s. aureus during menstruation.
characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
aims: characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain, isolated from argentinian dry-fermented sausage. methods and results: lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. it was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the ph range from 5.0 to 6.0. consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. it was purified by rp (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and rp-hplc. plantaricin produced by lact. plantarum lp 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 da as determined by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. it was shown to have a bactericidal effect against pseudomonas sp., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes. conclusions: the bacteriocin produced by lact. plantarum lp 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. significance and impact of the study: in view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic ph), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
spectrum of bacteriocin activity of lactobacillus plantarum bs and fingerprinting by rapd-pcr.
the spectrum of antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus plantarum bs against representative bacterial species was established through deferred assay and 'spot-on-lawn' assay using actively growing cells and partially purified bacteriocin extract, respectively. only lactobacilli, pediococci, enterococci, bacilli and listeria were inhibited from the test microorganisms. slight bacteriocinogenic activity through 'spot-on-lawn' assay was detected against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli o157:h7. random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis was used to compare the fingerprint of l. plantarum bs with other strains of l. plantarum. using the 16s rrna-based primer, p32, the bacteriocinogenic isolate exhibited identical rapd-pcr fingerprints to l. plantarum atcc 14917. dendrograms derived from the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (upgma) were constructed to show the similarity relationships among the investigated strains based on rapd-pcr analysis. bands differentiating l. plantarum bs from l. plantarum atcc 14917 were also identified by varying the annealing temperature.
molecular analysis of the locus responsible for production of plantaricin s, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lpco10.
a 4.5-kb region of chromosomal dna carrying the locus responsible for the production of plantaricin s, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum lpco10 (r. jimenez-diaz, j. l. ruiz-barba, d. p. cathcart, h. holo, i. f. nes, k. h. sletten, and p. j. warner, appl. environ. microbiol. 61:4459-4463, 1995), has been cloned, and the nucleotide sequence has been elucidated. two genes, designated plsa and plsb and encoding peptides alpha and beta, respectively, of plantaricin s, plus an open reading frame (orf), orf2, were found to be organized in an operon. northern blot analysis showed that these genes are cotranscribed, giving a ca. 0.7-kb mrna, whose transcription start point was determined by primer extension. nucleotide sequences of plsa and plsb revealed that both genes are translated as bacteriocin precursors which include n-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. the role of orf2 is unknown at the moment, although it might be expected to encode an immunity protein of the type described for other bacteriocin operons. in addition, several other potential orfs have been found, including some which may be responsible for the regulation of bacteriocin production. two of them, orf8 and orf14, show strong homology with histidine protein kinase and response regulator genes, respectively, which have been found to be involved in the regulation of the production of other bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria. a third orf, orf5, shows homology with gene agrb from staphylococcus aureus, which is involved in the mechanism of regulation of the virulence phenotype in this species. thus, an agr-like regulatory system for the production of plantaricin s is postulated.
the gene encoding plantaricin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum c11,  is located on the same transcription unit as an agr-like regulatory system.
purification and amino acid sequencing of plantaricin a, a bacteriocin from lactobacillus plantarum c11, revealed that maximum bacteriocin activity is associated with the complementary action of two almost-identical peptides, alpha and beta (j. nissen-meyer, a. g. larsen, k. sletten, m. daeschel, and i. f. nes, j. gen. microbiol. 139:1973-1978, 1993). a 5-kb chromosomal hindiii restriction fragment containing the structural gene of plantaricin a was cloned and sequenced. only one gene encoding plantaricin a was found. the gene, termed plna, encodes a 48-amino-acid precursor peptide, of which the 22 and 23 c-terminal amino acids correspond to the purified peptides. northern (rna) blot analysis demonstrated that a probe complementary to the coding strand of the plantaricin a gene hybridized to a 3.3-kb mrna transcript. further analysis of the 3.3-kb transcript demonstrated that it contains three additional open reading frames (plnb, plnc and plnd) downstream of plna. the dna sequences of plnb, plnc, and plnd revealed that their products closely resemble members of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems. the strongest homology was found to the accessory gene regulatory (agr) system, which controls expression of exoproteins during post-exponential growth in staphylococcus aureus. the finding that plnabcd are transcribed from a common promoter suggests that the biological role played by the bacteriocin is somehow related to the regulatory function of the two-component system located on the same operon.
