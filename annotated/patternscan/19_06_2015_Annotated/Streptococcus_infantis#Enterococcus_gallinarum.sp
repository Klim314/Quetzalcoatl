TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers  with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. seven potential probiotics were found: lactobacillus fermentum strains f53 and kc5b, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, streptococcus bovis atcc 43143, enterococcus durans dsm 20633, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus faecalis. a comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. the degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. the human isolate l. fermentum kc5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at ph 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. this strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.
