TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. a total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. all were included in the safety analysis. clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18  (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. persisting organisms with amoxicillin included haemophilus influenzae (four), haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), escherichia coli (two), streptococcus pneumoniae (one), neisseria species (one), and proteus  mirabilis (one). adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. fleroxacin may be indicated for  the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due  to haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis. the 92% incidence of resistance among the s. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.

TI  == nonculture detection of haemophilus influenzae in sputum with monoclonal antibodies specific for outer membrane lipoprotein p6.
AB  == isolation of haemophilus influenzae from sputum is hampered by overgrowth by other microorganisms or by antibiotic treatment of the patient. to overcome this  problem in the detection of h. influenzae, an in situ immunoperoxidase staining technique was developed with monoclonal antibody (mab) 8bd9, immunoglobulin subclass g2a. mab 8bd9 appeared to be directed to an epitope on the outer membrane lipoprotein p6 of h. influenzae. the species specificity of mab 8bd9 was analyzed by staining isolates from different bacterial species. mab 8bd9 reacted  with all 300 h. influenzae strains tested and with h. aegyptius and h. haemolyticus. twenty-six of 30 h. parainfluenzae strains, other haemophilus species, and other bacterial species often isolated from sputum were not stained. the staining technique was compared with culture of 845 routinely obtained sputum samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. in 829 sputa (98.1%), the results of both techniques were in agreement; 173 were positive for h. influenzae, and 656 were negative. with 14 sputum samples, the staining method gave a positive result for h. influenzae, but the bacterium was not cultured. this could be ascribed to antibiotic treatment of the patient (n = 7), the presence of other mab 8bd9-positive haemophilus species in the sputum (n = 5), and overgrowth by swarming proteus mirabilis or by branhamella catarrhalis. in the immunoperoxidase- and gram-stained smears of two sputum samples, no bacteria  were seen, although some h. influenzae was cultured. on the basis of these results, we conclude that immunoperoxidase staining with mab 8bd9 is a fast and reliable extension of the available detection techniques for h. influenzae.

TI  == [clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == during 8 months from october 1986 to may 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them  (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6  with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis,  1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-streptococcus, 1 gram-positive cocci, 5 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, 7 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 branhamella catarrhalis, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1  salmonella subgenus i). bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. no  superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of got in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of  gpt in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. as an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, pivka ii was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. from the above results,  it appears that sbt/abpc is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.

TI  == in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu  per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and  branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd  117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to  date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic and clinical studies were conducted to evaluate cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a new cephem type antibiotic, in the pediatric field. a total of 9 pediatric patients (2-14 years) was treated with intravenous injection of czon: 4 cases with one shot of 20 mg/kg, 2 cases with one shot of 40 mg/kg and 3 cases with drip infusion over 1 hour of 40 mg/kg. czon concentrations in serum and the  excretion in urine were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 49.0, 22.7, 9.03, 2.13, 0.37, and 0.09 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. with 40  mg/kg one shot intravenous injections, mean serum concentrations were 117.5, 68.0, 26.2, 8.80, 0.63 and 0.19 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. with 40 mg/kg intravenous drip infusions over 1 hour, mean concentrations were 57.1, 78.8, 12.9, 1.12 and 0.23 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes,  1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. mean half-lives were 0.69 hour for 20 mg/kg one shot injections, 0.44 hour for 40 mg/kg one shot injections, and 0.58 hour for 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusions. urinary recovery rates in 6 hour after administration were 70.8% (mean) for the 20 mg/kg one shot injection, 44.1% (1 case) for the 40 mg/kg one shot injection, and 60.0% (mean) for the 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusion. czon was administered in 26 cases of pediatric infections, and the clinical efficacy, antibacterial activity, and side effects were evaluated. of the 26 cases 2 were excluded for the reason of not having bacterial infection, and the remaining 24 cases were assessed. included in the 24 cases were 16 cases of acute pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent lymphadenitis, and 1  case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent otitis media, acute apical periodontitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (ssss), acute pyelonephritis, and acute enteritis. clinical efficacy evaluation showed 19 excellent cases and 5 good cases, with an efficacy rate of 100%. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, beta-streptococcus 1 strain,  haemophilus influenzae 10 strains, haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain, proteus mirabilis 1 strain, and campylobacter jejuni 1 strain were determined or assumed  as pathogens, but all of them were eradicated.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
