TI  == conversion of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into their 7-oxo derivatives  by bacteroides intestinalis am-1 isolated from human feces.
AB  == secondary bile acid-producing bacteria were isolated from human feces to improve  our appreciation of the functional diversity and redundancy of the intestinal microbiota. in total, 619 bacterial colonies were isolated using a nutrient-poor  agar medium and the level of secondary bile acid formation was examined in each by a liquid culture, followed by thin-layer chromatography. of five strains analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and biochemical testing, one was identified  as bacteroides intestinalis am-1, which was not previously recognized as a secondary bile-acid producer. gc-ms revealed that b. intestinalis am-1 converts cholic acid (ca) and chenodeoxycholic acid into their 7-oxo derivatives, 7-oxo-deoxycholic acid (7-oxo-dca) and 7-oxo-lithocholic acid, respectively. thus, b. intestinalis am-1 possesses 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7alpha-hsdh) activity. in liquid culture, b. intestinalis am-1 showed a relatively higher productivity of 7-oxo-dca than escherichia coli hb101 and bacteroides fragilis jcm11019(t), which are known to possess 7alpha-hsdh activity. the level of 7alpha-hsdh activity was higher in b. intestinalis am-1 than in the other two strains under the conditions tested. the 7alpha-hsdh activity in each of the three strains is not induced by ca; instead, it is regulated in a growth phase-dependent manner.

TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
