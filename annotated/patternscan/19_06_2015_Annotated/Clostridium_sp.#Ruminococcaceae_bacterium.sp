TI  == mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov.: a novel bacterium isolated from the female genital tract.
AB  == three isolates of a bacterium recovered from human endometrium using conventional culture methods were characterized biochemically and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. isolates were non-motile, obligately anaerobic, non-spore forming, asaccharolytic, non-cellulolytic, indole positive,  gram positive rods. cell wall fatty acid profiling revealed c14:0, c16:0, c18:2 omega6, 9c, c18:1 omega9c and c18:0 to be the major fatty acid composition. the dna mol % g+c was determined to be 44.2%. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed only 91% sequence similarity with the closest cultivated bacterial isolate, saccharofermentans acetigenes. based on genotypic and phenotypic data, all three isolates are considered to be members of the same species and data suggest it represents a novel genus and species in the order clostridiales with an association with clostridium rrna cluster iii within the family ruminococcaceae. we propose the name, mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain is baa-2120(t) and ccug 59143(t).
