TI  == antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of ranunculus arvensis  l. extracts.
AB  == to investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of methanol extract (me), water extract (we), acetone extract (ae), chloroform extract (ce), methanol-water extract (mwe), methanol-acetone extract (mae), methanol-chloroform extract (mce) of ranunculus arvensis (l.). antitumor activity was evaluated with agrobacterium tumefaciens (at10) induced potato disc assay. cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, bordetella  bronchiseptica, klebsiella pneumoniae, micrococcus luteus and streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including aspergillus niger, a. flavus, a. fumigates, fusarium solani and mucor species by  using disc diffusion method. best antitumor activity was obtained with me and we, having highest ic50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. brine shrimp lethality assay showed lc50 values of ae, mae and me were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. we of r. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. on the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. these findings demonstrate that extracts  of r. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. further extensive study  is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  == cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to escherichia coli (two bacteremic), pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, or streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were  clinically cured, but one relapse (s. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. six patients with cystitis due to e. coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, p. aeruginosa, or s. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both,  occurred in five due to p. aeruginosa, s. faecalis, c. fruendii, or e. coli. neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to hemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, or neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but p. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. eight soft tissue infections due to staphylococcus aureus, peptococcus prevotti,  streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to s. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for s. aureus occurred in one. granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. possible side effects require further study.
