TI  == efficacy and safety of lomefloxacin on bacterial extraocular disease in the horse.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic used for the treatment of bacterial extraocular disease. this study investigated the efficacy  and safety of lomefloxacin eye drops for bacterial extraocular disease in horses. lomefloxacin ophthalmic solution (0.3%) was instilled three times daily for 2-5 days in 65 horses diagnosed with bacterial extraocular disease based on clinical  findings. clinical observations and bacteriological examinations were performed at the start of treatment, 2 and 5 days after the start of treatment, and at the  discontinuation or termination of treatment. of the 65 horses, 64 were positive for bacteria, and 22 bacterial genera and 47 bacterial species were identified. the efficacy of lomefloxacin was evaluated in 63 horses; one horse with a negative culture and another with suspected bacterial contamination were excluded. lomefloxacin was considered to be clinically effective in 54 horses. the major bacterial species identified were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus  equi subsp. zooepidemicus, acinetobacter lwoffii, staphylococcus xylosus, staphylococcus vitulinus, enterobacter agglomerans, flavimonas oryzihabitans and  staphylococcus sciuri, with a cumulative disappearance rate of 80% or more at the termination of instillation. excluding one horse that did not undergo a bacteriological examination, the remaining 62 horses were assessed for bacteriological outcome. full or partial bacterial clearance was detected in 95%  or more of the 62 horses. one of the 65 horses reported adverse events that had no causal relation with the eye drops. our results showed that lomefloxacin is safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial extraocular disease in horses.

TI  == microbial contamination of glaucoma eyedrops used by patients compared with ocular medications used in the hospital.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the percentage of contamination of multiuse  eyedrops applied by glaucoma patients at home and by the medical personnel at the outpatient department, the ward, and the operating room of our department of ophthalmology. eyedrops were collected over a period of 11 months. samples were taken from the dropper tip (smear), drops, and the residual fluid inside the bottle and cultivated on blood agar. colony forming units were counted and identified by mass spectrometry. the percentage of contamination was significantly higher in eyedrops applied by the patients (29/119; 24.4%, p < 0.01), used in the ward (26/133; 19.5%, p < 0.01), and in the outpatient unit (6/35; 17.1%, p = 0.036) compared with that in the operating room (6/113; 5.3%).  the median period of use was 1 week in the operating room compared with 4 weeks in the other groups (p < 0.01). glaucoma medications were significantly more frequently contaminated than antibiotic and anesthetic eyedrops (p < 0.05). for eyedrops applied by the patients, the tip was more frequently contaminated than the drops and the residual internal fluid. for eyedrops from the ward, the opposite was true. pathogenic strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and staphylococcus aureus) were found only in 6 bottles (1.5%), whereas most of the detected microbes belonged to human or environmental flora. this study underlines the importance of hygienic handling of eyedrops and raises the question of whether single-use glaucoma medication might be preferred to reduce the risk of contamination.

TI  == prevalence and bacteriology of bacteremia associated with cleft lip and palate surgery.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and bacteriology of bacteremia associated with cleft lip and palate (clp) surgery. three venous blood samples were obtained from 90 eligible subjects who presented for clp surgery: before surgical incision, 1 minute after placement of the last suture, and 15 minutes thereafter. the samples were injected into an oxoid signal blood culture  and transported to the laboratory for gram-positive/negative and aerobic/anaerobic bacteria analysis. prevalence of bacteremia associated with cleft surgery was 38.1%. prevalence rates of bacteremia in cleft lip surgery, cleft palate surgery, and alveoloplasty were 40.9%, 33.3%, and 50%, respectively. there was no significant difference in prevalence rate of positive blood culture  in cleft lip surgery, cleft palate surgery, and alveoloplasty (p = 0.69). positive blood culture was detected most frequently (47%) 1 minute after placement of the last suture. of the 23 subjects who had positive blood culture at 1 minute, bacteremia persisted in 8 (35%) of them after 15 minutes. the most common bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococcus, acinetobacter lwoffii, and coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus. sex and age of the subjects, duration of surgery, blood loss, and type of cleft surgery were not significantly associated with positive blood culture. bacteremia associated with  clp surgery is polymicrobial and persisted for at least 15 minutes after surgery  in 35% of cases. this may reinforce the need for prophylactic antibiotics to protect at-risk patients from developing focal infection of the heart by oral flora.

TI  == emerging threat of multidrug resistant bugs--acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (mdr) acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) constitute a worldwide pandemic. without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. methods: this study was conducted to identify the status of mdr acinetobacter spp. and mrsa in a tertiary care centre of nepal. sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following  standard microbiological methods recommended by the american society for microbiology (asm). double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in acinetobacter isolates. methicillin resistance in s. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. results: different genomespecies of acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and a. lwoffii.  around 95% of acinetobacter isolates were mdr, while 12.9% were esbl-producer. of the total 33 isolates of s. aureus, 26 (78.8%) were mdr and 14 (42.4%) were methicillin resistant. conclusions: a large number of mdr acinetobacter spp. and  mrsa has been noted in this study. the condition is worsened by the emergence of  esbl producing acinetobacter spp. hence, judicious use of antimicrobials is mandatory in clinical settings. moreover, there should be vigilant surveillance of resistant clones in laboratories.

TI  == effects of sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide on bacterial growth in in vitro culture conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the role of sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide on bacterial growth under conditions in vitro similar to those of clinical  practice. we assessed these effects on pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter lwoffii, and staphylococcus aureus growth. bacterial inoculums were prepared from reference strains in nutritive broth. airtight chambers were filled with bacterial suspensions. each strain was studied with and without exposure to sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide at baseline, after 1 and 3 h. serial dilutions and agar plates were made and the colonies were counted. p. aeruginosa were grown after exposure to the nitrous oxide alone (2.8 x 10(3) colony-forming units/ml; cfu ml(-1)) after 3 h according to the control (p < 0.05). a. lwoffii were grown  after exposure to the nitrous oxide and sevoflurane with nitrous oxide (8.7 x 10(3) and 8.0 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) (p < 0.05), respectively. there were no changes in s. aureus growth in controls and anesthesia groups. we conclude that the effects of anesthetic agents on bacterial growth may change owing to the type of  anesthetic and microorganism.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [a clinical evaluation of sultamicillin fine granules in the treatment of meibomianitis].
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. a dose of 375 mg sbtpc granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. the results obtained are summarized as follows. efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. no side effects were observed throughout the study. the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria such as  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative staphylococcus and streptococcus sanguis, and gram-negative bacteria such as alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, alcaligenes denitrificans subsp.  xylosoxidans, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter lwoffii. a bacteriological study showed lower mics of sbtpc than those of ampicillin (abpc), suggesting that sbtpc has more potent antibacterial activity than abpc. such bacteriological activity of sbtpc was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to abpc or cefaclor.
