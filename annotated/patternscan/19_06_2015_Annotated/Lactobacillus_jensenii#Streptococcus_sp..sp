TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == association between the vaginal microbiota, menopause status, and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy.
AB  == objective: the vaginal microbiota helps protect the female genital tract from disease. we sought to describe the composition of the vaginal microbiota in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women and to explore the association between the microbiota and vulvovaginal atrophy (vva). methods: eighty-seven women (aged 35-60 y) were classified as premenopausal (n = 30), perimenopausal (n = 29), or postmenopausal (n = 28) according to stages of reproductive aging workshop guidelines. midvaginal bacterial community composition was characterized by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis. results: bacterial communities clustered into six community state types (csts), of which four were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, or lactobacillus jensenii, and two (cst iv-a and cst iv-b) had low relative abundance of lactobacillus. cst iv-a was characterized by streptococcus and prevotella, whereas cst iv-b was characterized by atopobium. there were significant associations between menopause stage and cst (p = 0.004) and between vva and cst (p = 0.002). perimenopausal women were more likely to be  classified as cst iv-a or l. gasseri cst, whereas postmenopausal women were often classified as cst iv-a. csts dominated by l. crispatus and l. iners were more prevalent in premenopausal women. nineteen participants had signs of mild or moderate vva. compared with women with no vva, the vaginal microbiota of women with mild or moderate atrophy had 25-fold greater odds of being classified as cst iv-a versus l. crispatus cst (adjusted odds ratio, 25.89; 95% credible interval,  2.98-406.79). conclusions: a distinct bacterial community state (cst iv-a) with a low relative abundance of lactobacillus is associated with vva. future studies recruiting a larger number of women are needed to replicate the findings. this study provides an impetus for future longitudinal studies designed to manage, modulate, and restore vaginal microbiota homeostasis, which would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship with vva and ultimately improve the treatment and prevention of atrophic vaginitis in menopause.

TI  == influence of vaginal bacteria and d- and l-lactic acid isomers on vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer: implications for protection against upper genital tract infections.
AB  == we evaluated levels of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) in vaginal secretions in relation  to the composition of vaginal bacterial communities and d- and l-lactic acid levels. the composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 46 women was determined by pyrosequencing the v1 to v3 region of 16s rrna genes. lactobacilli  were dominant in 71.3% of the women, followed by gardnerella (17.4%), streptococcus (8.7%), and enterococcus (2.2%). of the lactobacillus-dominated communities, 51.5% were dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, 36.4% by lactobacillus iners, and 6.1% each by lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. concentrations of l-lactic acid were slightly higher in lactobacillus-dominated vaginal samples, but most differences were not statistically significant. d-lactic acid levels were higher in samples containing l. crispatus than in those with l. iners (p<0.0001) or gardnerella (p=0.0002). the relative proportion of d-lactic acid in vaginal communities dominated by species of lactobacilli was in concordance with the proportions found in axenic cultures of the various species grown in vitro. levels of l-lactic acid (p<0.0001) and the ratio of l-lactic acid to d-lactic acid (p=0.0060), but not concentrations of d-lactic acid, were also correlated with emmprin concentrations. moreover, vaginal concentrations of emmprin and mmp-8 levels were highly correlated (p<0.0001). taken together, the data suggest the relative proportion of l- to d-lactic acid isomers in the vagina may influence the extent  of local emmprin production and subsequent induction of mmp-8. the expression of  these proteins may help determine the ability of bacteria to transverse the cervix and initiate upper genital tract infections. importance: a large proportion of preterm births (>50%) result from infections caused by bacteria originating in the vagina, which requires that they traverse the cervix. factors  that influence susceptibility to these infections are not well understood; however, there is evidence that matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-8) is known to alter the integrity of the cervix. in this work, we show that concentrations of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (emmprin) are influenced by members of the vaginal microbial community and concentrations of d- or l-lactic acid isomers in vaginal secretions. elevated levels of d-lactic acid and the ratio of d- to l-lactic acid influence emmprin concentrations as well as mmp-8 levels. thus, isomers of lactic acid may function as signaling molecules that alter host gene expression and influence risk of infection-related preterm birth.

TI  == interactions of lactobacilli with pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == objective: to determine whether (1) a decreased concentration of lactobacilli allows s. pyogenes to grow; (2) s. pyogenes is able to grow in the presence of healthy lactobacillus concentrations; (3) s. pyogenes is capable of inhibiting lactobacilli. methods: one hundred fifty patient samples of s. pyogenes were mixed with four different concentrations of l. crispatus and l. jensenii. colony  counts and ph measurements were taken from these concentrations and compared using t-tests and anova statistical analyses. results: statistical tests showed no significant difference between the colony counts of s. pyogenes by itself and  growth when mixed with lactobacilli, and no significant difference between the colony counts of s. pyogenes in the four different concentrations of lactobacilli. conclusion: the statistical data representing the growth of these two organisms suggests that lactobacilli did not inhibit the growth of s. pyogenes. also, s. pyogenes did not inhibit the growth of lactobacilli.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == effect of using propionic acid bacteria as an adjunct culture in yogurt production.
AB  == propionibacteria are able to produce a wide variety of food components beneficial to human health. in this study, yogurt was produced by using the adjunct starter  cultures propionibacterium jensenii b1264 and propionibacterium thoenii (jensenii) p126. although the total solids and protein contents of the yogurts did not show any significant differences, titratable acidity of the control sample (yc-380) remained lower than that of propionibacterium spp.-supplemented yogurts during 15 d of storage. the yogurts produced by yc-380 + p126 cultures had the firmest structure (0.26 n). the highest acetaldehyde (29.35 mg/kg) content was obtained with yogurt made with yc-380 + p126 + b1264 on d 1. the addition of propionibacteria to yogurt did not have any negative effect on the counts of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in yogurt. during the first week of storage, propionibacteria counts remained high, suggesting that yogurt provided a good environment for these organisms. this new product would provide not only beneficial health effects, but also a new alternative product to plain set-type yogurt.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == antimicrobial components of vaginal fluid.
AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.
