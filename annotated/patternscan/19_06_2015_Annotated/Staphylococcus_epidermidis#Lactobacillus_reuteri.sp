TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic lactobacillus, staphylococcus and streptococcus species.
AB  == human symbiotic bacteria, lactobacillus reuteri (lr) in the intestines, staphylococcus epidermidis (se) in skin and streptococcus salivalis (ss) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (dh-dg) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (pg) and cardiolipin (cl), together with mono-  to tetrahexaosyl dgs. the molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the dg moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for lr, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for se, and 16:0 and 18:1 for ss, respectively. the carbohydrate structures of dh-dgs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being galalpha1-2glcalpha for lr, glcbeta1-6glcbeta for se, and glcalpha1-2glcalpha for ss, respectively. also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. anti-l. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs, in which galalpha was bound to dh-dg through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with dh-dg from lr. although anti-se antiserum preferentially reacted with dh-dg from se, anti-ss antiserum reacted with dh-dg from ss and, to a lesser extent, with dh-dgs from lr and se. but, both anti-se and anti-ss antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl dg or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. in addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the abo blood group, were found to contain igm to tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs from lr, but not to dh-dgs from lr, se and ss.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus reuteri on the proliferation of propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == while it is generally accepted that propionibacterium acnes is involved in the development of acne, other bacteria including staphylococcus epidermidis have also been isolated from the acne lesion. the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and acnegenic bacteria is unclear. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of p. acnes and s. epidermidis. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of p. acnes and s. epidermidis. the proliferation of p. acnes was decreased by 2-log scales after incubation with l.  reuteri for 24 h. in addition, the proliferation of s. epidermidis was decreased  by 3-log scales after incubation with l. reuteri for 24 h, whereas the growth of  l. reuteri was unaffected by p. acnes or s. epidermidis. among the l. reuteri strains examined, l. reuteri kctc 3679 had the strongest inhibitory effect on the growth of p. acnes and s. epidermidis, followed by l. reuteri kctc 3594 and l. reuteri kctc 3678. interestingly, reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. the most pronounced the antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be a useful probiotic agent to control the growth of bacteria involved in acne inflammation and prevent acne.

TI  == characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  == anti-lactobacillus johnsonii (lj) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with lj reacted with glyceroglycolipids in lj, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (dh-dg), trihexaosyl dg (th-dg) and tetrahexaosyl dg (teth-dg), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. structural analyses of glycolipids from lj revealed that dh-dg was galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, and th-dg and teth-dg were novel derivatives of it with alpha-gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and galalpha1-6galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, respectively. dh-dg was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but teth-dg was restricted to lj, l. intestinalis and l. reuteri, while the th-dgs from l. casei were glc1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and an esterified derivative of it, glc1-6galalpha1-2glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'dg, as reported in the literature. anti-lj antisera reacted with th-dg and esterified th-dg from l. casei to lesser  extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl dg from staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl dg from streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-gal residues. the major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. also, human igm antibodies against th-dg and teth-dg from  lj were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an  immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, th-dg and teth-dg.

TI  == detection of bacterial contamination in cultures of eucaryotic cells by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  == the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for early detection of bacterial  contaminations in cultures of baker's yeast, penicillium chrysogenum, and an animal cell line was evaluated; muramic acid and characteristic cellular fatty acids were used as analytes. by analyzing branched-chain and cyclopropane-substituted fatty acids as methyl esters, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus reuteri, enterobacter cloacae, and  pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in a 500-fold excess (w/w) of baker's yeast; the amounts injected corresponded to 300 ng (dry mass) of the bacteria. contamination with bacillus was detected in cultures of penicillium chrysogenum and animal cells by analyzing muramic acid, both as its alditol acetate derivative, using electron impact ionization, and its trifluoroacetyl methyl glycoside derivative, using negative ion-chemical ionization. the trifluoroacetylated derivative was detected in injected amounts corresponding to  1 x 10(3) bacterial cells in the contaminated animal cell line, whereas amounts corresponding to 1 x 10(5) bacteria were required for detection of the alditol acetate derivative; the amounts in the original samples were 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6), respectively. however, the alditol acetate method exhibited lower chemical interferences than the trifluoroacetyl methyl glycoside procedure. the results show the potential of using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of cellular constituents for the detection of bacterial contaminations in eucaryotic cultures as an alternative to conventional microbiological methods.
