TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == [identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  maldi-tof ms system].
AB  == bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. maldi-tof ms (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time- of- flight mass spectrometry)  system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the maldi-tof ms system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture  bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. a total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by gram stain were evaluated. these blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between december 2013-february 2014. conventional methods and bd phoenix automated bacterial identification system (becton dickinson, usa) were used for routine identification. the strains were also identified by real-time taqman pcr (qpcr) which was considered as the reference method. in maldi-tof ms method, maldi sepsityper kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using microflex lt instrument and flexcontrol 3.0 software (bruker daltonics, usa). of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci,  90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qpcr, bd phoenix, bruker maldi-tof ms). the other six samples were identified as enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both phoenix and the maldi-tof systems. of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at  the species level (15 s.aureus, 33 s.epidermidis, 29 s.hominis, 10 s.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qpcr method. when comparing the results obtained by qpcr and bruker maldi-tof ms, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. those isolates were identified as s.hominis by qpcr, however two of them were identified as s.haemolyticus and one as s.epidermidis by maldi-tof ms. compared with real-time taqman pcr it was detected that bruker maldi tof ms was identified 100% of s.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) to the genus and species level, respectively. in conclusion, it was thought that bruker maldi  tof ms system may allow rapid and reliable identification of s.aureus and cns directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == predictors of quantitative microbiological analysis of spatter and aerosolization during scaling.
AB  == the aim of this study is to analyze the infection risk through spatter and aerosolization during scaling and to create a prediction model of the total number of hemolytic bacteria. material and methods: air samples were collected prior to patient's arrival and spatter and aerosol samples were collected during  scaling procedure in 80 patients of 4 different dental clinics. the dentists calculated di, ci, dmft. only patients with ci > = 1 were included. the bacteriological results (cfu/m3) were correlated with clinical indicators. patients were divided into 2 groups: one that rinse with sterile water and the other with chlohexidine mouth rinse 0.1%. results and conclusions: medium size effect positive correlations were found between the number of decayed teeth and the total number of bacteria and the total number of hemolytic bacteria that grew on plate attached to the dentist's mask. the mean number of bacteria and the mean number of hemolytic bacteria that grew on plate attached to the dentist's mask were significantly lower in the group that rinse with chlorhexidine 0.1%, when compared to the group that rinsed with sterile water. when controlling for the total number of bacteria and the total number of hemolytic bacteria from air sampling, the total number of hemolytic bacteria that grew on the plate attached  to the dentist's mask can be predicted by ci, group membership and dmft score.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == sample preparation of gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == [a new device for the disinfection of handpieces and turbines].
AB  == dental handpieces are often difficult to disinfect. this is one of the main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. the aim  of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. the following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used.  the method described by the european committee for standardization was followed.  test microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental handpieces (69 contra-angles and 97 turbines of different  marks). they were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group a), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results of the first experiment  showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. a great proportion of the dental  handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84% through 89% out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89% through 100% out of the models of contra-angle handpieces. even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10(3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. the results of the third experiment were unclear. the tested instrument reduced 10(5)-10(8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes) were used. on the other hand, when pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10(6)-10(7) times in some cases, and only 10(2) times in other cases. this difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. in conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin rp 59500.
AB  == the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of rp 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes. a 30 min exposure of staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of rp 59500 produced a pae of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a pae of 3.2-8  h. a 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of rp 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a pae of 2.5-7.5 h. paes of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the paes of highly susceptible isolates. a 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of rp 59500 produced a pae of 7.5-9.5 h for streptococcus pneumoniae and a pae of greater than 18 h for streptococcus pyogenes. rp 59500 produced a longer pae with staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. these results suggest that rp 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == treatment of bone and soft tissue infections with teicoplanin.
AB  == the use of teicoplanin was evaluated in a group of 33 patients, which included 18 prosthetic infections, seven with osteomyelitis, five skin and soft tissue infections, and three cases of septic arthritis. the bacterial pathogens isolated were 27 isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive 18; methicillin  resistant 9), staph. hominis (2), staph. epidermidis (1), staph. haemolyticus (2), enterococcus faecalis (1), streptococcus pyogenes (1), peptococcus spp. (1). eleven patients had polymicrobial infections (gram-positive plus gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria). in ten cases (nine polymicrobial infections) teicoplanin was used in combination with other antibiotics. teicoplanin was administered intravenously 400 mg every 24 h in 26 cases, 200 mg every 24 h in six cases and 600 mg every 24 h in one case. the duration of the treatment ranged from 9 to 73 days with a mean of 27.3. efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients, because in three patients treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions. cure or improvement was noted in 28 patients (93%). bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (83.3%).

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == factors causing the clumping reaction of streptococcal strains with human plasma.
AB  == fresh isolates of 204 strains of streptococcus haemolyticus, 75 strains of viridans group streptococcus, and 45 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae were studied for their clumping reactions with human plasma. the plasma and serum factors that clumped the streptococcal strains were compared with those that clumped a staphylococcus aureus strain. one hundred eleven strains of s. haemolyticus, 10 strains of viridans group streptococcus, and none of the strains of s. pneumoniae tested were clumped by human plasma. however, clumping activity  was remarkably unstable after subculturing on plates containing todd-hewitt blood agar. the strain with the highest level of activity was clumped by fibrinogen and normal human serum. results of tests of the clumping reactions of staphylococci and streptococci with human serum indicated that the serum factors responsible for those reactions may be identical.

TI  == endophthalmitis following cataract extraction. a study of 24 cases in 4,498 operations.
AB  == the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis in a series of 4,498 consecutive cataract operations, performed in a period of 10 years, was examined and found to equal 0.533%. paracentesis of the anterior chamber was done in two cases and revealed staphylococcus albus to be the causative organism in both instances. conjunctival cultures were recovered in a further 17 cases, and showed s. albus in pure culture in eight cases and in combination with pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteous morgani in two cases. streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in pure culture in one case, while the cultures from six other patients were negative. the role of such factors as age, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, "weak ocular tissue", and persurgical complications which predisposed to postoperative  infections was examined and found to have no significance on the occurrence of endophthalmitis in the present study. the visual end results were assessed and showed a better prognosis than generally expected. of 24 cases, five achieved good visual acuity (6/6-6/12), 13 had a useful vision (6/18-6/60), while five remained actually blind (less than 6/60). in only one case was the eye enucleated. methods of treatment and prophylaxis are described and discussed. a total suppression or elimination of all regional bacteria at the time of surgery  seems to be the logical goal.
