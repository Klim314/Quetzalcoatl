(z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumonia), enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of m. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. results: the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were observed by the aqueous extracts of m. longifolia. conclusions: in conclusion, it seems that z. multiflora and m. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of salvia x jamensis essential oil.
this is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of salvia x jamensis. the major compounds identified by gc-ms were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). the oil showed antimicrobial activity against three gram (+) bacteria: bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis, and three candida strains: c. albicans, c. glabrata and c. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three gram (-) bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae.
mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamase generated from beta-lactam antibiotics.
the resistance of bacteria to the normally lethal action of beta-lactam antibiotics is largely due to the production of beta-lactamases that catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam. one class of these enzymes is a zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamase for which there are no clinically available inhibitors. the hydrolysis of cephalosporin beta-lactam antibiotics generates dihydrothiazines which subsequently undergo isomerization at c6 by c-s bond cleavage and through the intermediacy of a thiol. these thiols can be trapped by the beta-lactamase from bacillus cereus, causing inhibition of the enzyme. the rate of production of the thiol corresponds to the rate of inhibition, and the inhibition constants are in the micromolar range but vary with the nature of the cephalosporin derivative. nmr studies have identified the structure of the thiols causing inhibition and also show that the thiol binds to the zinc ion, which in turn perturbs the metal-bound histidines. inhibition is slowly removed as the thiol becomes oxidized or undergoes further degradation. the thiol intermediate generated from cephalothin is a slow binding inhibitor. there is no observed inhibition from the analogous degradation products from penicillins.
antibacterial activity of helichrysum aureonitens (asteraceae).
the antibacterial activity of extracts from helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. the dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against bacillus cereus, b. pumilus and micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. none of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
isolation and characterization of a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from streptomyces clavuligerus and cloning and analysis of the corresponding gene.
culture filtrates of streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor (blip) in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds. blip was first detected by its ability to inhibit bactopenase, a penicillinase derived from bacillus cereus, but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid puc- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of escherichia coli. blip showed no inhibitory effect against enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase, and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of b. cereus penicillinase. blip was purified to homogeneity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for blip of 16,900 to 18,000. the interaction between purified blip and the e. coli(puc) beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent, with an estimated 1:1 molar stoichiometry. the blip gene was isolated on a 13.5-kilobase fragment of s. clavuligerus chromosomal dna which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of dna known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis. the gene encoded a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues (calculated molecular weight of 17,523) and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence. no significant sequence similarity to blip was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments, and no blip activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other streptomyces spp.
beta-lactamase evaluation of the amoxycillin-clavulanate association.
the capability of potassium clavulanate to protect amoxycillin from destruction by three partially purified beta-lactamases (from e. cloacae, b. cereus 569/h9 and e. coli r-tem) was evaluated. the enzymatic inhibition was determined spectrophotometrically by assessing the ability of either amoxycillin or potassium clavulanate or their combination (at a 7:1 ratio by weight) to prevent the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (nitrocefin) after different pre-incubation times, thus determining the ic50 and ki values. potassium clavulanate significantly reduced the ic50 values of amoxycillin for b. cereus and tem enzymes by a factor ranging from 500 to 1200, by inhibiting these beta-lactamases at concentrations ranging from 4 to 0.008 microm. however, clavulanic acid was quite ineffective against type i enzymes (from e. cloacae), while amoxycillin was found to be sufficiently stable (ic50 of 0.8-1.4 microm).
