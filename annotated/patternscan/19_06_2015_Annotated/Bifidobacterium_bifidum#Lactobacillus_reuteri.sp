TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == probiotic administration modifies the milk fatty acid profile, intestinal morphology, and intestinal fatty acid profile of goats.
AB  == the effect of a mixture of potentially probiotic bacteria (mppb; lactobacillus reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39, and bifidobacterium bifidum strains) on the milk fatty acid (fa) profile, with emphasis on cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in the middle stage of  goat lactation, was determined. in addition, the effects of mppb feeding on the fa profile in intestinal content and intestinal morphology in weaned goats were analyzed. the probiotic supplement was able to modify fa composition of milk and  intestinal content. the unsaturated fa concentrations in milk (g of fa/l of milk) increased from 4.49 to 7.86 for oleic (18:1), from 0.70 to 1.39 for linoleic (18:2), from 0.063 to 0.187 for linolenic (18:3) acid, and from 0.093 to 0.232 for cla. the atherogenicity index diminished 2-fold after mppb ingestion. in the  intestinal content of the weaned goats, no significant difference in saturated fa concentration compared with the control was observed. however, oleic acid, linolenic acid, cla, and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations increased by 81, 23, 344, and 74%, respectively, after probiotic consumption. the ruminal production of cla was increased by the mppb. however, bacterial strains of mppb were unable  to produce cla in culture media. by histological techniques, it was observed that the treated group had intestinally more conserved morphological structures than the control group. the results obtained in this study indicate that the mppb administration in lactating and weaned goats allows for the production of milk with improved concentrations of beneficial compounds, and also produces a protective effect in the goat intestine. the results obtained in this study reinforce the strategy of probiotics application to enhance goat health with the  production of milk with higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fa.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == potential of goat probiotic to bind mutagens.
AB  == the mutagen binding ability of the goat probiotics (lactobacillus reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39, and bifidobacterium bifidum ddba) was evaluated. the oral administration of these probiotics reduced fecal mutagens and intestinal cancer markers in goats. secondly, the effects of probiotics against the mutagenesis induced by sodium azide (sa), and benzopyrene (b[alpha]p) by performing the modified ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was investigated. the capacity to bind benzopyrene and the stability of the bacterial-mutagen complex was analyzed by hplc. the dismutagenic potential against both mutagens was proportional to probiotic concentration. results showed that probiotic antimutagenic capacity against sa was ranging from 13 to 78%. the mixture of four goat probiotics (mgp)  displayed higher antimutagenic activity against sa than any individual strains at the same cell concentration. this study shows that the highest diminution of mutagenicity in presence of b[alpha]p (74%) was observed in presence of mgp. the  antimutagenic activity of nearly all the individual probiotic and the mgp were in concordance with the b[alpha]p binding determined by hplc. according to our results, the b[alpha]p binding to probiotic was irreversible still after being washed with dmso solution. the stability of the toxic compounds-bacterial cell binding is a key consideration when probiotic antimutagenic property is evaluated. mgp exhibits the ability to bind and detoxify potent mutagens, and this property can be useful in supplemented foods for goats since it can lead to  the removal of potent mutagens and protect and enhance ruminal health and hence food safety of consumers.

TI  == polysaccharide from seeds of plantago asiatica l. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  == polysaccharide from the seeds of plantago asiatica l. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on  mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. it was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). furthermore, the effect of the  polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the  control group. bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics bifidobacterium bifidum , lactobacillus fermentum , and lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. these indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from p.  asiatica l. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == mucosal immunology and probiotics.
AB  == the cross-talk between the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota is critical in mucosal tissue homeostasis as well as in protection against infectious and inflammatory diseases occurring at mucosal sites. this recent evidence has paved the way to therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the mucosa-associated immune system using probiotics. different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate dendritic cell (dc) activation, polarizing the subsequent t cell activity toward th1 (e.g. lactobacillus (lb) acidophilus),  th2 (lb.reuteri and bifidobacterium bifidum) or, as more recently demonstrated, th17 responses induced by specific strains such as lb.rhamnosus gg and lac23a, the latter isolated in our laboratory. here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of probiotics effects on mucosal immunology, particularly on cells of the innate immunity such as dcs. we also highlight our own experiences in modulating dc functions by commensal bacteria and discuss the relevance of probiotics administration in the treatment of human immunopathologies.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotic administration effect on fecal mutagenicity and microflora in the goat's gut.
AB  == the application of potentially beneficial microorganisms to increase host defense is a new trend to increase health benefits. in this paper the first specific host probiotics for goats from a mixture isolated from healthy animals (lactobacillus  reuteri ddl 19, lactobacillus alimentarius ddl 48, enterococcus faecium dde 39 and bifidobacterium bifidum ddba) was assayed. the effect of probiotic oral administration on goats' weight, gut microbiota, as well as on the production of  mutagen compounds and their indicator (putrescine), were evaluated. the probiotic supplement was able to modify microflora balance by reducing enterobacteria like  salmonella/shigella (1.09 and 1.21 log cfu/g feces, respectively) and increasing  lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (1.67 and 2.34 log cfu/g feces, respectively). the probiotics administration was correlated with a ten time diminution of fecal putrescine (cancer and bacterial disease marker) and a decrease of 60% mutagen fecal concentration, indicating the protective effect of  the treatment. additionally, a significant increase in ruminant weight was observed after probiotic administration. these results are encouraging towards the use of probiotic mixtures as functional food for goats.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == a differential medium for lactic acid-producing bacteria in a mixed culture.
AB  == aims: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue (mmrs-bpb) was tested as a medium for counting and differentiation of each lactic acid-producing bacterium (lab), especially in a mixed culture. methods and results: type strains of 10 lab species (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis, l. bulgaricus, l. gasseri, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. reuteri, weissella confusa, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. infantis) and five commercial yogurts were inoculated on plate count agar with bromocresol purple, mmrs, and mmrs-bpb.  each type strain showed more clearly formed colonies on the three media under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. especially each type strain produced colonies with specific characteristics of each species on mmrs-bpb. commercial yogurts produced the largest number of colonies with various shapes and colours on mmrs-bpb. conclusions: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue under anaerobic conditions is appropriate for counting and differentiating each lab in a mixed culture. significance and impact of the study: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue will  be useful in isolation and enumeration of each lab from fermented foods as well as intestinal microflora.

TI  == binding of bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus reuteri to the carbohydrate  moieties of intestinal glycolipids recognized by peanut agglutinin.
AB  == we examined binding of bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus reuteri to the carbohydrate moieties of glycolipids extracted from human enterocyte-like caco-2  cells in this study. in binding assays to reference glycolipids of different carbohydrate compositions, b. bifidum eb102 bound strongly to gangliotetraosylceramide (asialo-gm1) and less strongly to gangliotriaosylceramide (asialo-gm2), lactosylceramide and sulfatide. the binding profile of b. bifidum eb102 was almost identical to that of l. reuteri jcm1081 described previously [lett. appl. microbiol. 27 (1998) 130]. when we examined binding to neutral glycolipids extracted from caco-2 cells, the binding profiles  of b. bifidum eb102 and l. reuteri jcm1081 were very similar to that shown by peanut agglutinin (pna). binding of both strains to periodate-treated intestinal  glycolipids was completely abolished, suggesting that the bacterial cells bind to carbohydrate moieties of the glycolipids. furthermore, b. bifidum eb102 was found to express multiple glycolipid-binding proteinaceaous components on the cell surface. these results strongly suggested involvement of cell-surface proteinaceous components of b. bifidum in binding to the carbohydrate moieties of intestinal glycolipids recognized by pna. binding ability of b. bifidum and l. reuteri to intestinal glycolipids may play a crucial role for colonization on the mucosal surface of the intestine.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.
