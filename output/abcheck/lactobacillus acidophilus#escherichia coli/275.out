deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26  are colinear products of a single gene.
three of the four deoxynucleoside kinases required for growth of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26 exist as heterodimeric pairs specific for deoxyadenosine (dak) and deoxycytidine (dck) or dak and deoxyguanosine (dgk).
however, only two tandem genes, dak/dgk, are found, and are expressed only as dak/dgk in transformed escherichia coli.
sequencing peptides spanning 63% of the native dck subunit revealed a sequence identical to that deduced from dgk (beginning mtvivl...), except that dck lacks residues 2 and 3 (dck is m..ivl; dgk is .tvivl).
also, mass spectrometry indicates that native dck and dgk subunits are identical in mass adjusted for the first three residues.
furthermore, the native enzymes have identical isoelectric ph values, indicating an equal number of charged residues. to enable e. coli to express peptide having the native dck sequence, codons 2 and 3 were deleted from the dgk portion of the tandem genes, resulting in expression of protein having the specificities and regulatory properties of native dak/dck, including heterotropic stimulation of dak activity by deoxycytidine or dctp (not deoxyguanosine or dgtp) and end-product inhibition of the respective activities by datp and dctp.
subcloning normal and mutant dgk yielded homodimeric dgk and dck, respectively.
the dck homodimer strongly resembles human dck, with a low k(m) for deoxycytidine, the ability to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at much higher k(m) values, and end-product inhibition by dctp.
thus two distinct and specific enzymes evidently are derived from a single lactobacillus gene.
the mechanism by which this occurs in vivo has yet to be elucidated.
