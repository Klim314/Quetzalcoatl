TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == plasmid mediated antibiotic resistance in marine bacteria.
AB  == this research work was conducted in uppanar estuary to ascertain the role of plasmids in the antibiotic resistance of bacteria. water and sediment samples were collected for a period of three months. when tested against 20 antibiotics 22 mar strains were isolated from the samples, which were found resistant to 5-13 antibiotics. they belong to 7 genera and 10 species. gram-negative bacteria namely neisseria mucosa, n. sicca, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella ozaenae, citrobacterintermedius, pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes were isolated. gram-positive bacteria were of bacillus subtilis, b. megaterium and micrococcus luteus. when plasmid curing was done using acredine orange, the resistance against penicillin-g, ampicillin, tetracycline, amoxycillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were totally lost in all strains, which confirmed  the role of plasmid in these strains against antibiotics. ten strains belong to different species were selected for the plasmid isolation and electrophoresis was done. presence of plasmids in all strains was confirmed and the molecular weight  was in the range of 2850 to 3170 bp. the study revealed that mar strains are common in uppanar estuary and they are plasmid mediated. this environment is seemed to be deteriorating at an alarming rate.

TI  == [antihistone activity of bacteria].
AB  == for the first time an anti-histone activity of bacteria has been revealed and a method of its determination has been suggested. bacteria used in the study and isolated from anterior section of nasal mucosa of the children have been identified on a species level and characterized in terms of their antihistone activity. with employment of light microscopic technique different stages of interaction between bacteria and nuclei of epitheliocytes of anterior section of  nasal mucous membrane of children under school age were studied. a biological significance of antihistone activity of bacteria as well as a possibility of its  use in biotechnology, medicine, ecology is discussed.
