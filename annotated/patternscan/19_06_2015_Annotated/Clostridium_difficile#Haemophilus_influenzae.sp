TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (zinforo, teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant gram-positive organisms, including mrsa, as well as for gram-negative respiratory pathogens. in pivotal phase iii studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csstis) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) [pneumonia outcomes research team (port) risk  class iii or iv]; however, patients with cap admitted to the intensive care unit  were not evaluated. ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with csstis (including those with suspected mrsa infection) or cap (port risk class iii or iv) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. as with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good  antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == current and future challenges in the development of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == micro-organisms exist to survive. even in the absence of antimicrobial agents, many have determinants of resistance that may be expressed phenotypically, should the need arise. with the advent of the antibiotic age, as more and more drugs were developed to treat serious infections, micro-organisms (particularly bacteria) rapidly developed resistance determinants to prevent their own demise.the most important determinants of resistance have been in the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) have taxed researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop new agents that are effective against these resistant strains. among the gram-negative bacteria, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) enzymes, carbapenemases (cres) and the so-called amp-c enzymes that may be readily transferred between species of enterobacteriaceae and other facultative species have created multi-drug resistant organisms that are difficult to treat. other resistance determinants have been seen in other clinically important bacterial species such as neisseria  gonorrhoeae, clostridium difficile, haemophilus influenzae and mycobacterium tuberculosis. these issues have now spread to fungal agents of infection.a variety of modalities have been used to stem the tide of resistance. these include the development of niche compounds that target specific resistance determinants. other approaches have been to find new targets for antimicrobial activity, use of combination agents that are effective against more than one target in the cell, or new delivery mechanism to maximize the concentration of antimicrobial agents at the site of infection without causing toxicity to the host. it is important that such new modalities have been proved effective for clinical therapy. animal models and non-mammalian systems have been developed to  determine if new agents will reach sufficient concentrations at infection sites to predict clinical efficacy without toxicity. it will also be key to consider antimicrobial stewardship as an important component of the continuing battle to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  == health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. secondary infections with streptococcus pneumoniae,  other streptococci (e.g. streptococcus pyogenes), haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. the uk department of health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. suggested severity criteria have not been validated  in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of  severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. these recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in uk hospitals. this article, written on behalf of the bsac council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == jun n-terminal protein kinase enhances middle ear mucosal proliferation during bacterial otitis media.
AB  == mucosal hyperplasia is a characteristic component of otitis media. the present study investigated the participation of signaling via the jun n-terminal protein  kinase (jnk) mitogen-activated protein kinase in middle ear mucosal hyperplasia in animal models of bacterial otitis media. otitis media was induced by the inoculation of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae into the middle ear cavity. western blotting revealed that phosphorylation of jnk isoforms in the middle ear  mucosa preceded but paralleled mucosal hyperplasia in this in vivo rat model. nuclear jnk phosphorylation was observed in many cells of both the mucosal epithelium and stroma by immunohistochemistry. in an in vitro model of primary rat middle ear mucosal explants, bacterially induced mucosal growth was blocked by the rac/cdc42 inhibitor clostridium difficile toxin b, the mixed-lineage kinase inhibitor cep11004, and the jnk inhibitor sp600125. finally, the jnk inhibitor sp600125 significantly inhibited mucosal hyperplasia during in vivo bacterial otitis media in guinea pigs. inhibition of jnk in vivo resulted in a diminished proliferative response, as shown by a local decrease in proliferating  cell nuclear antigen protein expression by immunohistochemistry. we conclude that activation of jnk is a critical pathway for bacterially induced mucosal hyperplasia during otitis media, influencing tissue proliferation.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

TI  == haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s  ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == in vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems j-111, 225, j-114,870, and j-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the c-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. among isolates of both methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), 90% were inhibited by j-111,347 (prototype), j-111,225, j-114,870, and j-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an mic(90) of 128 microgram/ml. although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had mic(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml  for mrsa and mrcons, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. the potent anti-mrsa activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of  mrsa. since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile, as well as mrsa, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. t-3811, a free base of t-3811me, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in particular, t-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. t-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). t-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with gyra and parc (grla) mutations. the  activity of t-3811 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. in common with other fluoroquinolones, t-3811 was highly active against haemophilus  influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and legionella sp., with mic90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. t-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. t-3811 was the most active agent against c. trachomatis (mic, 0.008 microgram/ml) and m. pneumoniae (mic90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). the activity of t-3811 against m. tuberculosis (mic90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. in experimental systemic infection with a grla mutant of s. aureus and experimental  pneumonia with prsp in mice, t-3811me showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.

TI  == successful control of clostridium difficile infection in an elderly care unit through use of a restrictive antibiotic policy.
AB  == toxin-producing clostridium difficile is the commonest bacterial cause of nosocomial diarrhoea and is a well recognized cause of hospital outbreaks in elderly care units. high c. difficile disease rates have been associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially cephalosporins. an outbreak of c. difficile infection in the elderly care unit at gloucestershire royal nhs trust continued despite increased ward cleaning and strict implementation of infection  control measures. a restrictive antibiotic policy that would maintain colonization resistance in the gastrointestinal tract was introduced throughout this unit. patients admitted with suspected infection were prescribed intravenous (i.v.) benzylpenicillin 1.2-1.8 g every 6 h to cover streptococcal infections and i.v. trimethoprim 200 mg twice daily to cover urinary tract pathogens and haemophilus influenzae. if the patient had septic shock a single iv dose of gentamicin was given (120-180 mg) to cover more resistant gram-negative bacilli.  the following were monitored before and after the policy change. the number of cases of c. difficile toxin-positive diarrhoea; cefuroxime and total antibiotic use on the elderly care wards; patient mortality rates; and length of hospital stay: two hundred and fifty-two and 234 patients respectively with a discharge diagnosis of infection were admitted before and after the antibiotic policy change. mortality rates and length of hospital stay were unchanged. cefuroxime prescribing and total antibiotic prescribing costs fell by 5150 pounds sterling and 8622 pounds sterling respectively in the 7 month period after the change. thirty-seven cases of c. difficile diarrhoea occurred in the period before and 16 in the period after the policy change. the incidence of c. difficile diarrhoea and of cefuroxime use has remained low since then. the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired infections in the elderly should be encouraged. outbreaks of c. difficile diarrhoea should be managed with the combined approach of infection control and strict antibiotic policies.

TI  == [infections in pediatrics].
AB  == probability-based antibiotic therapy: in children, the risk of an unfavorable course of bacterial infections requires careful selection of the initial antibiotic prescription based on the disease state, bacterial epidemiology and the child's age. acute community acquired pneumonia: before the age of 5 years, antibiotics active against haemophilus influenzae such as amoxicillin or clavulanic acid can be given orally. in children over 5, amoxicillin or a macrolide are effective. severe ear, nose and throat infections: for sore throats, clinical and bacterial results of a 4-day antibiotic regimen using a second generation cephalosporin are equivalent (with better compliance) to a 10-day regimen of penicillin v. for acute middle ear infections, a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is usually prescribed as initial treatment. community acquired bacterial meningitis: the most recent consensus established the indication for cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the increasing number of peni-r pneumococci and the major drop in the frequency of haemophilus infections have led to new therapeutic propositions currently under investigation. acute skin infections: for impetigo, general antibiotics-oxacillin or a derivative-are required due to the risk of contagion. bone and joint infections: for these urgent situations, in vitro sensitivity and antibiotic penetration into the infected tissue are the determining factors. bacterial diarrhea: antibiotics are  not required in case of acute diaarhea with little or no fever. antibiotics could be discussed for cholera-like diarrhea and are required in case of invasive bacterial diarrhea, shigelosis, cholera, and clostridium difficile as well as diarrhea with fever and blood loss in infants or salmonella-induced diarrhea with signs of extradigestive complications. urinary tract infections: the choice of the antibiotic and the duration of treatment depend on the clinical presentation: lower tract infection, acute pyeloephritis, or prophylaxis. the causal germ must  be identified for adapted antibiotic treatment.

AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial spectrum and activity of ceftibuten against clinical isolates from west germany.
AB  == the in vitro activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten, was determined against 837 clinical isolates by agar dilution technique and compared with that of the oral cephalosporins, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and cefprozil. against enterobacteriaceae, ceftibuten was the most active of the compounds. ceftibuten mic90s were less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml for most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 0.13 microgram/ml for haemophilus  influenzae, 4 micrograms/ml for moraxella catarrhalis, and 0.5 microgram/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae. ceftibuten also was active against beta-haemolytic streptococci (serogroups a, c, and g) and penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), but was not active against staphylococcus spp. or the anaerobic bacteria studied. cefpodoxime and cefuroxime were the most active of the cephalosporins against nonenteric streptococci; cefprozil and cefuroxime were the most active against staphylococci, and cefaclor demonstrated the greatest activity against some bacteroides spp. most strains of  acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas spp., and methicillin-resistant staphylococci, as well as all strains of clostridium difficile, were resistant to each of the cephalosporins tested.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterococcus sp, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides bivius, and clostridium difficile obtained  from laboratories at hospitals in st. louis, in memphis, and in newark, new jersey. of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime,  81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam,  and 51% to cefoxitin.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility testing of ofloxacin. current  status.
AB  == the fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum. based on our data and a review of the literature, ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. ninety-five percent of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (mic, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (mic, more than or  equal to 4 micrograms/ml). clostridium spp., including clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the mics by one doubling concentration. a modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: mics with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin mics have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm. quality control parameters also are summarized.

TI  == intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for  random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. the most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. the most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing p. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other  appropriate drugs. serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. we conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the enterobacteriaceae (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l). the activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. all of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against vibrio cholerae (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) aeromonas hydrophila (mic less than or equal to 0.03  mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, bordetella pertussis and legionella pneumophila (mic less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic streptococcus spp. (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l), corynebacterium diphtheriae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and cory. jeikeium (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococcus spp., str. pneumoniae and listeria monocytogenes (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and str. faecalis (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). the activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. clostridium perfringens (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and cl. difficile (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more  resistant. ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against chlamydia trachomatis sa2f (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the in-vitro activity of pd127,391, a new quinolone.
AB  == mics of pd127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of ci934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. pd127,391 was the most active drug against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp (mics less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against aeromonas spp. (mics less than 0.008 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics less than 1 mg/l). it was more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. including ps. maltophilia (mics less than  0.25 mg/l). all three drugs had high activity, with pd129,391 again the best, against haemophilus influenzae brahmamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. pd127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against campylobacter coli/jejuni (pd127,391 mics less than 0.03 mg/l) and gardnerella vaginalis (pd127,391 mics less than 0.25 mg/l). pd127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than ci934 or ciprofloxacin. pd127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including clostridium difficile) (mics less than 1 mg/l) than was ci934 (mics less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (mics less than 64 mg/l). no bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of pd127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of trospectomycin (u-63366f), a novel spectinomycin analog.
AB  == trospectomycin (u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin analog with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of this analog was compared with that of spectinomycin and other reference antibiotics against 411 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. mics were determined by agar or broth dilution methods. the stability of trospectomycin in the presence of an enzyme extract derived from spectinomycin-resistant escherichia coli was determined. trospectomycin was more active than spectinomycin (4- to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus species, bacteroides species, clostridium difficile, clostridium species, and chlamydia trachomatis. trospectomycin demonstrated a moderate level of activity (comparable to that of spectinomycin) for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae tested and was generally cross resistant with spectinomycin. trospectomycin was susceptible to inactivation by crude enzyme preparations from spectinomycin-inactivating strains of e. coli. trospectomycin inhibited a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease. clinical studies with this novel aminocyclitol antibiotic are in progress.
