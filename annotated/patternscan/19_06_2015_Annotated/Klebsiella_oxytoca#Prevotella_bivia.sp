TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.
