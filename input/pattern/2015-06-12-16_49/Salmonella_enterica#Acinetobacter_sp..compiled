TI  - Effects on Salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating  hens' eggs with chitosan.
AB  - Chitosan is a biopolymer with antimicrobial activity and film-forming properties. In this study, the effects on Salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating hens' eggs with chitosan was evaluated. A chitosan was selected from eight types (four non-commercial and four commercial) based on its antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). For this purpose, a contact plate method was developed and chitosans were applied at a concentration of 0.25% (w/v). A commercial type with a molecular weight of 310-375 kDa and a deacetylation degree of 75% that reduced S. Enteritidis by 0.71 log(10) colony forming units compared to the control (without chitosan) was selected for further studies. The chitosan was shown to have antimicrobial activity against other egg borne bacteria, i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii, Alcaligenes sp., Carnobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus warneri, and against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. The effects of various concentrations of the selected chitosan (0.25%, 1% and 2%) on Salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration were assessed using the agar molding technique. Effective reduction of eggshell contamination could not be demonstrated, but trans-shell penetration was significantly reduced in the presence of a 2% chitosan eggshell coating, with only 6.1% of the eggs being penetrated compared to 24.5% of the uncoated eggs. It was concluded that the 2% chitosan coating has the potential to reduce contamination of egg contents resulting from trans-shell penetration by S. Enteritidis.
TI  - Eggshell factors influencing eggshell penetration and whole egg contamination by  different bacteria, including Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - Trans-shell infection routes and whole egg contamination of 7 selected bacterial  strains; Staphylococcus warneri, Acinetobacter baumannii, Alcaligenes sp., Serratia marcescens, Carnobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Salmonella enteritidis, recovered from egg contents, were studied. The first objective was to correlate bacterial eggshell penetration with various eggshell characteristics and bacterial strains. An agar approach was used to assess the eggshell penetration. The second objective was to assess the contamination of whole eggs with the bacterial strains; whole intact eggs were used in this case. The intact shells of agar-filled and whole eggs were inoculated with 10(3) -10(4) cfu of the selected strains. During 3 weeks storage at 20 degrees C and 60% relative humidity, the bacterial eggshell penetration was regularly monitored. The whole egg contamination was only analyzed after 3 weeks. The eggshell characteristics such as area eggshell, shell thickness and number of pores did not influence the bacterial eggshell penetration. For each individual bacterial strain the mean cuticle deposition was lower for penetrated compared to non-penetrated eggshells. For the individual strain Carnobacterium sp. and for the global results of all strains this difference was statistical significantly. The whole egg contamination was not influenced by neither the area of the eggshell nor the porosity of the eggshell. The results of the agar approach indicate that the Gram-negative, motile and non-clustering bacteria penetrated the eggshell most frequently; Pseudomonas sp. (60%) and Alcaligenes sp. (58%) were primary invaders followed by S. enteritidis (43%). All selected strains were able to penetrate; penetration was observed most frequently after ca. 4-5 days. Particularly S. enteritidis was a primary invader of whole eggs: the membranes and/or the content of 32% of the whole eggs was contaminated. The remaining bacterial eggshell contamination with the selected strain was determined after 3 weeks storage. Penetrated eggshells and contaminated whole eggs showed a significantly higher bacterial contamination on the eggshell compared to non-penetrated eggshells and non-contaminated whole eggs respectively (global results of all strains). The influence of hen age on bacterial eggshell penetration and egg content contamination was not significant. While the agar approach is suitable to study the influence of the eggshell characteristics on the bacterial eggshell penetration, the intact egg approach gives an estimation of the penetration of the shell followed by the probability of survival and migration in whole eggs.
TI  - Bacteriophages and insertion sequences of Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472.
AB  - A fluid genome is a great advantage to prokaryotes, enabling quick adaptation to  various types of ecological niches and to diverse environmental selective pressures. A substantial portion of these sudden changes is mediated by lateral gene transfer (LGT), through genetic recombination mechanisms, such as transformation, conjugation and transduction. The recent sequencing of several organisms has offered a new approach to the study of LGT, using comparison and analysis of nucleotide sequences dispersed throughout the genome of these species. This analysis in Choromobacterium violaceum has revealed four prophage and 12 insertion sequences, suggesting genetic exchange with several other bacterial species, including Salmonella enterica, Ralstonia and Xanthomonas. An Rhs (recombination hot spot) element (containing a vgr-like gene) was also observed, the function of which remains unknown, but it has a sequence related to species of Acinetobacter and Sphingomonas. These results support the role of LGT in the acquisition of new traits by C. violaceum.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) composition in recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  - A recombinant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (mutant in propionate-activation activity) was metabolically engineered to control the composition of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy- valerate) (PHBV), a polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer with commercially desirable properties. A gene (prpE) encoding propionyl-CoA synthetase was placed under the control of the IPTG-inducible taclacUV5 promoter (P(taclacUV5)) while the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis operon (phaBCA) from Acinetobacter sp. RA3849 was coexpressed under the control of the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter (P(BAD)). S. enterica, harboring both constructs, was grown in medium containing a fixed substrate concentration and the composition of the copolymer was varied between 2 mol% and 25 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate by controlling the IPTG level in the medium. This "dial-a-composition" system should find application in cases where the substrate concentration of a feedstream for PHBV bioplastic production is not adjustable.
TI  - Identification and sequence analysis of a 27-kilobase chromosomal fragment containing a Salmonella pathogenicity island located at 92 minutes on the chromosome map of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium LT2.
AB  - Using a genomic approach, we have identified a new Salmonella pathogenicity island, SPI-4, which is the fourth Salmonella pathogenicity island to be identified. SPI-4 was located at 92 min on the chromosome map and was flanked by the ssb and soxSR loci. The DNA sequence covering the entire SPI-4 and both boundaries was determined. The size of SPI-4 was about 25 kb and it contains 18 putative open reading frames (ORFs). Three of these ORFs encode proteins that have significant homology with proteins involved in toxin secretion. Another five ORFs encode proteins that have significant homology with hypothetical proteins from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The rest of the ORFs encode novel proteins, one of which has five membrane-spanning domains. SPI-4 is likely to carry a type I secretion system involved in toxin secretion. Furthermore, a previously identified locus (ims98), which is required for intramacrophage survival, was also mapped within the SPI-4 region. These findings suggested that SPI-4 is needed for intramacrophage survival.
