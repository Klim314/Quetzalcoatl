TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not coxsackievirus b4e2.
AB  == this study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 (l. gasseri cmul57), l. acidophilus cmul67 and l. plantarum cmul140 against herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2) and coxsackievirus b4e2 (cvb4e2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. these lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic  and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by hsv-2 in vero cell monolayers. however, lactobacilli were not active against cvb4e2. tested lactobacilli displayed anti-hsv-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to vero cell monolayers. the detection of  hsv-2 dna by pcr in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-hsv-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. this study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as hsv-2.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. we employed 4 different lactobacillus species,  namely l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. reuteri, and 2 c. albicans strains, the reference day286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the fjs24 strain. as assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (cfsf) affected candida,  impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. the cfsf-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the c. albicans hwp1 genotype.

TI  == pre-treatment with probiotics prolongs survival after experimental infection by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in rodents: an effect on sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
AB  == based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr)  pseudomonas aeruginosa. experiments using an escherichia coli strain susceptible  to all antimicrobials were also conducted. c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or lactobacillus plantarum. survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and bifidobacterium lactis; lactolevure((r))). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed p. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. pre-treatment with l. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either mdr p. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%;  p=0.026) or e. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.003). survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with lactolevure((r)). tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. tnfalpha and il-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and ifngamma production was decreased. pre-treatment with lactolevure((r)) restored production of il-17. stimulation of human pbmcs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of socs3. the  results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

TI  == probiotic bacteria lactobacillus and bifidobacterium attenuate inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis in mice.
AB  == it is widely accepted that inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) arises from a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the enteric microbiota in the gut of a genetically susceptible individual. no definitive therapies are available for this inflammatory disorder. therefore it became imperative to develop new strategies for treating this disease. probiotics have emerged as a potential new  therapeutic strategy for ibd, however their exact mechanisms of action is still poorly defined. in this study, we address the potential effect of a probiotic cocktail (ultrabiotique(r)) composed of four live bacterial strains (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, b. lactis and b.breve) to promote recovery from acute  colitis. probiotic was given to mice by oral gavage after the onset of colitis and the establishment of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced intestinal injury.  clinical parameters were monitored daily, histological scores of colitis and the  production of nitric oxide (no) and interferon-&#947; (ifn-&#947;) were determined. in addition, tlr4, nf-&#954;b and inos colonic expression were examined. probiotic treatment ameliorated clinical symptoms and histological scores. no and ifn-&#947; production in plasma were decreased by probiotic. these results were associated with reduced tlr4, inos and nf-&#1082;b expression in colonic tissue. in conclusion, probiotic exerted anti-inflammatory effects and contributed to a rapid recovery of dss-induced acute colitis.

TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == therapeutic enhancement of newly derived bacteriocins against giardia lamblia.
AB  == trials for identifying efficient anti-giardial agents are still ongoing. nowadays, bacteriocins have attracted the attention as potential antimicrobial compounds. for the first time, the current study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of bacteriocins derived from newly isolated egyptian strains of probiotics lactobacilli; l. acidophilus (p106) and l. plantarum (p164) against giardia lamblia. bacteriocins' efficacy was evaluated both in vitro; by growth inhibition and adherence assays, and in vivo; through estimation of parasite density, intestinal histopathological examination and ultrastructural analysis of giardia trophozoites. in vivo bacteriocins' clinical safety was assessed. in vitro results proved that 50 microg of l. acidophilus bacteriocin induced reduction of the mean giardia lamblia trophozoites by 58.3 +/- 4.04%, while at lower concentrations of 10 and 20 microg of both l. acidophilus and l. plantarum, non significant reduction of the mean parasite density was achieved. in vitro trophozoites adherence was susceptible to the tested bacteriocins at all studied  concentrations with variable degrees, while the highest adherence reduction was demonstrated using 50 microg of l acidophilus bacteriocin. in vivo, oral inoculation of 50 microg/mouse l. acidophilus bacteriocin for 5 successive days resulted in a noteworthy decline of the intestinal parasite density, along with amelioration of intestinal pathology of infected mice. ultrastructural examination proved thatfive doses of l. acidophilus bacteriocin showed marked changes in cellular architecture of the trophozoites with evident disorganization of the cell membrane, adhesive disc and cytoplasmic components. this is the first reported study of the safe anti-giardial efficacy of l. acidophilus (p106) derived bacteriocin, hence highlighting its great promise as a potential therapeutic safe alternative to existing commercial drugs.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == eruca sativa might influence the growth, survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and some biological features of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains.
AB  == the growth and viability of three lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, after their passage through simulated gastric and pancreatic juices were studied as a function of their presence in the growth medium of rocket salad (eruca sativa). the presence of e. sativa affected some of the biological properties of the strains. for example, l. acidophilus and l. plantarum worked more efficiently in  the presence of e. sativa, increasing not only the antioxidant activity of the medium, but also their own antioxidant power and antimicrobial activity; l. rhamnosus was not affected in the same manner. overall, the presence of vegetables might help to boost, in specific cases, some of the characteristics of lactobacilli, including antioxidant and antimicrobial power.

TI  == naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria isolated from tomato pomace silage.
AB  == silage making has become a significant method of forage conservation worldwide. to determine how tomato pomace (tp) may be used effectively as animal feed, it was ensilaged for 90 days and microbiology counts, fermentation characteristics and chemical composition of tomato pomace silage (tps) were evaluated at the 30th, 60th, and 90th days, respectively. in addition, 103 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from tps. based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s rdna sequence and carbohydrate fermentation tests, the isolates were identified as 17 species namely: lactobacillus coryniformis subsp.  torquens (0.97%), lactobacillus pontis (0.97%), lactobacillus hilgardii (0.97%),  lactobacillus pantheris (0.97%), lactobacillus amylovorus (1.9%), lactobacillus panis (1.9%), lactobacillus vaginalis (1.9%), lactobacillus rapi (1.9%), lactobacillus buchneri (2.9%), lactobacillus parafarraginis (2.9%), lactobacillus helveticus (3.9%), lactobacillus camelliae (3.9%), lactobacillus fermentum (5.8%), lactobacillus manihotivorans (6.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (10.7%), lactobacillus harbinensis (16.5%) and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (35.0%). this study has shown that tp can be well preserved for 90 days by ensilaging and that tps is not only rich in essential nutrients, but that physiological and biochemical properties of the isolates could provide a platform for future design of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants aimed at improving the fermentation quality of silage.

TI  == determination of expression and activity of genes involved in starch metabolism in lactobacillus plantarum a6 during fermentation of a cereal-based gruel.
AB  == traditional fermented gruels prepared from cereals are widely used for complementary feeding of young children in africa and usually have a low energy density. the amylase activity of some lactic acid bacteria (lab) helps increase the energy content of gruels through partial hydrolysis of starch, thus enabling  the incorporation of more starchy material while conserving the desired semi-liquid consistency for young children. even if this ability is mainly related to the production of alpha-amylase (e.c. 3.2.1.1), in a recent molecular  screening, genes coding for enzymes involved in starch metabolism were detected in the efficient amylolytic lab lactobacillus plantarum a6: alpha-glucosidase (e.c. 3.2.1.20), neopullulanase (e.c. 3.2.1.135), amylopectin phosphorylase (e.c. 2.4.1.1) and maltose phosphorylase (e.c. 2.4.1.8). the objective of this study was to investigate the expression of these genes in a model of starchy fermented  food made from pearl millet (pennisetum glaucum). transcriptional and enzymatic analyses were performed during the 18-h fermentation period. liquefaction was mainly caused by an extracellular alpha amylase encoded by the amya gene specific to the a6 strain among l. plantarum species and found in both lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus manihotivorans. the second most active enzyme was neopullulanase. other starch metabolizing enzymes were less often detected. the dynamic detection of transcripts of gene during starch fermentation in pearl millet porridge suggests that the set of genes we investigated was not expressed  continuously but transiently.

TI  == in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of selected oxalate-degrading probiotic bacteria: potential applications in the prevention and treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  == oxalate (ox) is a very common component of the human diet, capable to collect in  the renal tissue and bind calcium to form calcium oxalate (caox) crystals. a supersaturation of caox crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. the inflammation derived from the caox crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. in this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative  approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of rp-hplc-uv method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. four promising bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus acidophilus la-14, bifidobacterium breve pbs077, bifidobacterium longum pbs078) were identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention  and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the ox accumulation. practical application: the oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic  approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state.

AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific pcr and maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to compare maldi-tof results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific pcr. methods: the 87 isolates were analyzed by maldi-tof ms (microflex lt, maldi biotyper 3.0, bruker daltonik, bremen, germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. for the identification with species-specific pcr, oligonucleotide primers (16s rrna) specific for l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri, l. plantarum, and  l. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. the pcr-products were  separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. results: for 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as l. rhamnosus, 16 as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as l. paracasei, 3 as l. gasseri, 2 as l. plantarum, and 1 as l. casei. in 4.5% of the  cases the results were discordant. of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific pcr, 1 strain was identified by maldi-tof ms as l. spec. and 1 as l. parabuchneri. one strain could not be identified by either method. conclusions: both methods are highly sensitive. limitations can be the precision  of the primers (pcr) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.

TI  == probiotic therapy: a promising strategy for the control of canine hookworm.
AB  == canis familiaris is a domestic animal which plays an important role as a pet; however, it is very likely to develop diseases characterized by high morbidity and mortality. in this sense, there are some ancylostomatidae species that can lead to anemia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. therefore, the treatment with allopathic drugs is essential for eliminating the parasitism. however, the increasing occurrence of resistance to allopathic treatments stimulates the search for new therapeutic inputs, among which the probiotics stand out and are able to positively alter the intestinal microbiota and exert immunomodulatory effect. therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of using species of lactobacillus (l. acidophilus atcc 4536, l. plantarum atcc 8014, and l. delbrueckii ufv h2b20) to control canine ancylostomiasis. a probiotic preparation containing 1 x 10(6) cfu of each strain was administered to 10 naturally infected animals, on alternate days for 28 days. it was observed that the treatment with the probiotic preparation led to a significant reduction in epg of feces (88.83%/ p < 0.05), as well as an increase in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, highlighting the potential use of lactobacillus species in the control of canine ancylostomiasis.

TI  == [identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  == objective: to identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. methods: labs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16s rrna sequence. genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr). the sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all lab isolates by kirby-bauer paper diffusion (k-b method). meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (args), including erythromycin resistance genes (erma and ermb) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetm, tetk, tets, tetq, teto, tetl and tetw), were detected by pcr amplification in the identified lab isolates. the pcr products were confirmed by sequencing. results: total 100 labs were isolated, including 23 lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 lactobacillus casei, 30 streptococcus thermophilus, 5 lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 lactobacillus paracasei. the drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates  were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. moreover, 5 args were  found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermb gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet k in 4 isolates, tetl in 2 isolates, tetm in 4 isolates, teto in 2  isolates. erm a, tet s, tet q and tet w genes were not detected in the isolates.  antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. conclusions: some labs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus. all the lab isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. we proved again that lab could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from tibetan kefir grains.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the functional properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from tibetan kefir grains. three lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus acidophilus la15, lactobacillus plantarum b23 and lactobacillus kefiri d17 that showed resistance to acid and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. the 3 selected strains expressed high in vitro adherence to caco-2 cells. they were sensitive to gentamicin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol and resistant to vancomycin with mic values of 26 microg/ml. all 3 strains showed potential bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activity, cholesterol assimilation and cholesterol co-precipitation ability. additionally, the potential effect of these strains on  plasma cholesterol levels was evaluated in sprague-dawley (sd) rats. rats in 4 treatment groups were fed the following experimental diets for 4 weeks: a high-cholesterol diet, a high-cholesterol diet plus la15, a high-cholesterol diet plus b23 or a high-cholesterol diet plus d17. the total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the serum were significantly (p<0.05) decreased in the lab-treated rats compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet without lab supplementation. the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in groups b23 and d17 were significantly (p<0.05) higher than  those in the control and la15 groups. additionally, both fecal cholesterol and bile acid levels were significantly (p<0.05) increased after lab administration.  fecal lactobacilli counts were significantly (p<0.05) higher in the lab treatment groups than in the control groups. furthermore, the 3 strains were detected in the rat small intestine, colon and feces during the feeding trial. the bacteria levels remained high even after the lab administration had been stopped for 2 weeks. these results suggest that these strains may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == effect of aloe vera juice on growth and activities of lactobacilli in-vitro.
AB  == in present investigation, different concentrations of aloe vera juice incorporated into the growth media of lactobacilli were tested to observe the effect on growth and activities of these bacteria. from the results obtained, it  was observed that aloe vera juice at a concentration of 5% v/v was effective in promoting the growth of l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. casei, as evident from the fall in ph and increased acidity, as well as from the improved generation time. at 15 to 25% concentration, growth was unaffected as compared to the controls; however, concentration higher than 25%v/v discouraged the growth. overall, it was concluded that aloe vera juice or gel at a particular concentration could possibly be used in combination with probiotic lactobacillus  strain(s) as a combinational therapy for gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == synergistic protection of combined probiotic conditioned media against neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis-like intestinal injury.
AB  == balance among the complex interactions of the gut microbial community is important for intestinal health. probiotic bacteria can improve bacterial balance and have been used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is a life-threatening inflammatory bowel disorder primarily affecting premature infants. nec is associated with extensive inflammatory nf-kappab signaling activation as well as intestinal barrier disruption. clinical studies have shown that probiotic administration may protect against nec, however there are safety concerns associated with the ingestion of large bacterial loads  in preterm infants. bacteria-free conditioned media (cm) from certain probiotic organisms have been shown to retain bioactivity including anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties without the risks of live organisms. we hypothesized that the cm from lactobacillus acidophilus (la), bifidobacterium infantis (bi), and lactobacillus plantarum (lp), used separately or together would protect against nec. a rodent model with intestinal injury similar to nec was used to study the effect of cm from lp, la/bi, and la/bi/lp on the pathophysiology of nec. all the cm suppressed nf-kappab activation via preserved ikappabalpha expression and this protected ikappabalpha was associated with decreased liver activity of the proteasome, which is the degrading machinery for ikappabalpha. these cm effects also caused decreases in intestinal production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha, a downstream target of the nf-kappab pathway. combined la/bi and la/bi/lp cm in addition protected intestinal barrier  function by maintaining tight junction protein zo-1 levels and localization at the tight junction. double combined la/bi cm significantly reduced intestinal injury incidence from 43% to 28% and triple combined la/bi/lp cm further reduced  intestinal injury incidence to 20%. thus, this study demonstrates different protective mechanisms and synergistic bioactivity of the cm from different organisms in ameliorating nec-like intestinal injury in an animal model.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == beneficial role of the probiotic mixture ultrabiotique on maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier in dss-induced experimental colitis.
AB  == the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn disease has not yet been clarified. several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. increased production of nitric oxide  (no) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during uc and experimental colitis. our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during dss-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. for that purpose, the  probiotic formulation ultrabiotique((r)) (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during dss induced colitis. ultrabiotique((r)) treatment down regulated the no production by peritoneal macrophages of dss-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both  dss-treated and healthy mice. in conclusion, the modification of microflora by the ultrabiotique((r)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.

TI  == metabolism of biodiesel-derived glycerol in probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == three probiotic lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus delbrueckii, were tested for their ability to assimilate and metabolize glycerol. biodiesel-derived glycerol was used as the main carbon and energy source in batch microaerobic growth. here, we show that the tested strains were able to assimilate glycerol, consuming between 38 and 48  % in approximately 24 h. l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii showed a similar growth, higher than l. plantarum. the highest biomass reached was 2.11 g l(-)(1)  for l. acidophilus, with a cell mass yield (y (x/s)) of 0.37 g g(-)(1). l. delbrueckii and l. plantarum reached a biomass of 2.06 and 1.36 g l(-)(1). all strains catabolize glycerol mainly through glycerol kinase (ec 2.7.1.30). for these lactobacillus species, kinetic parameters for glycerol kinase showed michaelis-menten constant (k(m)) ranging from 1.2 to 3.8 mm. the specific activities for glycerol kinase in these strains were in the range of 0.18 to 0.58 u mg protein(-)(1), with l. acidophilus atcc 4356 showing the maximum specific activity after 24 h of cultivation. glycerol dehydrogenase activity was also detected in all strains studied but only for the reduction of glyceraldehyde with nadph (k(m) for dl-glyceraldehyde ranging from 12.8 to 32.3 mm). this enzyme shows a very low oxidative activity with glycerol and nadp+ and, most likely, under physiological conditions, the oxidative reaction does not occur, supporting the assumption that the main metabolic flux concerning glycerol metabolism is through the glycerol kinase pathway.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic strains for development of fermented alisma canaliculatum and their effects on broiler chickens.
AB  == the present study was conducted to select appropriate microbial strains for the development of fermented alisma canaliculatum a. br. et bouche (fac) feed additive and to examine their effects on broilers. in experiment 1, 16 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus coagulans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae from the korean collection for type cultures (kctc) were evaluated. the strains were tested for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance levels. among them, l. acidophilus kctc 3111, e. faecium kctc 2022, b. subtilis kctc 3239, and s. cerevisiae kctc 7928 were selected to produce fac. for experiment 2, 140 ross broiler chicks were allocated to four 5-wk-long dietary groups: nc (basal diet),  pc (basal diet with 0.005% oxytetracycline), ac (basal diet with 0.5% a. canaliculatum rhizome powder), and fac (basal diet with 0.5% fac). final bw and total bw gain were increased (p < 0.05) upon the addition of fac, whereas feed conversion ratio improved (p < 0.05) in the supplemented groups compared with the nc group. crude protein content increased and crude fat decreased (p < 0.05) in the breast meat of the fac group compared with the ac and pc groups, respectively. proventriculus and kidney relative weights of the fac group differed (p < 0.05) from the ac group but not from the pc group. lower (p < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value of thigh meat was observed in the fac group compared with the other groups. the fac diet increased (p < 0.05) alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in meat. alteration of these fatty acids led to increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid /saturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, and decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in breast or thigh meat (p < 0.05). it is concluded that fac confers high tolerance  to acid, bile and heat; and beneficially affects growth, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition. the fac may be a functional feed additive in broilers.

TI  == bugs that debugs: probiotics.
AB  == the oral cavity harbors a diverse array of bacterial species. there are more than 600 species that colonize in the oral cavity. these include a lot of organisms that are not commonly known to reside in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract and also are more familiar: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus  fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the balance of all these microorganisms can easily be disturbed and a prevalence of pathogenic organisms can lead to various oral health problems including dental caries, periodontitis, and halitosis.

TI  == myosin-cross-reactive antigens from four different lactic acid bacteria are fatty acid hydratases.
AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

TI  == effect of flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli to intestinal cells.
AB  == the effect of dietary flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells was unraveled. the inhibitory activity of these compounds on intestinal cells was highlighted. the cytotoxic effect was  shown to depend on both the compound's chemical structure (galloylation and polymerization) and degree of differentiation of intestinal cells. the effect of  flavan-3-ols on bacteria adhesion differed greatly between compounds, strains, and intestinal cells. all flavan-3-ols inhibited significantly lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and lactobacillus plantarum ifpl379 adhesion except epigallocatechin gallate, which enhanced l. acidophilus la-5 adhesion to caco-2.  procyanidins b1 and b2 increased remarkably the adhesion of lactobacillus casei lc115 to ht-29 cells, whereas epigallocatechin increased l. casei lc115 adhesion  to caco-2. these data showed the potential of flavan-3-ols to alter gut microecology by modifying adhesion of lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells.

TI  == comparative meta-analysis of the effect of lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  == background: obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. in order to clarify the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics (lcp) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. we intended to assess effects by lactobacillus species. methods: a broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. we included randomized controlled  trials (rcts) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. we primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. data were extracted independently by two authors. results were pooled by host and by lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (smds). results: we identified and included 17 rcts in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (smd 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). results were consistent in humans and animals. lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight  loss both in obese humans and in animals. conclusions: different lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. further studies are needed to clarify the role of lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == a meta-analysis of probiotic efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  == background: meta-analyses on the effects of probiotics on specific gastrointestinal diseases have generally shown positive effects on disease prevention and treatment; however, the relative efficacy of probiotic use for treatment and prevention across different gastrointestinal diseases, with differing etiology and mechanisms of action, has not been addressed. methods/principal findings: we included randomized controlled trials in humans that used a specified probiotic in the treatment or prevention of pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile disease, antibiotic associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, or necrotizing enterocolitis. random effects models were used to evaluate efficacy as pooled relative risks across the eight diseases as well as across probiotic species, single vs. multiple species, patient ages, dosages, and length of treatment. probiotics had a positive significant effect across all eight gastrointestinal diseases with a relative risk of 0.58 (95% (ci) 0.51-0.65). six  of the eight diseases: pouchitis, infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome,  helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile disease, and antibiotic associated diarrhea, showed positive significant effects. traveler's diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis did not show significant effects of probiotcs. of the 11 species and species mixtures, all showed positive significant effects except for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bifidobacterium infantis. across all diseases and probiotic species, positive significant effects of probiotics were observed for all age groups, single vs. multiple species, and  treatment lengths. conclusions/significance: probiotics are generally beneficial  in treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. efficacy was not observed for traveler's diarrhea or necrotizing enterocolitis or for the probiotic species l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, and b. infantis. when choosing to use probiotics in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disease, the type of disease and probiotic species (strain) are the most important factors to  take into consideration.

TI  == probiotic suppression of the h. pylori-induced responses by conjugated linoleic acids in a gastric epithelial cell line.
AB  == conjugated linoleic acids (cla) produced by lactobacillus acidophilus was reported to decrease the activation of nuclear factor-kappa b. cla was suggested  as one of the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanisms of probiotics. in the present study, the effects of cla on h. pylori-induced multiple responses were evaluated. il-8, tnf-alpha and inos were measured in mrna and/or protein levels in ags cells after pretreatment with cla or cla-containing conditioned medium (cm) produced by lactobacillus acidophilus or lactobacillus plantarum. the increased expressions of il-8 mrna/protein and tnf-alpha mrna were significantly  suppressed by pretreatment with cm or cla. the levels of il-8 protein and tnf-alpha mrna were suppressed by cm pretreatment better than cla. the expression of inos mrna was also significantly inhibited by cm pretreatment. these results suggest that the suppression of multiple mediators by cla-containing cm plays a key role in the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects of probiotics on  h. pylori infection.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  == probiotic cultures of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with nacl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. in some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was  applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (bgp) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. for most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of bgp supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. addition of the bgp supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium  did not enhance survival to air-drying. furthermore, addition of bgp to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. this study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use  air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == production of potentially probiotic beverages using single and mixed cereal substrates fermented with lactic acid bacteria cultures.
AB  == in the present work, single and mixed cereal substrates were fermented with lactic acid bacteria to study and compare the effect of the media formulation on  fermentation parameters. three cereal flours namely malt, barley and barley mixed with malt (barley-malt) were selected and fermented with two probiotic strains: lactobacillus plantarum (ncimb 8826) and lactobacillus acidophilus (ncimb 8821).  the effect of the single and mixed cereal flour suspensions on the fermentation of these two strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied at an incubation temperature of 30 degrees c for 28 h. it was found that the lab growth was enhanced in media containing malt and significant amounts of lactic acid were produced (0.5-3.5 g/l). a cell concentration between 7.9 and 8.5 log(1)(0) cfu/ml and a ph below 4.0 was achieved within 6 h of fermentation. though the cell populations in the mixed culture fermentations of mixed substrates were similar to the ones obtained with single cereal flours, significant differences in the production of lactic acid were observed. these results suggest that the functional and organoleptic properties of these cereal-based probiotic drinks could be considerably modified through changes in the substrate or inocula composition.

AB  == the potential of water extracts of the amazon medicinal plant chancapiedra (phyllanthus niruri l.) from ecuador and peru for antimicrobial activity against  helicobacter pylori and different strains of lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. h. pylori was inhibited by both water extracts in a dose dependent  manner, whereas lactic acid bacterial growth was not affected. both extracts contained ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and exhibited high free radical scavenging linked-antioxidant activities (89%). however, gallic acid was detected only in the ecuadorian extract. preliminary studies on the mode of action of chancapiedra against h. pylori revealed that inhibition may not involve proline dehydrogenase-based oxidative phosphorylation inhibition associated with  simple mono-phenolics and could involve ellagitannins or other non-phenolic compounds through a yet unknown mechanism. this study provides evidence about the potential of chancapiedra for h. pylori inhibition without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  == the health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (dc). most lactobacilli strains, including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong il-12 and tnf-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. in contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low il-12 and tnf-alpha inducers. il-10 and il-6 levels showed less  variation and no correlation with il-12 and tnf-alpha. dc matured by strong il-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (ifn)-beta. when combining two strains, low il-12 inducers inhibited this ifn-beta production as well as il-12 and th1-skewing chemokines. the ifn-beta induction was mediated through c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) irrespective of the stimulating strain. the inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-jun dimerization protein (jdp)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of jnk. our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects.  this underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.

TI  == macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus crispatus, and lactobacillus  casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x mic were evaluated in susceptible isolates. acquired resistance was defined as an increment in mic values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermb gene and a2058g mutation in 23s rrna were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin  and erythromycin than for tetracycline. serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. however, acquired resistance was rather unstable  and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. resistance to erythromycin was associated to a a2058g mutation in 23s rrna. in conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their  ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

AB  == the gut microflora is an important constituent in the intestinal mucosal barrier  and has been introduced as the concept of probiotic therapy that beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. therefore, the main objective of the study was to explore the protective potential of various lactobacilli strains for murine giardiasis. by experimentation, it was found that the probiotic supplementation of either lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, or l. rhamnosus gg, 7 days prior to inoculation with g. lamblia trophozoites, reduced the rate of cyst excretion compared with giardia-infected mice. interestingly, l. gg was found to be the most effective probiotic in reducing the duration of giardia cycle and acts as an effective prophylactic probiotic for murine giardiasis but needs to be clinically correlated due to entirely different human microflora.

TI  == quantitative transcript analysis of the inducible expression system psip: comparison of the overexpression of lactobacillus spp. beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == background: two sets of overlapping genes, laclmreu and laclmaci, encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, have previously been cloned and expressed using the psip vector system and lactobacillus plantarum wcsf1 as host. despite the high similarity between these laclm genes and the use of identical cloning and expression strategies, strains harboring laclmreu produced about twenty-fold more beta-galactosidase than strains containing laclmaci. results: in this study, the  plasmid copy numbers (pcn) of expression vectors peh9r (laclmreu) and peh9a (laclmaci) as well as the transcription levels of both laclm genes were compared  using quantitative pcr methods. analyses of parallel fermentations of l. plantarum harboring either peh9r or peh9a showed that the expression plasmids were present in similar copy numbers. however, transcript levels of laclm from l. reuteri (peh9r) were up to 18 times higher than those of laclm from l. acidophilus (peh9a). as a control, it was shown that the expression levels of regulatory genes involved in pheromone-induced promoter activation were similar in both strains. conclusion: the use of identical expression strategies for highly similar genes led to very different mrna levels. the data indicate that this difference is primarily caused by translational effects that are likely to affect both mrna synthesis rates and mrna stability. these translational effects  thus seem to be a dominant determinant for the success of gene expression efforts in lactobacilli.

TI  == prevalence and impact of single-strain starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria on metabolite formation in sourdough.
AB  == flavour of type ii sourdoughs is influenced by the ingredients, processing conditions, and starter culture composition. it is, however, not fully clear to what extent different sourdough lactic acid bacteria (lab) contribute to flavour. therefore, two types of flour (rye and wheat) and different lab starter culture strains were used to prepare sourdoughs, thereby leaving the yeast microbiota uncontrolled. all lab starter culture strains tested were shown to be prevalent and to acidify the flour/water mixture to ph values between 3.1 and 3.9 after 24h of fermentation. multiple aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids were produced by the sourdough-associated microbiota throughout the fermentation period. based on the organoleptic evaluation of breads produced with these sourdoughs, five lab strains were selected to perform prolonged wheat and rye fermentations as to their capacity to result in an acidic (lactobacillus fermentum imdo 130101, lactobacillus plantarum imdo 130201, and lactobacillus crustorum lmg 23699), buttermilk-like (lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471), or fruity flavour (lactobacillus sakei cg1). upon prolonged fermentation, higher metabolite concentrations were produced. for instance, l. sakei cg1 produced the  highest amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, which was further converted into 3-methylbutyl acetate. the latter compound resulted in a fruity banana flavour after 48h of fermentation, probably due to yeast interference. rye fermentations  resulted in sourdoughs richer in volatiles than wheat, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, and ethyl acetate.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria strains and fungal biota for potential use as starter cultures in dry-cured ham.
AB  == during the processing of dry-cured meat products, sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins undergo proteolysis, which has a marked effect on product flavor. microbial proteolytic activity is due to the action of mostly lactic acid bacteria (lab) and to a lesser extent micrococci. the proteolytic capacity of molds in various meat products is of interest to meat processors in the mediterranean area. eleven lab and mold strains from different commercial origins were tested for proteolytic activity against pork myosin, with a view to possible use of these strains as starter cultures for iberian dry-cured ham. proteolytic activity was tested by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the lab strains with the highest proteolytic activity were lactobacillus plantarum (l115), pediococcus pentosaceus (saga p tm), and lactobacillus acidophilus (fargo 606 tm). the best fungal candidate was penicillium nalgiovense lem 50i followed by penicillium digitatum, debaryomyces hansenii, and penicillium chrysogenum.

TI  == adherent properties and macrophage activation ability of 3 strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) must possess probiotic properties in order to be beneficial to humans and animals. the adherent properties, the acid and bile tolerance as well as the macrophage activation ability of isolated lab strains were investigated in this study. the adhesion was analyzed following heat, acid,  trypsin, and sodium periodate treatments. production of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) by raw 264.7 macrophages was also measured after stimulation with heat-killed lab strains. the viable strains of lactobacillus fermentum af7, l. acidophilus gg5, and l. plantarum bb9 were able to tightly adhere to the intestinal caco-2 cells. in addition, the gg5 strain was not affected by heating, acid, trypsin, or sodium periodate treatment. however, the adhesion of strains af7 and bb9 was reduced significantly by heating and trypsin treatment. this result suggested the gg5 and af7 or bb9 strains had different cell-surface adherent factors. tnf-alpha production by the raw 264.7 macrophages was induced significantly following stimulation with heat-killed lab  at 10(8) cfu/ml in a dose-dependent fashion. in addition, macrophage activity was similar whether the treatment consisted of live probiotics, or probiotics treated with heat, acid, or trypsin. however, the activity was reduced after treating with sonication. these in vitro results showed that the lab studied possess probiotic characteristics, such as acid or bile tolerance, adherent capability, and immune activation, and may suggest that these lab strains retain their probiotic activity as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == group-specific comparison of four lactobacilli isolated from human sources using  differential blast analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been used in fermentation processes for centuries. more recent applications including the use of lab as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. here we present a comparative genomic analysis of four completely sequenced lactobacillus strains, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1are all considered probiotic and widely used in industrial applications. using differential blast analysis (dba), each genome was compared to the respective remaining three other lactobacillus and 25 other lab genomes. dba highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other lab used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. initial comparative analyses highlighted a significant number of genes involved in cell adhesion, stress responses, dna repair and modification, and metabolic capabilities. furthermore, the range of the recently  identified potential autonomous units (paus) was broadened significantly, indicating the possibility of distinct families within this genetic element. based on in silico results obtained for the model organism l. acidophilus ncfm, dba proved to be a valuable tool to identify new key genetic regions for functional genomics and also suggested re-classification of previously annotated  genes.

AB  == probiotics and prebiotics, which can change the colonic microenvironment, are the areas of current interest. unutilizable fractions of the foods and fortificants,  which reach the colon can affect the profile of probiotics. effects of eight such factors viz. zinc sulphate, zinc carbonate, ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate, quercetin, gallic acid, phytic acid, and oxalic acid were, therefore, investigated on 24 h growth of lactobacillus acidophilus (l1) and lactobacillus plantarum (l2), two isolates of bifidobacteria (longum (l3) and bifidum (l4)) and a marketed consortium (l5) of eight probiotic cultures. mrs medium with marketed  fructooligosaccharide as the only source of carbon was used for study of dose response curves. quercetin and zinc sulphate showed significant positive effect for l1 and l5 (p < 0.01), whereas there was slight positive effect or no effect on growth of other probiotics. phytic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect for l2 and a slight inhibitory effect on l3 and l4 whereas l5 were able to tolerate phytic acid. oxalic acid had slight positive effect for l1 (p < 0.05) and l5 and no effect on growth of other probiotics (p > 0.05). further, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate, quercetin, and oxalic acid significantly inhibited growth of e. coli (p < 0.05)

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

AB  == this study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (gh42) beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus acidophilus (laca) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of onpg, pnpg and pnpg-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (goss) formation to gh2 beta-galactosidases of streptococcus thermophilus (lacz type), lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both laclm type). beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with l. lactis crude cell extract (cce). the novel gh42 beta-galactosidase of lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, onpg and pnpg but higher relative activity on pnp analogues compared to gh2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. temperature and ph optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between gh2 beta-galactosidases. onpg and pnpg were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pnpg-analogues was less than 1.5%. gh2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar gos with varying preferences. the diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in l. lactis cce can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.

TI  == new method for electroporation of lactobacillus species grown in high salt.
AB  == we here describe a new method for electroporation of lactobacillus species, obligately homofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative, based on the cell-wall weakening resulting from growth in high-salt media. for l. casei, optimum transformation efficiency of up to 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid dna was achieved following growth in the presence of 0.9 m nacl. plasmids of different sizes and replication origins were also similarly transformed. these competent cells could be used either directly or stored frozen, up to 1 month, for future use, with similar efficiency. this protocol was assayed with different lactobacillus species: l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum and l. acidophilus, and it was found that they were transformed with similar efficiency.

TI  == phytase activity from lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  == the presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. this study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of lab including: lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4962, atcc33200, atcc4356, atcc4161, l. casei ascc290, l. plantarum ascc276,  and l. fermentum vri-003. activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. most strains produced phytase under both conditions with l. acidophilus  atcc4161 showing the highest activity. phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with l. acidophilus atcc4962 and l. acidophilus atcc4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. all strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately ph 5. however, no phytate degradation could be observed.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == effect of live lactobacillus plantarum l2 on tnf-alpha-induced mcp-1 production in caco-2 cells.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum is a commensal bacterium that is known to ameliorate intestinal injury and inflammation caused by a wide variety of enteric pathogens. we hypothesized that l. plantarum may exert its probiotic effects by attenuation  of pro-inflammatory signaling induced by tnf-alpha. caco-2 cells were stimulated  with tnf-alpha in the presence of l. plantarum l2 and lactobacillus acidophilus la. the protein and mrna levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, mcp-1, were measured by elisa and rt-pcr, respectively. the effect of lactobacillus bacteria  on ikappabalpha degradation was further studied by western blotting. l. plantarum l2 and l. acidophilus la had no effect on mrna expression and production of mcp-1 in caco-2 cells. a significant elevation in mcp-1 mrna and protein expression in  caco-2 cells was detected after a 4h exposure to tnf-alpha. pre-incubation of caco-2 cells with l. plantarum l2 for 2h resulted in an attenuation of both mcp-1 protein production and mrna expression in tnf-alpha-stimulated cells. l. plantarum l2 also prevented ikappabalpha degradation in tnf-alpha-stimulated caco-2 cells. l. plantarum l2 inhibited mcp-1 secretion and mrna expression via a nf-kappab dependent pathway by interfering with ikappabalpha degradation in tnf-alpha-stimulated caco-2 cells.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == bioconversion of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and  vitamin b complex in fermented soymilk by probiotic bacteria and yeast.
AB  == aim: to study the role of beta-glucosidase producing probiotic bacteria and yeast in the biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and vitamin b complex in fermented soymilk. methods and results:  five isolates of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus  b4496, lactobacillus bulgaricus cfr2028, lactobacillus casei b1922, lactobacillus plantarum b4495 and lactobacillus fermentum b4655 with yeast saccharomyces boulardii were used to ferment soymilk to obtain the bioactive isoflavones, genistein and daidzein. high-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the concentration of isoflavones. bioactive aglycones genistein and daidzein after 24 and 48 h of fermentation ranged from 97.49 to 98.49% and 62.71  to 92.31% respectively with different combinations of lab with yeast. increase in bioavailability of minerals and vitamin b complex were also observed in fermented soymilk. conclusions: lab in combination with yeast s. boulardii has great potential for the enrichment of bioactive isoflavones, enhancing the viability of lab strains, decreasing the antinutrient phytic acid and increasing the mineral bioavailability in soymilk fermentation. significance and impact of the study: fermentation of soymilk with probiotic organisms improves the bioavailability of  isoflavones, assists in digestion of protein, provides more soluble calcium, enhances intestinal health and supports immune system. increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk improves the biological functionality of soymilk.

AB  == background: diarrhea has adverse consequences for critically ill patients, health care staff, and health care costs. objective: to evaluate the efficacy of the multispecies probiotic vsl#3 in reducing the mean number of episodes of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients. methods: a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was done in a 6-bed intensive care unit in a 330-bed public hospital in australia. a total of 45 adults (20 intervention, 25 control) who required enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were given vsl#3 or a placebo twice daily. the frequency (mean number of episodes per patient per day) and weight (grams per day) were determined for both liquid stool and liquid and loose (unformed) stool. results: the 2 groups of patients had no demographic or clinical differences. patients received enteral nutrition for a mean of 8.5 days (sd, 5.4) and were studied for a mean of 11.9 days (sd, 5.6). compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant reduction in the frequency of liquid stools (incidence rate ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.93; p = .03). smaller but still significant differences also occurred between the groups in both the frequency of episodes and the weight of liquid and loose (unformed) stool. conclusion: vsl#3 was effective in reducing the frequency of liquid stool in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. probiotics possibly can minimize diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed patients, but more controlled clinical trials are needed.

TI  == differential effects of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus plantarum strains on cytokine induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == lactic acid bacterial strains have received interest for their immunomodulating activities and potential use in probiotic products. a wide variety of strain-dependent properties have been reported, but comparative studies at the species level are scarce. the objective of this study was to assess the immunomodulatory effect of lactobacillus species on the cytokine profiles and proliferative response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hpbmc), and in particular, on the comparison between the species lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus plantarum. hpbmc from healthy donors were stimulated in the presence or absence of the lactic acid bacteria, and cytokine production, surface marker staining, proliferation and cell death were determined after 1 and 4 days  of culture. all lactobacillus strains tested were capable of inducing the production of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-10, interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). the bacterial strains did not differentially influence the amount of proliferating, viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. generally, l. plantarum showed a significantly higher induction capacity of ifn-gamma, il-12 and tnf-alpha compared with l. acidophilus. we conclude that the variation in immunomodulatory effects between species is even larger than the variation between the strains of the same species. in addition, we demonstrate that l. plantarum strains are most potent in skewing the t-cell differentiation toward a putative th1 response.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == use of pcr primers and probes based on the 23s rrna and internal transcription spacer (its) gene sequence for the detection and enumerization of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus plantarum in feed supplements.
AB  == novel polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers designed from the 16s-23s internal  transcription spacer (its) rrna and 23s rrna genes, respectively, were used for the specific detection of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus plantarum.  molecular weights of the pcr products were 221 and 599 bp, respectively. strains  of l. acidophilus and l. plantarum obtained from the culture center, dairy products, infant stool and other samples, could be identified with these pcr primers. dnas from other lactic acid bacteria (lab) species including strains of  lactobacillus pentosus which was closely related to l. plantarum, and bacteria species other than lab, would not generate the false positive results. when this  pcr primer set was used for the detection of l. acidophilus and l. plantarum in feed supplement or feed starter samples, reliable results were obtained. furthermore, when these l. acidophilus or l. plantarum specific primers were used as dna probes for the colony hybridization of l. acidophilus and l. plantarum, the viable cells of these lab species in culture and feed supplements or starter  products could be identified and enumerized. the method described here thus offers a rapid and economic way to inspect and assure the quality of the feed supplements or fermentation starters.

TI  == anti-inflammatory actions of probiotics through activating suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) expression and signaling in helicobacter pylori infection: a novel mechanism.
AB  == background and aims: in spite of the international agency for research on cancer's definition that helicobacter pylori is the definite carcinogen of gastric cancer, the simple eradication of the bug is not enough to prevent resultant gastric cancer, and increasing microbial resistance further limits the  eradication application. therefore, probiotics, non-pathogenic microbial feed that can affect the host in a beneficial manner, could be an alternate way to enhance anti-inflammation against h. pylori. however, the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory actions is still unclear. in the current study, we hypothesized that suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) signaling could be a feasible anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics against h. pylori infection. results: h. pylori infection or their lipopolysaccharide stimulation led to significant increased expressions of inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in ags cells and pretreatment of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly attenuated the expressions of these inflammatory mediators in accordance with the blocking action of nuclear factor-kappab nuclear translocation. probiotic administration increased expression of socs-2 and socs-3 and exerted the active socs signaling featured with earlier and higher expressions of socs-2 and socs-3. in contrast to weak inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases including p-38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, probiotic-induced socs expressions were mediated through either significant phosphorylation of signal transducers and activation of transcription (stat)-1 and stat-3 or simultaneous inhibition of janus kinase (jak)2 phosphorylation, which is known to signal socs-2/socs-3 negatively. conclusion: anti-inflammatory signals of socs through stat-1/stat-3 activation and jak2 inactivation might be a key anti-inflammatory mechanism of probiotics, setting probiotics as a non-microbial strategy to h. pylori infection.

TI  == probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  == microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. in the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. this has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. they play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. they are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. probiotic microorganisms include the lab lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response  or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. the advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.

TI  == high-level expression of lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system nice.
AB  == in this work the overlapping genes (lacl and lacm) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri , lb. acidophilus , lb. sakei , and lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (nice) vectors and expressed using lactococcus lactis nz9000 and nz3900 as hosts. the lacl gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisa. chloramphenicol  was employed as selection marker for the standard system using l. lactis nz9000,  whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacf gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing l. lactis nz3900. comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 ku/l of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the laclm genes and the selection marker used. the occurrence of codons less frequently used by l. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacl gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of laclm from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.

TI  == functional and probiotic attributes of an indigenous isolate of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == background: probiotic microorganisms favorably alter the intestinal microflora balance, promote intestinal integrity and mobility, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and increase resistance to infection. probiotics are increasingly used in nutraceuticals, functional foods or in microbial interference treatment. however, the effectiveness of probiotic organism is considered to be population-specific due to variation in gut microflora, food habits and specific  host-microbial interactions. most of the probiotic strains available in the market are of western or european origin, and a strong need for exploring new indigenous probiotic organisms is felt. methods and findings: an indigenous isolate lp9 identified as lactobacillus plantarum by molecular-typing methods was studied extensively for its functional and probiotic attributes, viz., acid and bile salt tolerance, cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and caco-2 cell-binding as well as antibacterial and antioxidative activities. lp9 isolate could survive 2 h incubation at ph 1.5-2.0 and toxicity of 1.5-2.0% oxgall bile.  lp9 could deconjugate major bile salts like glycocholate and deoxytaurocholate, indicating its potential to cause hypocholesterolemia. the isolate exhibited cell-surface hydrophobicity of approximately 37% and autoaggregation of approximately 31%. presence of putative probiotic marker genes like mucus-binding protein (mub), fibronectin-binding protein (fbp) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) were confirmed by pcr. presence of these genes suggested the possibility of specific interaction and colonization potential of lp9 isolate in the gut, which  was also suggested by a good adhesion ratio of 7.4+/-1.3% with caco-2 cell line.  the isolate demonstrated higher free radical scavenging activity than standard probiotics l. johnsonii la1 and l. acidophilus la7. lp9 also exhibited antibacterial activity against e. coli, l. monocytogenes, s. typhi, s. aureus and b. cereus. conclusion: the indigenous lactobacillus plantarum lp9 exhibited high  resistance against low ph and bile and possessed antibacterial, antioxidative and cholesterol lowering properties with a potential for exploitation in the development of indigenous functional food or nutraceuticals.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria differ in their ability to induce functional regulatory t cells in humans.
AB  == background: trials with probiotic lactic acid bacteria have yielded different results, which may be due to the strains used. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are known to be potent modulators of the immune system. the capacity of these bacteria used as probiotics to influence both t helper type 1 (th1)- and th2-mediated diseases has been shown before. however, the ability of strains to induce forkhead box p3 (foxp3(+)) expressing regulatory t cells has not yet been  investigated. objective: test the inherent differences between strains in their capacity to induce functional regulatory t cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). methods: human pbmc were co-cultured in vitro with either bifidobacterium lactis w51, lactobacillus acidophilus w55 or lactobacillus plantarum w62 or an escherichia coli control strain. the percentage of foxp3(+) cells, the origin of the induced cells and the functionality of these cells were  assessed. results probiotic strains differ in their capacity to induce regulatory t cells. foxp3(+) cells were induced from cd25(-) cells and were able to suppress effector t cells. naturally occurring regulatory t cells were not affected by co-culture with lactobacilli. il-10 concentrations found in the supernatant showed a trend towards the same differences between strains. blockade of il-10 did not influence the up-regulation of foxp3. no differences between lactic acid  bacteria were found in il-17, ifn-gamma or il-13. conclusions: some probiotic strains are potent inducers of regulatory cells, while others are not. the clear  differences between strains imply that an in vitro characterization of probiotic  strains before application is recommended.

AB  == aim: detection of morphophysiological changes in cells of manufacturing strains of lactobacilli suppressed by antagonistically active clinical cultures of candida albicans, isolated from women with torpid course of vaginosis and vaginitis. materials and methods: three clinical strains of c. albicans suppressing growth of bacterial cells from manufacturing strains of lactobacillus plantarum 8-pa-3, l. fermentum 90-4c and l. acidophilus d75 on modified agar-added nutrient medium were used. using electron microscopy, ultrastructural  changes in lactobacilli suppressed by c. albicans were studied. results: in places of tight contacts of interacting microorganisms, destructive changes in cell walls of lactobacilli appeared as desquamation of small layerwise fragments  of peptidoglycan layers were observed. rearrangement of ultrafine structure of lactobacilli's cytoplasm which expressed as destruction of protein-ribosomal complex was also noted. local defects of cellular components led to total destruction of cytoplasmic contents and appearance of "cellular shadows". conclusion: surmounting by c. albicans the antagonistic action of lactobacilli with destruction of peptidoglycan layer of their cell walls could explain persistence of yeast fungi during chronic forms of vaginosis in women.

AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == characterization of rhamnosidases from lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus  acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. in the genome of lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(lp)  and ram2(lp)) were identified, while in lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (rama(la)). gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into escherichia coli and were then tested for their  enzymatic properties. ram1(lp), ram2(lp), and rama(la) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while rama(la) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. subsequently, the potential application of lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. recombinant ram1(lp) and rama(la) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to ph 6. the potential of ram1(lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis. this system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. while import of flavonoids into l. lactis appeared to  be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == an improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-l-lysine (popl) to alginate (alg) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. eight strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l.  acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with popl. electron microscopy was  used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. to assess if the addition of popl improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both alg and popl microcapsules were inoculated into ph 2.0 mrs broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used  to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in alg and popl microcapsules. to assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 fam), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a uv spectrophotometer. the results indicated that coating the microcapsules with popl increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. however, microcapsules with added popl had a much smoother surface texture  when examined under an electron microscope. the results also indicated that the addition of popl to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log cfu/ml when compared to alg microcapsules at 2 h of exposure  to acidic conditions. however, similar plate counts were observed between alg and popl microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. this suggests that an extra coating of popl could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (git). upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that popl microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.

TI  == effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == ten probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-04, b. lactis type bi-07, howaru l. rhamnosus, and howaru b. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. the various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at ph 2 over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. the permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-cf). the permeability  was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-cf released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log cfu/ml was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. all encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-cf; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. in general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.

TI  == influence of oligosaccharides on the growth and tolerance capacity of lactobacilli to simulated stress environment.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli should resist stress environments in industry process and gastrointestinal tract before exerting their beneficial effects. to explore the possible stabilizers in probiotic products, prebiotic oligosaccharides were investigated. methods and results: we investigated the effect of four selected oligosaccharides on the survival of probiotic lactobacillus plantarum and l. acidophilus to simulated stress conditions. it was found that the tolerance of lactobacilli to simulated artificial gastrointestinal juice, heat treatment and phenol solution was obviously enhanced in fructo-oligosaccharides (fos) and xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) group. in addition, chito-oligosaccharides (cos), manno-oligosaccharides (mos) and glucose also had positive effect compared with control group (without sugar). conclusions: prebiotic oligosaccharides, especially xos and fos added in medium have protection function to lactobacilli in stress environments. the protection function of oligosaccharides may correlate with the bacteria growth, which was stimulated by these oligosaccharides. significance and impact of the study: prebiotic oligosaccharides may be used as stabilizers in probiotic products.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

TI  == the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. recent studies indicated that some lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. however, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. therefore, we examined the effects of lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (cl(-)/oh(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial  cells. postconfluent caco-2 cells were treated with the lactobacillus species lactobacillus acidophilus (la), lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, or  lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)cl uptake in base-loaded cells. treatment with live, but not heat-killed, la and lr significantly increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. similarly,  the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live la increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange. the ability of la or its conditioned culture medium to enhance cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was blocked by pi-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. corresponding to the increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity, la treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, slc26a3 [down regulated in adenoma (dra)]. the increased dra membrane localization might contribute to the increased cl(-) absorption by la. our results suggest that la secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.

TI  == interaction of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of il-8 production.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. the depletion of the individual  microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. in order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. in this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. according to our experimental data, lactobacillus acidophilus bar13, l. plantarum bar10, bifidobacterium longum bar33 and b. lactis bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli h10407 from a caco-2 cell layer. moreover, l. acidophilus bar13 and b. longum bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on il-8 production by ht29 cells. both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. these probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional  foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.

TI  == high-level expression of recombinant beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus sakei using a sakacin p-based expression system.
AB  == this work presents the cloning and expression of the genes encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri l103, lactobacillus acidophilus r22, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, and lactobacillus sakei lb790. these enzymes  consist of two subunits of approximately 73 and 35 kda, which are encoded by two  overlapping genes, lacl and lacm, respectively. we have cloned these genes into the lactobacillal expression vectors psip403 and psip409, which are based on the  sakacin p operon of l. sakei ( sorvig et al. microbiology 2005, 151, 2439- 2449 ), and expressed them in the host strains l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. sakei lb790.  results varied considerably, ranging from 2.23 to 61.1 u/mg of beta-galactosidase activity, depending on the origin of the laclm genes, the host strain, and the expression vector used. highest expression levels were obtained in a laboratory cultivation of l. plantarum wcfs1 harboring the plasmid peh3r containing the laclm gene from l. reuteri l103. these cultivations yielded approximately 23 000  u of beta-galactosidase activity per liter, corresponding to the formation of roughly 100 mg of recombinant protein per liter of fermentation medium, and beta-galactosidase levels amounted to 55% of the total intracellular protein of the host organism. to further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri was purified to apparent homogeneity. the properties of the purified enzyme were essentially identical with the properties of purified native beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri l103. the presented results lead the way to efficient overproduction of beta-galactosidase in a food-grade expression system, which is of high interest for applications in food industry.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

TI  == acid, bile, and heat tolerance of free and microencapsulated probiotic bacteria.
AB  == eight strains of probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07, were studied for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance. microencapsulation in alginate matrix was used to enhance survival of the bacteria in acid and bile as well as a brief exposure to  heat. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested using hcl in mrs broth over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested using 2 types of bile salts, oxgall and taurocholic acid, over an 8-h incubation period. heat tolerance was tested by exposing the probiotic organisms to 65 degrees c for up to 1 h. results indicated microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria in mrs containing hcl. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to oxgall, viability was reduced by 6.51-log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.36-log cfu/ml was lost in microencapsulated strains. at 30 min of heat treatment, microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived with an average loss of  only 4.17-log cfu/ml, compared to 6.74-log cfu/ml loss with free probiotic bacteria. however, after 1 h of heating both free and microencapsulated probiotic strains showed similar losses in viability. overall microencapsulation improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions, bile salts, and mild heat treatment.

TI  == fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of lactobacillus, namely, l. acidophilus atcc 4962, atcc33200, atcc 4356, atcc 4461, l. casei ascc  290, l. plantarum ascc 276, and l. fermentum vri-003. the parameters that were used are viability, ph, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees c. soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (aa). organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using hplc. viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) cfu/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d  storage at 4 degrees c. after 24 h, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in soluble calcium. l. acidophilus atcc 4962 and l. casei ascc 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. the increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered  ph associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. fermentation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. our  results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.

TI  == study on beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity of herbal yogurt.
AB  == different types of herbal yogurts were developed by mixing standardized milk with pretreated herbs, namely tulsi leaf (ocimum sanctum), pudina leaf (mentha arvensis) and coriander leaf (coriandrum sativum), with leaves separately and a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of the strains of lactic starter cultures---lactobacillus acidophilus (ncim 2903) and lactobacillus plantarum (ncim 2083)-followed by incubation at 40 degrees c for 6 h. the beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity of  the abovementioned herbal yogurts was determined and interestingly noted to exhibit higher enzymatic activity compared with the control yogurt (without any herbs). among all herbal yogurts, tulsi yogurt had the maximum beta-galactosidase activity.

TI  == selection and optimization procedure of synbiotic for cholesterol removal.
AB  == a selection and optimization procedure for the synbiotic combination of probiotic and prebiotics was established to optimize its cholesterol removal in vitro. in light of fermentability, prebiotics utilization by probiotics was highly variable and interspecies differences existed. based on the results of fermentability, l.  plantarum ls12, ls31, lp529 and l. ruminis la3 could be the better candidates for symbiotic research. the bile tolerance of all the tested strains could be improved by the strain-specific prebiotics comparing to the control carbon source (glucose). the strain ls12 was finally selected to form the symbiotic according to its better ability to ferment prebiotics and bile tolerance, while the five prebiotics (fos, stachyose, gos, imo and mannitol) were selected to make their synbiotic combination because of their better enhancement of bile tolerance and growth support to ls12. the synbiotic combination for cholesterol removal was optimized by use of response surface methodology. the first-order model showed that the selected prebiotics mannitol and gos were significant factors. then through the second-order polynomial regression model, the optimum conditions of the two factors for cholesterol removal by the synbiotic were suggested.

TI  == the importance of lactic acid bacteria for phytate degradation during cereal dough fermentation.
AB  == lactic acid fermentation of cereal flours resulted in a 100 (rye), 95-100 (wheat), and 39-47% (oat) reduction in phytate content within 24 h. the extent of phytate degradation was shown to be independent from the lactic acid bacteria strain used for fermentation. however, phytate degradation during cereal dough fermentation was positively correlated with endogenous plant phytase activity (rye, 6750 mu g(-1); wheat, 2930 mu g(-1); and oat, 23 mu g(-1)), and heat inactivation of the endogenous cereal phytases prior to lactic acid fermentation  resulted in a complete loss of phytate degradation. phytate degradation was restored after addition of a purified phytase to the liquid dough. incubation of  the cereal flours in buffered solutions resulted in a ph-dependent phytate degradation. the optimum of phytate degradation was shown to be around ph 5.5. studies on phytase production of 50 lactic acid bacteria strains, previously isolated from sourdoughs, did not result in a significant production of intra- as well as extracellular phytase activity. therefore, lactic acid bacteria do not participate directly in phytate degradation but provide favorable conditions for  the endogenous cereal phytase activity by lowering the ph value.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == selecting lactic acid bacteria for their safety and functionality by use of a mouse colitis model.
AB  == studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in inflammatory bowel disease. however, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. in this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three lactobacilli (lab) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced acute colitis. we first compared the in vitro ability of lab to survive gastrointestinal tract (git) conditions and their ability to persist in the git of mice following daily oral administration. as a control, we included a  nonprobiotic lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an endocarditis patient. feeding high doses of lab strains to healthy and to tnbs-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation of the bacteria. oral administration of lactobacillus salivarius ls-33 had a significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while lactobacillus plantarum lp-115 and lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm did not. none of the three selected lab strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of tnbs-treated mice. in contrast, l. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and translocated to extraintestinal organs. this study showed that evaluations of the safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. we conclude that not  all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that selected probiotics such as l. salivarius ls-33 may be considered in the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.

AB  == fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy was used in combination with multivariate statistical analysis for differentiation of lactic bacteria isolated from kefir grains. twelve reference strains and 42 lactobacilli isolates from four local kefir grains, previously identified by biochemical traditional techniques at species level were included in this study. the spectra were analysed by hierarchical clustering analysis (hca) using pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and ward's algorithm. the differentiation between homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli, proposed as a first level in the classification scheme, was performed with vector normalized first derivatives spectra in the windows 1789-1700, 1059-935, 3000-2927 and 896-833 cm(-1). for heterofermentative lactobacilli the windows 1780-1750, 1500-1200, 2950-2930 and 900-700 cm(-1) were found to contribute to the maximal separation among l. kefir, l. parakefir and lactobacillus brevis. it was also demonstrated that although this model was robust against small variations in growth temperature (+/-5 degrees c) and growth time (+/-5 h), the make of culture medium used (biokar or difco) affected the separation of heterofermentative lactobacilli at species level. for homofermentative lactobacilli the spectral regions 1230-900, 1777-1690, 1357-1240 and 2960-2870 cm(-1), were selected for discrimination among 5 different species that are normally present in kefir grains: l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. kefirgranum, l. kefiranofaciens and l. cassei. the classification and discrimination schemes proposed in this work completely matched with the identification obtained by classical biochemical techniques at species level.

AB  == the data obtained in the molecular genetic studies of the representatives of the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus are given. at present the genomes of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus plantarum sized 2,256.640, 1,993.564 and 3,308.274 base pairs respectively, were completely sequenced. the use of different methods of gene indication and gene typing essentially widened the existing notions of the species variety of these bacteria, made it possible to change the classification of known species and to find out new ones, vegetating in different biotopes of the human body. molecular  genetic approaches also ascertained the taxonomic position of production strains  of lactic-acid bacteria used in food industry, helped determine the kinetics of the passage of probiotic strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli along the gastrointestinal tract, as well as determine the duration of their preservation in the intestine after oral administration. in addition, the data on the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of some preparations, probiotics and synbiotics, with determination of the population level of endogenic and orally introduced exogenic bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are presented.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == the elimination of ochratoxin a by lactic acid bacteria strains.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine 29 strains of lactic acid bacteria of the lactobacillus and lactococcus genera, assessing their sensitivity to ochratoxin a and their ability to remove it from a liquid medium. it was demonstrated that most strains are insensitive to the presence of ota at the quantity of 5 microg/disc. it was demonstrated that all strains caused a reduction of the toxin amount in the liquid medium. the highest decrease, exceeding 50% of the initial ota content, was caused by the strains lactobacillus acidophilus ch-5, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum bs, l. brevis and l. sanfranciscensis. the example of  three selected strains confirmed the negative effect of the toxin on the dynamics of bacterial growth. a sharp decrease of ochratoxin a was observed during the first 15 hours of culture growth. in the course of cultivation the amount of the  toxin in the medium increased, indicating that the toxin elimination is partially reversible. a small quantity of ochratoxin a became bound to the bacterial biomass.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == genetic diversity, dynamics, and activity of lactobacillus community involved in  traditional processing of artisanal manchego cheese.
AB  == a total of 248 strains of predominant lactobacilli isolated during the manufacture and ripening of artisanal manchego cheeses obtained from two dairies  were obtained and the genetic diversity of 197 investigated using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd-pcr). 51 isolates could not be lysed and were therefore not genotyped. forty-two distinct rapd patterns, grouped in six major clusters at a similarity level of 54%, were obtained. phenotypic characterization of isolates enabled their assignment to the species l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. pentosus, l. acidophilus and l. curvatus. in samples from both dairies, the species l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei dominated during ripening. three genotypes showed excellent physiological characteristics and were therefore proposed as adjunct cultures for manchego cheese manufacture.

TI  == use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  == conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (kohonen self organizing map) and  supervised (bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, enterococcus, lactococcus and streptococcus including 47 reference strains. electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by piraino et al. [piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network  were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of  lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == potential of functional strains, isolated from traditional maasai milk, as starters for the production of fermented milks.
AB  == the purpose of this research was the evaluation of technological features and of  the ability of functional lab strains with desirable sensory characteristics, to  produce fermented milk. eight strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus paracasei and lactococcus lactis, isolated from maasai traditional fermented milk in kenya and previously tested for their probiotic properties, were selected for this investigation. technological features such as  growth kinetics in fresh heat-treated whole milk medium and survival in the final product during storage at 4 degrees c, were studied. the strains lb. acidophilus  bfe 6,059, lb. paracasei bfe 5,264 and lc. lactis bfe 6,049 showed the best potential and were thus selected for use as starter cultures in further trials with the objective to improve their technological performance and to optimise the sensory features of fermented milk obtained. the effects of fat (f), non-fat milk solids (s) and fermentation temperature (t), modulated according to a central composite design, on fermentation rates and viability losses during refrigerated  storage of the chosen starters, and on product texture parameters, were studied.  from the data analysis, it was possible to select optimum conditions for enhancing positive sensory traits of final products and for improving the survival of these potentially probiotic cultures.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of local lactobacillus strains (ntu 101 and 102) on cholesterol-lowering effects in vivo. thirty male hamsters were housed, divided into five groups, and fed on a cholesterol diet (5  g/kg diet) to induce hypercholesterolemia. milk fermented by lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ntu 101, lactobacillus plantarum ntu 102, and lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 17010 was administrated for this study. after treatment with different fermented milk, blood was taken and liver was removed for the determination of lipoproteins, including total cholesterol, high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), and triglyceride. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria decreased (10(5)) in the control group; when hamsters were fed on fermented milk, the number of lactobacilli (10(7)-10(8)) and bifidobacteria (10(5)-10(7)) was increased. serum and liver total cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by about 26.4, 23.5, and 30.1% and by about 17.7, 15.9, and 13.4% when hamsters were given fermented milk. however, serum hdl-c and ldl-c were also reduced. the results of this study showed that the hypocholesterolemic effect of local lactobacillus strains was attributed to its ability to lower serum and liver total cholesterol levels. thus, local lactobacillus strains could significantly increase probiotic count.

AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibilities and presence of plasmids in four new probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 (dr20) hn067, lactobacillus acidophilus hn017 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 (dr10), were determined. resistance to 18 commonly used antibiotics was assessed by disk diffusion. the three lactobacillus strains had similar antibiotic susceptibility  profiles to those of lactobacillus plantarum strain hn045 and two commercial probiotic lactobacillus strains, gg and la-1. the b. lactis strain hn019 had a similar profile to three commercial probiotic b. lactis strains (bb12, hn049 and  hn098). all 10 strains were sensitive to the gram-positive spectrum antibiotics erythromycin and novobiocin, the broad-spectrum antibiotics rifampicin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol and the beta-lactam antibiotics penicillin, ampicillin and cephalothin. by contrast, most strains were resistant  to the gram-negative spectrum antibiotics fusidic acid, nalidixic acid and polymyxin b and the aminoglycosides neomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin. all three l. rhamnosus strains (hn001, hn067 and gg) were resistant to vancomycin and several strains were also resistant to cloxacillin. of the four new probiotic strains, only l. rhamnosus hn001 contained plasmids; however, a plasmid-free derivative of hn001 had the same antibiotic susceptibility profile as the parent strain.

TI  == probiotication of tomato juice by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the suitability of tomato juice as a raw material for production of probiotic juice by four lactic acid bacteria (latobacillus acidophilus la39, lactobacillus plantarum c3, lactobacillus casei a4, and lactobacillus delbrueckii d7). tomato juice was inoculated with a 24-h-old culture and incubated at 30 degrees c. changes in ph, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell counts during fermentation under controlled conditions were measured. the lactic acid cultures reduced the ph to 4.1 or below and increased the acidity to 0.65% or higher, and the viable cell counts (cfu) reached nearly 1.0 to 9.0 x 10(9)/ml after 72 h fermentation. the viable cell counts of the four lactic acid bacteria in the fermented tomato juice ranged from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml after 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees c. probiotic tomato juice could serve as a health beverage for vegetarians or consumers who are allergic to dairy products.

TI  == potential of selected lactic acid bacteria to produce food compatible antifungal  metabolites.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential of lactic acid bacteria to inhibit the outgrowth of some common food-spoiling fungi. culture supernatants of 17 lactic acid bacterial strains as well as of three commercial probiotic cultures were evaluated for antifungal activity using an agar-diffusion method. the method parameters were chosen in order to reveal compounds for potential use  in food (bio)preservation. thirteen strains showed antifungal activity of which five strains were very promising: lactobacillus acidophilus lmg 9433, l. amylovorus dsm 20532, l. brevis lmg 6906, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis lmg 9196 and l. plantarum lmg 6907. four of these five strains were further examined; it was found that the produced antifungal metabolites were ph-dependent. the exact chemical nature of these substances has not been revealed yet.

TI  == starch-binding domain affects catalysis in two lactobacillus alpha-amylases.
AB  == a new starch-binding domain (sbd) was recently described in alpha-amylases from three lactobacilli (lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus manihotivorans). usually, the sbd is formed by 100 amino acids, but the sbd sequences of the mentioned lactobacillus alpha-amylases consist of almost 500 amino acids that are organized in tandem repeats. the three lactobacillus amylase genes share more than 98% sequence identity. in spite of this identity, the sbd structures seem to be quite different. to investigate whether the observed differences in the sbds have an effect on the hydrolytic capability of the enzymes, a kinetic study of l. amylovorus and l. plantarum amylases was developed, with both enzymes acting on several starch sources in granular and gelatinized forms. results showed that the amylolytic capacities of these enzymes are quite different; the l. amylovorus alpha-amylase is, on average, 10 times more efficient than the l. plantarum enzyme in hydrolyzing all the tested polymeric starches, with only a minor difference in the adsorption capacities.

TI  == the possible role of natural idiotopes in immune memory.
AB  == in this paper we report on the generation of abs possessing specificities similar to those of abs used in immunization, and on the generation of id and anti-id specificities in the sera of mice immunized with commensal bacterial antigens. the human monoclonal antibody igm dj (vh3/vl2) expresses natural antibody properties, natural idiotope (y7), and specificity towards lactic acid bacteria (lab). when used in immunization it generates lab-specific antibodies. immunization with lab, as detected in the presence of biotin-labelled mouse monoclonal anti-idiotopic antibodies y7 and igm dj generates abs1 and abs2, respectively. these findings may imply that the recognition of bacterial motifs accords with the rules of idiotypic network theory. this theory, first proposed by jerne in 1974 and often overlooked since, has been subject to change during the course of immunological research. recent experiments concerning the recognition of bacterial motifs and natural memory in the immune system have inspired us in our attempt at explaining the possible role of natural id in immune memory.

TI  == [adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to epithelium of different cavities of the human organism].
AB  == during investigation of adhesive properties of lactic acid bacteria it was found  out that 11 strains adhered to buccal intestinal and vaginal epithelium of human. the highest adhesive activity was detected in enterococci (adhesive index 7.75-14.26), lower one--in streptococci (6.40-9.16). in lactobacilli adhesive properties manifested in different ways: lactobacillus acidophilus strains adhered more often to buccal epithelium (2.58-4.60) and rarely--to intestinal and vaginal. l. plantarum manifested high adhesive activity (8.03 -9.69) to buccal epithelium and lower one--to the rest of epithelium types. monosaccharide composition of glycocalix of 6 strains of lactic acid bacteria was studied to understand the adhesion mechanism. it was shown that surface structures of this microorganism interact with plant lectins, specific to certain monosaccharides.

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == presence of drug resistance in intestinal lactobacilli of dairy and human origin  in turkey.
AB  == the prevalence of different resistance genes was investigated in lactobacilli of  human and dairy origin by pcr. the presence of erm, van, tet, and cat-tc genes were determined in 16 raw milk, 15 cream, 10 yogurt, 50 hand-made cheese, and 20  industrially produced white-cheese samples of dairy origin and 16 mouth, 32 fecal, and 36 vaginal samples from different subjects of human origin. lactobacilli of dairy and human origin were found to carry only erm(b) and tet(m) genes. the majority of the isolates, lactobacillus crispatus (61), lactobacillus  gasseri (49), lactobacillus plantarum (80) studied were found to harbor either erm(b) or tet(m) gene or both. no resistant lactobacilli was found in raw-milk and cream samples. all the human fecal samples and the majority of vaginal (29 of 36) and mouth (10 of 14) samples were found to carry the resistance genes. while  a third of the hand-made cheeses carried resistant lactobacilli only one industrially produced cheese was found to carry resistant lactobacilli. furthermore, the genes were found in the non-starter species, lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. plantarum, indicating that industrially produced cheeses in this respect could be considered more favorable. these results indicate that drug resistance seems to be very common in turkey. even though the number of dairy samples harboring the resistance genes (17 of 111) is smaller in regards to human samples, 10% of them were still found to carry the resistance genes as well. the  presence of the resistance genes in majority of the samples of human origin and in minority of the samples of dairy origin indicates that drug resistance may be  acquired in the intestinal tract during passage and spread to dairy products by the hands of workers during production.

TI  == genotypic analyses of lactobacilli with a range of tannase activities isolated from human feces and fermented foods.
AB  == a total of 77 tannase producing lactobacilli strains isolated from human feces or fermented foods were examined for their genotypic profiles and intensities of tannase production. with a pcr-based assay targeting reca gene, all strains except one isolate were assigned to either lactobacillus plantarum, l. paraplantarum, or l. pentosus whereas a 16/23s rdna targeted pcr-based assay identified all except 6 isolates (inclusive of the above one isolate) as one of the closely related species. subsequent dna/dna hybridization assays revealed that these 6 exceptional isolates showed low homology (between 1.2% and 55.8% relative dna binding) against type strains of the three species. supplemental carbohydrate fermentation profiles on the 6 isolates indicated that two of them were identified as l. acidophilus, one as pediococcus acidilactici, one as p. pentosaceus, and two remained unidentifiable. the evidence suggests that the 16/23s rdna targeted pcr assay can be used as a reliable identification tool for  the closely related lactobacilli, and that the tannase gene is widely distributed within members of the lactobacillaceae family. meanwhile, a randomly amplified polymorphism dna (rapd) analysis revealed that all except 8 isolates were well allocated in 4 major rapd clusters, though not species specific, consisting of two l. plantarum predominant clusters, one l. paraplantarum predominant, and one  l. pentosus predominant. the rapd patterns of the 8 non-clustered isolates, which consisted of the 6 unidentifiable isolates and 2 isolates identified as l. pentosus, were <40% similarity to those belonging to the 4 clusters. a quantitative assay of the tannase activities showed that there was a marked variation in the activities among the strains, which did not correlate with either species identification or clustering by rapd.

TI  == evaluation of the effect of malt, wheat and barley extracts on the viability of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria under acidic conditions.
AB  == in this work, the effect of cereal extracts, used as delivery vehicles for potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab), on the acid tolerance of the cells was evaluated under conditions that simulate the gastric tract. more specifically, the effect of malt, barley and wheat extracts on the viability of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri during exposure for 4 h in a phosphate buffer acidified at ph 2.5 was investigated. in the absence of cereal extracts all strains demonstrated a significant reduction in their cell population, particularly l. plantarum. the viability of l. plantarum was improved by approximately 4 log(10) cycles in the presence of malt and 3 log(10) cycles in the presence of wheat and barley. the survival of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri was increased by more than 1.5 and 0.7  log(10) cycle, respectively, upon addition of cereal extracts. in order to evaluate the contribution of the cereal constituents on cell survival, the individual effect of glucose, maltose and free amino nitrogen (fan), which were added at concentrations that correlated to the reducing sugar and fan content of  the cereal extracts, was examined. the viability of l. plantarum was progressively improved as the maltose or glucose concentration increased; an increase by approximately 2 log(10) cycles was observed in the presence of 8.33 g/l sugar. the survival of l. acidophilus increased by more than 1 log(10) cycle, even at very low concentrations of maltose and glucose (e.g., 0.67 g/l), while l. reuteri stability was enhanced in the presence of maltose but no appreciable effect was demonstrated in the presence of glucose. sugar analysis indicated that glycolysis was inhibited in all cases. addition of tryptone and yeast extract, used as sources of fan, enhanced l. acidophilus acid tolerance, but did not affect l. reuteri and l. plantarum. the results presented in this study indicate  that malt, wheat and barley extracts exhibit a significant protective effect on the viability of l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri under acidic conditions, which could be mainly attributed to the amount of sugar present in the cereal extracts.

AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == isolation, characterization and inhibition by acarbose of the alpha-amylase from  lactobacillus fermentum: comparison with lb. manihotivorans and lb. plantarum amylases.
AB  == extracellular alpha-amylase from lactobacillus fermentum (fermenta) was purified  by glycogen precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. the purification was approximately 28-fold with a 27% yield. the fermenta molecular mass (106,000 da)  is in the same range as the ones determined for l. amylovorus (amyloa), l. plantarum (plantaa) and l. manihotivorans (manihoa) alpha-amylases. the amino acid composition of fermenta differs from the other lactobacilli considered here, but however, indicates that the peptidic sequence contains two equal parts: the n-terminal catalytic part; and the c-terminal repeats. the isoelectric point of fermenta, plantaa, manihoa are approximately the same (3.6). the fermenta optimum ph (5.0) is slightly more acidic and the optimum temperature is lower (40 degrees c). raw starch hydrolysis catalyzed by all three amylases liberates maltotriose and maltotretaose. maltose is also produced by fermenta and manihoa. maltohexaose fermenta catalyzed hydrolysis produces maltose and maltotriose. finally, kinetics of fermenta, plantaa and manihoa using amylose as a substrate and acarbose as an  inhibitor, were carried out. statistical analysis of kinetic data, expressed using a general velocity equation and assuming rapid equilibrium, showed that: (1) in the absence of inhibitor k(cat)/km are, respectively, 1x10(9), 12.6x10(9)  and 3.2x10(9) s(-1) m(-1); and (2) the inhibition of fermenta is of the mixed non-competitive type (k(1i)=5.27 microm; l(1i)=1.73 microm) while the inhibition  of plantaa and manihoa is of the uncompetitive type (l(1i)=1.93 microm and 1.52 microm, respectively). whatever the inhibition type, acarbose is a strong inhibitor of these lactobacillus amylases. these results indicate that, as found  in porcine and barley amylases, lactobacillus amylases contain in addition to the active site, a soluble carbohydrate (substrate or product) binding site.

TI  == growth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cereal-based substrates.
AB  == aims: the overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (lactobacillus fermentum, lact. reuteri, lact. acidophilus and lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. the objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. methods and results: all fermentations were performed without ph control. a logistic-type equation, which  included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. in the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). the consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the ph of the medium. each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably  the ph, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. all strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. lactobacillus plantarum, lact. reuteri and  lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. in the barley and wheat media all strains, especially lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. this could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). in all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at ph values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. conclusions: the malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media  due to its chemical composition, while lact. plantarum and lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri. significance and impact of the study: cereals are  suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  == septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus,  and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.

TI  == characterisation and differentiation of lactobacilli by lectin typing.
AB  == lactobacillus isolates from healthy estonian and swedish children were characterised by a lectin typing technique; 56 isolates from six species (l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri) were tested. the typing system was based on an agglutination assay with a panel of six commercially available lectins, which were chosen on the basis of their carbohydrate specificities. the isolates were also subjected to proteolytic degradation before lectin typing to decrease auto-agglutination of whole cells in the assay. the 56 isolates were divided into 15 different lectin types by their lectin agglutination patterns. proteolytic treatment reduced auto-agglutination for the majority of species, apart from l. acidophilus, which remained predominantly auto-agglutinating (eight of nine strains). the system produced stable and reproducible results under standardised culture conditions. lactobacilli are important bacteria for use as probiotics and this system may supplement current molecular typing techniques and may help in identification of  strains that could be useful in this role.

AB  == primers and probes were established from the sequences of the alpha-amylase genes (amya) of l. amylovorus cip 102989 and of l. plantarum a6 (giraud and cuny 1997). they were successfully used for the detection of the amya gene in l. manihotivorans strain lmg 18010t and a 2842 bp region, containing the entire gene (2706 bp) with its putative promoter has been sequenced. more than 98% nucleotide sequence identities was found with l. amylovorus and l. plantarum amya genes. the deduced amino acid sequence shares more than 96% amino acid sequence identities with l. amylovorus and l. plantarum alpha-amylases, and also 65% and 59% identities with the alpha-amylases of b. subtilis and s. bovis, respectively. the 3' terminal part of l. manihotivorans lmg 18010t amya gene contained four repeated sequences (sru). the amya genes of the three lactobacilli species differed mainly in the number of sru and in the size of the flanking regions of the sru.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == [intestinal dysbacteriosis in antibacterial therapy and perspectives in treatment by antibiotic-resistant probiotics].
AB  == effect of different antibiotics and standard antibacterial therapy regimes on intestine microflora was investigated. lincozamides demonstrated the most negative effect. early addition of probiotics to the treatment with antibacterials had positive effect. susceptibility of 21 strains of normal microflora to 25 antibiotics was tested. resistance to antibiotics of lactobacilli varied significantly (more among strains and less among species). it was shown that l. acidophilus (probiotic "acilact") was resistant to metronidazole only. high resistance to antibiotics was shown for l. plantarum 8ra3, l. fermentum 90t4c (components of probiotic "lactobacterin"), l. fermentum  bl96, l. acidophilus bl and l. acidophilus (component of "linex"). susceptibility of microorganisms in complex formulation "linex" to the modern antibiotics was low. it is concluded that the use of stable antibiotic-resistant strains of normal microflora is favorable as addition to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest argentina.
AB  == indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest argentina. mean growth counts on m17, mrs, and mse agar media did not show significant differences (p < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. isolates of  lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as enterococcus (48%), lactococci  (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). all lactococci were identified  as lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. l. plantarum (93%), l. acidophilus (5%), and lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. l. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers.  l. plantarum and l. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. the majority of the lactobacilli and lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. enzyme activities (api-zym tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of l. plantarum strains were considerably higher. the predominance of l. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species triticum durum and triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of southern italy.
AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

AB  == lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. species such as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and  lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. in food, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy  products whereas l. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. a probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in sweden in 1994. the product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. it contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of l. plantarum 299v/l. the strain l. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. in humans, l. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. it can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption  and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. l. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. the mechanisms involved need to be clarified.

TI  == molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

TI  == comparative characterization of complete and truncated forms of lactobacillus amylovorus alpha-amylase and role of the c-terminal direct repeats in raw-starch  binding.
AB  == two constructs derived from the alpha-amylase gene (amya) of lactobacillus amylovorus were expressed in lactobacillus plantarum, and their expression products were purified, characterized, and compared. these products correspond to the complete (amya) and truncated (amyadelta) forms of alpha-amylase; amyadelta lacks the 66-kda carboxyl-terminal direct-repeating-unit region. amya and amyadelta exhibit similar amylase activities towards a range of soluble substrates (amylose, amylopectin and alpha-cyclodextrin, and soluble starch). the specific activities of the enzymes towards soluble starch are similar, but the k(m) and v(max) values of amyadelta were slightly higher than those of amya, whereas the thermal stability of amyadelta was lower than that of amya. in contrast to amya, amyadelta is unable to bind to beta-cyclodextrin and is only weakly active towards glycogen. more striking is the fact that amyadelta cannot bind or hydrolyze raw starch, demonstrating that the carboxyl-terminal repeating-unit domain of amya is required for raw-starch binding activity.

TI  == combined effect of sourdough lactic acid bacteria and additives on bread firmness and staling.
AB  == the effect of various sourdoughs and additives on bread firmness and staling was  studied. compared to the bread produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae 141, the chemical acidification of dough fermented by s. cerevisiae 141 or the use of sourdoughs increased the volume of the breads. only sourdough fermentation was effective in delaying starch retrogradation. the effect depended on the level of  acidification and on the lactic acid bacteria strain. the effect of sourdough made of s. cerevisiae 141-lactobacillus sanfranciscensis 57-lactobacillus plantarum 13 was improved when fungal alpha-amylase or amylolytic strains such as l. amylovorus cnbl1008 or engineered l. sanfranciscensis cb1 amy were added. when pentosans or pentosans, endoxylanase enzyme, and l. hilgardii s32 were added to the same sourdough, a greater delay of the bread firmness and staling was found.  when pentosans were in part hydrolyzed by the endoxylanase enzyme, the bread also had the highest titratable acidity, due to the fermentation of pentoses by l. hilgardii s32. the addition of the bacterial protease to the sourdough increased  the bread firmness and staling.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == stimulatory effect of honey on multiplication of lactic acid bacteria under in vitro and in vivo conditions.
AB  == the effect of honey and sucrose on lactic acid bacteria in vitro and in rat gut was studied to determine whether these organisms were affected differently by honey compared with sucrose. under in vitro conditions, the number of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus plantarum counts increased 10-100 fold in the presence of honey compared with sucrose. feeding of honey to rats also resulted in significant increase in counts of lactic acid bacteria. although there was no significant difference in the counts of lactic acid bacteria in the  small and large intestines of different groups, the honey-fed group showed a significant increase (p<0.05) in counts over the control and sucrose-fed animals. the results support the fact that consumption of honey has a beneficial effect on the physiological constitution of animals fed with it.

TI  == characterization of a phage resistance plasmid, plks, of silage-making lactobacillus plantarum ngri0101.
AB  == phage contamination has resulted in abnormal fermentation in silage. we isolated  a phage-resistant strain, lactobacillus plantarum ngri0101 from silage. the strain carried two plasmids, plkl (6.8 kb) and plks (2.0 kb). by curing and retransformation of the plasmids, we clarified that plks has phage resistant activity, characterized as no adsorption inhibition. plks has 2,025 bp and three  orfs, orfl23, orf132, and orf918. the predicted amino acid sequence of the orf918 product showed high similarity to those of rep proteins of pediococcus halophilus plasmid pucl287 and lactobacillus acidophilus plasmid pla103. the replication origin (ori) was upstream from orf918. there was no gene similar to typical phage resistant genes encoded by known plasmids. the phage resistance of l. plantarum ngri0101 may possibly be due to a plasmid-encoded abortive infection.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == microbiology of siljo, a traditional ethiopian fermented legume product.
AB  == siljo was prepared by thoroughly cooking powdered horsebean (vicia faba) in safflower (carthamus tinctorius) extract into a semi-solid slurry and then adding to it untreated black mustard (brassica nigra) powder after cooling to 50 degrees c. the black mustard powder was the source of starter microorganisms, with lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. delbruekii initiating and later dominating the fermentation process. the ph of the fermenting mass dropped to 4.5 within 36 h and reached 4.0 at 168 h. aerobic mesophilic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria were each present at about 1x10(10) c.f.u./ml after 36 h of fermentation but enterobacteriaceae were never detected. the dominant aerobic mesophilic flora consisted of micrococcus, bacillus and lactobacillus spp. crude protein, crude fat and ash increased slightly during the fermentation, with final values of around 28%, 25% and 7%, respectively, but there was a marked increase in protein  availability and concentration during the fermentation.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

TI  == enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == development of an amylolytic lactobacillus plantarum silage strain expressing the lactobacillus amylovorus alpha-amylase gene.
AB  == an amylolytic lactobacillus plantarum silage strain with the starch-degrading ability displayed by lactobacillus amylovorus was developed. an active fragment of the gene coding for alpha-amylase production in l. amylovorus was cloned and integrated into the chromosome of the competitive inoculant strain l. plantarum lp80 at the cbh locus. the alpha-amylase gene fragment was also introduced into l. plantarum lp80 on an autoreplicative plasmid. both constructions were also performed in the laboratory strain l. plantarum ncib8826. all four recombinant strains secreted levels of amylase ranging from 23 to 69 u/liter, compared with 47 u/liter for l. amylovorus. secretion levels were higher in l. plantarum ncib8826 than in l. plantarum lp80 derivatives and were higher in recombinant strains containing autoreplicative plasmids than in the corresponding integrants. the l. plantarum lp80 derivative containing the l. amylovorus alpha-amylase gene  fragment integrated into the host chromosome secreted alpha-amylase to a level comparable to that of l. amylovorus and was stable over 50 generations of growth  under nonselective conditions. it grew to a higher cell density than either the parent strain or l. amylovorus in mrs medium containing a mixture of starch and glucose as the fermentable carbohydrate source. this recombinant alpha-amylolytic l. plantarum strain would therefore seem to have considerable potential as a silage inoculant for crops such as alfalfa, in which water-soluble carbohydrate levels are frequently low but starch is present as an alternative carbohydrate source.

TI  == divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
AB  == we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in  the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from  that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in  part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus  rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.

TI  == detection of caries-inducing microorganisms in hyposalivated rats without infection of mutans streptococci.
AB  == rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and s. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against s. aureus. these results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. three strains of lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. the caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. after a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with l. fermentum ty1r. on the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either l. acidophilus ty7r or l. plantarum ty3r. these results indicate that l. fermentum may be one of causative  agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.

TI  == the aggregation of human platelets by lactobacillus species.
AB  == the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five  species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == accelerated natural lactic fermentation of cereal-based formulas at reduced water activity.
AB  == energy required to dehydrate fermented cereal-based food formulas plays a significant part in the production cost. therefore the effect of reduced moisture content on the fermentation was investigated. generally, lactic fermentation at reduced moisture content resulted in increased final ph. significant acidification still occurred at 0.33 kg water/kg dry matter corresponding to either aw = 0.925 in a sorghum-maize-soya (sms) mixture, or aw = 0.950 in a sorghum-maize-milk powder (smm) mixture. acidification adequate for microbiological safety (ph < or = 4.5) was achieved at 0.54 kg water/kg dm in sms (aw = 0.950) and 0.43 kg/kg dm in smm (aw = 0.965). in stable accelerated natural lactic fermentations obtained by inoculum recycling ('back-slopping') at 30 degrees c, dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, l. acidophilus and lactococcus lactis. dominating yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida krusei. l. plantarum isolated from high-moisture (1.5 kg/kg dry matter) sms fermentations had higher specific growth rates than l. plantarum isolated from reduced moisture (0.54 kg/kg dm) sms fermentations, when tested under similar aw conditions. this effect was not caused by previous culturing conditions; probably different strains of l. plantarum having different aw-optima dominate at high or reduced moisture conditions.

TI  == ecology of accelerated natural lactic fermentation of sorghum-based infant food formulas.
AB  == accelerated natural lactic fermentation of mixed sorghum-cowpea (formula 1) and sorghum-milkpowder (formula 2) infant food formulas was achieved by repetitive (60 fermentation cycles of 24 h each) use of the previous batch as an inoculum at a rate of 10% (w/w) and resulted in a gradual establishment of mixed populations  of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. in formula 1, early fermentation stages (fermentation cycles 1-4) were dominated by leuconostoc and lactococcus spp. which caused conditions inhibitive to yeasts. probably due to micronutrient deficiencies, the former lactic acid bacteria were succeeded by a combination of  lactobacillus plantarum and candida spp. achieving ph values 4.2-4.3. in formula  2, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis consistently achieved ph 3.7-3.8, thereby allowing only a minority of yeasts, mainly candida and trichosporon spp. none of the isolated yeasts exhibited 'killer'-activity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

AB  == cell wall, cytoplasm, polysaccharide, and peptidoglycan fractions prepared from lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, and l. acidophilus were examined for their efficacies to enhance resistance of host mice against listeria monocytogenes infection. intraperitoneal injections of those cellular fractions of l. casei led to elicitation of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity and the efficacy was highest in the case of peptidoglycan. macrophage ratio in the resultant peritoneal exudate cells was also highest in mice given peptidoglycan. macrophages induced with cell wall fraction of l. casei showed the most potent phorbol myristate acetate (pma)-triggered respiratory burst (chemiluminescence and o2- production determined on the basis of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) followed by those elicited with peptidoglycan. all the macrophages induced with cell wall of l. casei (two strains) and l. acidophilus enhanced o2- production in response to pma but l. plantarum did not enhance o2(-)-producing ability in such  a manner. the l. casei-cell wall also enhanced in vitro listericidal activity of  mouse peritoneal macrophages, but such an activity was not noted in the case of l. acidophilus-cell wall. when mice were intravenously given the cellular fractions 7 or 13 days before l. monocytogenes infection, cell wall fractions of  l. casei caused the most potent protective activity. a weak protective activity was also found in peptidoglycan of l. casei. therefore, the protective action of  l. casei against l. monocytogenes infection in host mice may be attributed to cell wall compounds and partially to the peptidoglycan moiety.

AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii , l. lactis and l. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. the presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. l. casei and l. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while l. casei also produced diacetyl. l. casei and l. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. l. helveticus and l. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate  under the conditions used.

TI  == [bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  == lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into  bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.

TI  == multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  == genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. helveticus, and l. acidophilus. after treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids.  successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to  isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at  least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. furthermore, the  growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. these findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == effect of lactobacilli on urinary indican excretion in gnotobiotic rats and in man.
AB  == the effect of lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (gbh-9 and gb-5) and in man was studied. l. salivarius, l. plantarum and l. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at  levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of l. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. daily feeding of lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of l. acidophilus. there was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. a significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. l. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. a negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.

TI  == factors affecting the quaternary structure of the allosteric l-lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvatus as investigated by hybridization and ultracentrifugation.
AB  == the allosteric l-lactate dehydrogenases of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus casei exist in the tetrameric from (molecular weight about 145 000) at ph 5.0--5.5 even in the absence of the effectors mn2+ and fru(1,6)p2 (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), but undergo reversible dissociation to monomers (molecular weight about 35 000) at higher ph values or in the presence of urea. in the range between ph 5.5 (tetrameric state) and ph 7.4 (monomeric state) the l. curvatus l-lactate dehydrogenase exists in a dissociation-association equilibrium comprising tetramers, dimers and monomers as indicated by the sc20,w values and the results of hybridization experiments. the simultaneous addition of both effectors [mn2+ and fru(1,6)p2] at ph 7.4, however, resulted in the stabilization of the tetrameric form. the addition of fru(1,6)p2 alone at ph 7.4 had almost no  influence on the quarternary structure, whereas the addition of mn2+, as well as  that of nadh, largely prevented dissociation. the l-lactate dehydrogenase of l. casei showed similar properties, although the enzyme dissociates only at about ph greater than or equal to 7.8. as in the case of the l. curvatus enzyme, fru(1,6)p2 has no influence on the ph-dependent dissociation of the l. casei enzyme, whereas mn2+ stabilizes the tetrameric structure. reconstitution of a mixture of the two dissociated enzymes results in the formation of all statistically possible, enzymatically active hybrids. no hybridization between the allosteric enzymes from l. casei and l. curvatus and the non-allosteric ones  of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus was observed.

TI  == [the microflora of sour dough. iv. communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  == the bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the  genus beijerinck. according to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: thermobacterium (l. acidophilus), streptobacterium (l. casei, l. plantarum, l. farciminis, l. alimentarius) and betabacterium (l. brevis, l. brevis var. lindneri, l buchneri,  l. fermentum, l. fructi vorans). in the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. in starter preparation "a" only the varieties l. fructi vorans and l. fermentum were present. preparation "b" contained a great variety of microorganisms with l. brevis and l. brevis l. lindneri predominating. in starter "c" l. brevis, l. plantarum and l. alimentarius predominated.

TI  == comparative studies of lactate dehydrogenases in lactic acid bacteria. amino-acid composition of an active-site region and chemical properties of the l-lactate dehydrogenase of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == the molecular weight, the amino acid composition and the n-terminal and c-terminal amino acids of two allosteric (lactobacillus casei, l. curvatus) and two non-allosteric (l. plantarum, l. acidophilus) l-lactate dehydrogenases, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, were determined. the amino acid composition of the only tryptic peptide unequivocally common to the fingerprints of the 4 enzymes is virtually identical with that of the arginine peptide, called arg6 of the the substratebinding site of the l-lactate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase of several animals. however, the 'essential' cysteine residue 165 is replaced by threonine, as it is in the l-lactate dehydrogenase of  lobster. in addition, the 4 bacterial peptides differ by one or two changes in single amino acid residues from each other as well as from those of animals. the  data indicate that not only the animal l-lactate dehydrogenases, but also the allosteric and lactate dehydrogenases from bacterial sources may have evolved from a common gene.

TI  == allosteric and non-allosteric phosphofructokinases from lactobacilli. purification and properties of phosphofructokinases from l. plantarum and l. acidophilus.
AB  == phosphofructokinase (atp : d-fructose-6-phosphate 1 phosphotransferase, ec 2.7.1.11) from two different lactobacilli, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated and purified. both enzymes have a molecular weight of 154 000 and consist of four subunits of identical size. antisera from sheep immunized against the purified phosphofructokinase from l. plantarum showed immunologic cross reaction with the enzyme from l. acidophilus.  in spite of the close molecular relationship indicated by the immunologic cross reaction, the kinetic behaviour of the two enzymes was strikingly different. phosphofructokinase from l. plantarum showed pure michaelis-menten behaviour. phosphofructokinase from l. acidophilus, however, showed sigmoidal substrate saturation curves for fructose 6-phosphate in the presence of slightly alkaline ph and high atp concentrations; it was activated by fructose 1,6-biphosphate and  inhibited by adp. the results indicate that even enzymes which are structurally very similar may differ greatly with respect to their kinetic and regulatory properties and suggest that allosteric and non-allosteric phosphofructokinases have the same origin in evolution.

TI  == amino acid profiles and presumptive nutritional assessment of single-cell protein from certain lactobacilli.
AB  == the amino acid profiles, modified essential amino acid (meaa) indexes, and in vitro pepsin digestibilities were determined for single-cell protein (scp) from certain industrially important lactobacilli. for the three parameters examined, substantial differences were seen between different lactobacillus species and between strains with a given species. scp from all of the lactobacilli examined appeared relatively high in meaa indexes and pepsin digestibility. scp from l. acidophilus 3205 and l. fermenti 3954 had the highest meaa indexes, whereas l. bulgaricus 2217 and l. thermophilus 3863 had the highest percentage of digestible crude protein. scp from l. plantarum strains had the lowest meaa indexes. the essential amino acid compositions of scp from different lactobacilli appear comparable to that of food and agriculture organization reference protein and scp from other sources.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
