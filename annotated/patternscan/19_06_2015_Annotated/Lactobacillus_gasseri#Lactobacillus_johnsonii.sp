TI  == lactobacillus gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, for growth in milk.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri is a widespread commensal lactic acid bacterium inhabiting  human mucosal niches and has many beneficial effects as a probiotic. however, l.  gasseri is difficult to grow in milk, which hurts usability for the food industry. it had been previously reported that supplementation with yeast extract or proteose peptone, including peptides, enables l. gasseri to grow well in milk. in this study, our objective was to confirm peptide requirement of l. gasseri and evaluate efficacy of peptide release by enzymatic proteolysis on growth of l. gassei in milk. three strains of l. gasseri did not grow well in modified deman,  rogosa, sharpe broth without any nitrogen sources (mrs-n), but addition of a casein-derived peptide mixture, tryptone, promoted growth. in contrast, little effect was observed after adding casein or a casein-derived amino acid mixture, casamino acids. these results indicate that l. gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, among milk-derived nitrogen sources for growth. lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t hardly had growth capacity in 6 kinds of milk-based media: bovine milk, human milk, skim milk, cheese whey, modified mrs-n (mrsl-n) supplemented with acid whey, and mrsl-n supplemented with casein. moreover, treatment with digestive proteases, particularly pepsin, to release peptides made it grow well in each milk-based medium. the pepsin treatment was the most effective for growth of strain jcm 1131t in skim milk among the tested food-grade proteases such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, calf rennet, ficin, bromelain, and papain. as well as strain jcm 1131t, pepsinolysis of milk improved growth of other l. gasseri strains and some strains of enteric lactobacilli such  as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus reuteri. these results suggest that some relatives of l. gasseri also use peptides as desirable nitrogen sources, and that milk may be a good supplier of nutritious peptides to enteric lactobacilli including l. gasseri after peptic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. this is the first report showing peptide requirement of l. gasseri and efficacy of pepsinolysis on the growth of l. gasseri and its relatives in milk. this study would contribute to increasing usability of l. gasseri and its relatives as probiotics in dairy foods.

TI  == lactobacillus rodentium sp. nov., from the digestive tract of wild rodents.
AB  == three strains of regular, long, gram-stain-positive bacterial rods were isolated  using tpy, m.r.s. and rogosa agar under anaerobic conditions from the digestive tract of wild mice (mus musculus). all 16s rrna gene sequences of these isolates  were most similar to sequences of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323t and lactobacillus johnsonii atcc 33200t (97.3% and 97.2% sequence similarities, respectively). the novel strains shared 99.2-99.6% 16s rrna gene sequence similarities. type strains of l. gasseri and l. johnsonii were also most related  to the newly isolated strains according to rpoa (83.9-84.0% similarities), phes (84.6-87.8%), atpa (86.2-87.7%), hsp60 (89.4-90.4%) and tuf (92.7-93.6%) gene sequence similarities. phylogenetic studies based on 16s rrna, hsp60, rpoa, atpa  and phes gene sequences, other genotypic and many phenotypic characteristics (results of api 50 chl, rapid id 32a and api zym biochemical tests; cellular fatty acid profiles; cellular polar lipid profiles; end products of glucose fermentation) showed that these bacterial strains represent a novel species within the genus lactobacillus. the name lactobacillus rodentium sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate this group of new isolates. the type strain is mymrs/tlu1t (=dsm 24759t=ccm 7945t).

TI  == molecular detection of lactobacillus species in the neovagina of male-to-female transsexual women.
AB  == there is a general opinion that penile skin lined neovagina of transsexual women  is not able to support the growth of lactobacilli. this study was undertaken to prove if lactobacilli strains could survive in neovagina and to characterise the  most dominant lactobacillus species. sixty three male-to-female transsexual women without abnormal vaginal discharge, clinical signs of infection were recruited on an ongoing basis from among transsexual outpatients in an academic research institution and tertiary care centre. neovaginal smears were taken for molecular  lactobacillus spp. profiling by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). lactobacillus species were detected from 47/63 transsexual women (75%). the 279 lactobacillus signals detected by pcr-dgge technique belonged to 13 different species. lactobacilli of the l. delbrueckii group (l. gasseri, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. iners, l. jensenii) were predominant. more than 90% of women harboured a combination of two or more neovaginal lactobacillus species. in this study we report the frequent occurrence of lactobacilli from neovagina of transsexual women. both, frequency and composition were similar to the normal lactic acid bacterial microflora in both women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women.

TI  == molecular analysis and clinical significance of lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  == lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. we determined the genotypic identification of >100 lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) cfu/ml from urine). this study assessed the clinical  significance and the frequency of occurrence of each lactobacillus sp. we identified 16 species of lactobacillus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, 10 of  which could not be associated with disease. while lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, l. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus delbrueckii were  associated with at least one infection. species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., l. rhamnosus and l. casei) were identical, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. human isolates of lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.

TI  == development of a tiered multilocus sequence typing scheme for members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  == members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of purported health benefits they impart to the consumer. many characteristics of these microorganisms are reported to be strain specific. therefore, proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product labeling, and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production purposes. fifty-two strains of the l. acidophilus complex (l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. gallinarum, l. gasseri, and l. johnsonii) were genotyped using two established methods and compared to a novel multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme. pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis of the hsp60 gene with alui and taqi successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species examined, but it lacked strain-level discrimination. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr (rapd-pcr) targeting the m13 sequence resulted in highly discriminatory profiles  but lacked reproducibility. in this study, an mlst scheme was developed using the conserved housekeeping genes fusa, gpma, gyra, gyrb, lepa, pyrg, and reca, which  identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into  the six species. analysis of the observed alleles suggests that nucleotide substitutions within five of the seven mlst loci have reached saturation, a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the l. acidophilus complex and our unconventional application of a typically intraspecies molecular typing tool. our mlst results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a multispecies complex, with the potential for taxonomic expansion to a broader collection of lactobacillus species.

TI  == characterization of the genome of the dairy lactobacillus helveticus bacteriophage {phi}aq113.
AB  == the complete genomic sequence of the dairy lactobacillus helveticus bacteriophage phiaq113 was determined. phage phiaq113 is a myoviridae bacteriophage with an isometric capsid and a contractile tail. the final assembled consensus sequence revealed a linear, circularly permuted, double-stranded dna genome with a size of 36,566 bp and a g+c content of 37%. fifty-six open reading frames (orfs) were predicted, and a putative function was assigned to approximately 90% of them. the phiaq113 genome shows functionally related genes clustered together in a genome structure composed of modules for dna replication/regulation, dna packaging, head and tail morphogenesis, cell lysis, and lysogeny. the identification of genes involved in the establishment of lysogeny indicates that it may have originated as a temperate phage, even if it was isolated from natural cheese whey starters as a virulent phage, because it is able to propagate in a sensitive host strain.  additionally, we discovered that the phiaq113 phage genome is closely related to  lactobacillus gasseri phage kc5a and lactobacillus johnsonii phage lj771 genomes. the phylogenetic similarities between l. helveticus phage phiaq113 and two phages that belong to gut species confirm a possible common ancestral origin and support the increasing consideration of l. helveticus as a health-promoting organism.

TI  == the effect of a bacillus-based direct-fed microbial supplemented to sows on the gastrointestinal microbiota of their neonatal piglets.
AB  == direct-fed microbials (dfm) supplemented in sow diets may confer health benefits  to the host and their piglets by reducing pathogens in the sow and environment. in this study we evaluated the effect of a bacillus-based dfm on the gastrointestinal microbiota of neonatal piglets. a total of 208 sows were divided into 2 treatments: a control diet and the control diet supplemented with a bacillus subtilis-based dfm (3.75 x 10(5) cfu/g feed). twenty-one piglets sampled from each sow treatment group were euthanized on d 3 of lactation followed by an  additional 15 piglets per treatment on d 10 of lactation. litters from dfm-supplemented sows had greater (p = 0.02) weaning weights and a tendency (p =  0.09) for improvement in litter adg. sows supplemented with the dfm weaned more pigs (p = 0.06) than control sows which was reflected in numerically lower but not statistically different (p = 0.12) decrease in piglet mortality in dfm litters. terminal rflp was used to characterize gastrointestinal (gi) microbial populations in the ileum and colon of the piglets. terminal restriction fragments (t-rf) were compared between control and dfm treatments. there was a greater incidence and quantity of t-rf b423 and h330 (binary p = 0.01, 0.08; quantitative p = 0.01, 0.05, respectively), putatively identified as lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii, in the ileum of pigs nursing sows supplemented with dfm at d 3. terminal restriction fragment peaks b423 and h330 were also greater (binary p  = 0.01, 0.08; quantitative p = 0.01, 0.01, respectively) in the colon of pigs nursing sows supplemented with dfm at d 3. peaks m495 and b394, putatively identified as e. coli, were greater (binary p = 0.01, 0.04; quantitative p = 0.01, 0.01, respectively) in the colon of the control pigs at d 3. at d 10, both  the presence and quantity of lactobacillus species were greater (p < 0.05) in the colon of pigs with the dfm treatment. additionally, there was a tendency for t-rf b227 and h257 (binary p = 0.07, 0.07, respectively), putatively identified as clostridium perfringens, to be present in the ileum of the control pigs at d 10 compared with treated pigs. results of this study reveal that the developing gastrointestinal microbiota of a neonatal piglet can be affected by dfm supplementation to the sow.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == mrna profiling for vaginal fluid and menstrual blood identification.
AB  == the detection and identification of human biological fluids, including vaginal secretions and menstrual blood, are highly important in forensic biology. previous studies have proposed a few mrna and bacterial markers for vaginal fluid detection, but they have not proven to be specific and reliable. the aim of this  project was to develop, validate and evaluate a reliable, specific test for vaginal fluid identification that would combine detection of vaginal mrnas and lactobacilli. we have developed a hexaplex that detects hbd1 (human beta-defensin 1), muc4 (mucin 4), menstrual blood marker mmp11 (matrix metalloproteinase 11), housekeeping gene g6pdh (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and the 16s-23s rrna  intergenic spacer region of lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus gasseri/lactobacillus johnsonii. we analysed the specificity of the markers and variations among women, as well as the sensitivity of the test and its ability to detect vaginal fluid in mixtures with semen and blood. this approach allows for the detection of vaginal fluid in stains that were up to 2 years old, if stored at room temperature and up to 18 years old if stored frozen. through simultaneous analysis of 5 vaginal markers, the proposed hexaplex ensures high specificity and reliability in the detection of vaginal material.

TI  == different impacts of purified and nonpurified diets on microbiota and toll-like receptors in the mouse stomach.
AB  == we compared the colonization of lactobacilli in the stomachs of mice fed nonpurified and purified diets and examined to determine whether the expression of toll-like receptor 2, which is involved in the recognition of lactobacilli, is influenced by diet. female balb/c mice were fed a nonpurified or a purified diet  for 2 weeks. conventional cultivation and cultivation-independent molecular biological analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed that the number  of lactobacilli associated with the gastric tissue was significantly higher in the mice fed the nonpurified diet than in those fed the purified diet. sequencing analysis indicated that l. gasseri and l. johnsonii were predominant lactobacillus species associated with the gastric tissue of the mice fed the nonpurified diet. the mrna levels of toll-like receptor 2, but not of 9, in the gastric tissue were significantly higher in the mice fed the purified diet than in those fed the nonpurified diet. we propose that nonpurified and purified diets have different impacts on gastric microbiota, which can in turn influence the expression of toll-like receptor 2 in the stomach.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == group-specific comparison of four lactobacilli isolated from human sources using  differential blast analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been used in fermentation processes for centuries. more recent applications including the use of lab as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. here we present a comparative genomic analysis of four completely sequenced lactobacillus strains, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1are all considered probiotic and widely used in industrial applications. using differential blast analysis (dba), each genome was compared to the respective remaining three other lactobacillus and 25 other lab genomes. dba highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other lab used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. initial comparative analyses highlighted a significant number of genes involved in cell adhesion, stress responses, dna repair and modification, and metabolic capabilities. furthermore, the range of the recently  identified potential autonomous units (paus) was broadened significantly, indicating the possibility of distinct families within this genetic element. based on in silico results obtained for the model organism l. acidophilus ncfm, dba proved to be a valuable tool to identify new key genetic regions for functional genomics and also suggested re-classification of previously annotated  genes.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == characterization of a novel lactobacillus species closely related to lactobacillus johnsonii using a combination of molecular and comparative genomics methods.
AB  == background: comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) constitutes a powerful tool for identification and characterization of bacterial strains. in this study we have applied this technique for the characterization of a number of lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal content of rats fed with a diet supplemented with sorbitol. results: phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene, reca, phes, pyrg and tuf sequences identified five bacterial strains isolated from the intestinal content of rats as belonging to the recently described lactobacillus taiwanensis species. dna-dna hybridization experiments confirmed that these five  strains are distinct but closely related to lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri. a whole genome dna microarray designed for the probiotic l. johnsonii strain ncc533 was used for cgh analysis of l. johnsonii atcc 33200t, l. johnsonii bl261, l. gasseri atcc 33323t and l. taiwanensis bl263. in these experiments, the fluorescence ratio distributions obtained with l. taiwanensis and l. gasseri showed characteristic inter-species profiles. the percentage of conserved l. johnsonii ncc533 genes was about 83% in the l. johnsonii strains comparisons and decreased to 51% and 47% for l. taiwanensis and l. gasseri, respectively. these results confirmed the separate status of l. taiwanensis from  l. johnsonii at the level of species, and also that l. taiwanensis is closer to l. johnsonii than l. gasseri is to l. johnsonii. conclusion: conventional taxonomic analyses and microarray-based cgh analysis have been used for the identification and characterization of the newly species l. taiwanensis. the microarray-based cgh technology has been shown as a remarkable tool for the identification and fine discrimination between phylogenetically close species, and additionally provided insight into the adaptation of the strain l. taiwanensis bl263 to its ecological niche.

AB  == background: although probiotic bacteria and their metabolites alter enterocyte gene expression, rapid, non-genomic responses have not been examined. the present study measured accumulation of tracer (2 microm) glucose by caco-2 cells after exposure for 10 min or less to a chemically defined medium (cdm) with different monosaccharides before and after anaerobic culture of probiotic lactobacilli. results: growth of l. acidophilus was supported by cdm with 110 mm glucose, fructose, and mannose, but not with arabinose, ribose, and xylose or the sugar-free cdm. glucose accumulation was reduced when caco-2 cells were exposed for 10 min to sterile cdm with glucose (by 92%), mannose (by 90%), fructose (by 55%), and ribose (by 16%), but not with arabinose and xylose. exposure of caco-2  cells for 10 min to bacteria-free supernatants prepared after exponential (48 h)  and stationary (72 h) growth phases of l. acidophilus cultured in cdm with 110 mm fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83% and 45%, respectively; exposure to a suspension of the bacteria had no effect. the increase in glucose accumulation  was diminished by heat-denaturing the supernatant, indicating the response of caco-2 cells is triggered by as yet unknown heat labile bacterial metabolites, not by a reduction in cdm components that decrease glucose uptake. supernatants prepared after anaerobic culture of l. gasseri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. johnsonii in the cdm with fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83%, 32%, 27%, and 14%, respectively. conclusion: the rapid, non-genomic upregulation of sglt1 by bacterial metabolites is a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotics and the intestinal epithelium.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from silage.
AB  == strain firdi 006t, isolated from silage cattle feed, was characterized by using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the strain was a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium; the cells stained gram-positive and were catalase-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs phylogenetically to the genus  lactobacillus and can be placed within the lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii  group. lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii were the most closely related species, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 99.53 and 99.46% to  the respective type strains. low gyrb gene sequence similarities (<90%) and low dna-dna reassociation values (<45%) were obtained between the strain and the phylogenetically closest neighbours. based on phenotypic and genetic evidence, the strain is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is firdi 006t (=bcrc 17755t =dsm 21401t).

TI  == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current  protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein  sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively  important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

AB  == the complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from lactobacillus casei zhang  was determined. plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. for the first time, we identified a relbe toxin-antitoxin (ta) locus in a lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. a region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. the cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pwcfs103 and  pmrc01 from lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis, respectively. comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. in addition, two chromosome-encoded relbe systems in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri were identified.

TI  == analysis of the genome sequence of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 reveals the molecular basis of an autochthonous intestinal organism.
AB  == this study presents the complete genome sequence of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323, a neotype strain of human origin and a native species found commonly in the gastrointestinal tracts of neonates and adults. the plasmid-free genome was 1,894,360 bp in size and predicted to encode 1,810 genes. the gc content was 35.3%, similar to the gc content of its closest relatives, l. johnsonii ncc 533 (34%) and l. acidophilus ncfm (34%). two identical copies of the prophage lgai (40,086 bp), of the sfi11-like siphoviridae phage family, were integrated tandomly in the chromosome. a number of unique features were identified in the genome of l. gasseri that were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer and may contribute to the survival of this bacterium in its ecological niche. l. gasseri encodes two restriction and modification systems, which may limit bacteriophage infection. l. gasseri also encodes an operon for production of heteropolysaccharides of high complexity. a unique alternative sigma factor was present similar to that of b. caccae atcc 43185, a bacterial species isolated from human feces. in addition, l. gasseri encoded the highest number of putative  mucus-binding proteins (14) among lactobacilli sequenced to date. selected phenotypic characteristics that were compared between atcc 33323 and other human  l. gasseri strains included carbohydrate fermentation patterns, growth and survival in bile, oxalate degradation, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, in vitro. the results from this study indicated high intraspecies variability from a genome encoding traits important for survival and retention in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == the role of prophage for genome diversification within a clonal lineage of lactobacillus johnsonii: characterization of the defective prophage lj771.
AB  == two independent isolates of the gut commensal lactobacillus johnsonii were sequenced. these isolates belonged to the same clonal lineage and differed mainly by a 40.8-kb prophage, lj771, belonging to the sfi11 phage lineage. lj771 shares  close dna sequence identity with lactobacillus gasseri prophages. lj771 coexists  as an integrated prophage and excised circular phage dna, but phage dna packaged  into extracellular phage particles was not detected. between the phage lysin gene and attr a likely maze ("antitoxin")/pemk ("toxin") gene cassette was detected in lj771 but not in the l. gasseri prophages. expressed pemk could be cloned in escherichia coli only together with the maze gene. lj771 was shown to be highly stable and could be cured only by coexpression of maze from a plasmid. the prophage was integrated into the methionine sulfoxide reductase gene (msra) and complemented the 5' end of this gene, creating a protein with a slightly altered  n-terminal sequence. the two l. johnsonii strains had identical in vitro growth and in vivo gut persistence phenotypes. also, in an isogenic background, the presence of the prophage resulted in no growth disadvantage.

TI  == ecophysiology of the developing total bacterial and lactobacillus communities in  the terminal small intestine of weaning piglets.
AB  == weaning of the pig is generally regarded as a stressful event which could lead to clinical implications because of the changes in the intestinal ecosystem. the functional properties of microbiota inhabiting the pig's small intestine (si), including lactobacilli which are assumed to exert health-promoting properties, are yet poorly described. thus, we determined the ecophysiology of bacterial groups and within genus lactobacillus in the si of weaning piglets and the impact of dietary changes. the si contents of 20 piglets, 4 killed at weaning (only sow  milk and no creep feed) and 4 killed at 1, 2, 5, and 11 days post weaning (pw; cereal-based diet) were examined for bacterial cell count and bacterial metabolites by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). lactobacilli were the predominant group in the si except at 1 day pw because of a marked reduction in their number. on day 11 pw, bifidobacteria and e. coli were not detected, and enterobacteriaceae and members of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale cluster were only found occasionally. l. sobrius/l. amylovorus became dominant species whereas the abundance of l. salivarius and l. gasseri/johnsonii declined. concentration of lactic acid increased pw whereas ph, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia decreased. carbohydrate utilization of 76 lactobacillus spp. isolates was studied revealing a shift from lactose and galactose to starch, cellobiose, and xylose, suggesting that the bacteria colonizing the si of piglets adapt to the newly introduced nutrients during the early weaning period. identification of isolates based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence data and comparison with fermentation data furthermore suggested adaptation processes below the species level. the results of our study will help to understand intestinal bacterial ecophysiology and to develop nutritional regimes to prevent or counteract complications during the weaning transition.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == similarity and differences in the lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  == a set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. multilocus sequence analysis, dna typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. on microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of l. johnsonii. when projected on the ncc533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. a quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile dna. signatures for horizontal  gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in dna from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. on microarray hybridizations, lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence  intensities than the l. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from l. acidophilus hybridized to the l. johnsonii array. in-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of l. johnsonii with l. gasseri, l. acidophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with lactobacillus casei; and scattered x-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. the observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the l. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

AB  == the effect of growth conditions on adhesion was studied in six species belonging  to lactobacillus acidophilus homology groups. namely, 17 strains including 6 fresh isolates of l. gasseri from human feces were assessed for their adherence to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen. these extracellular matrix proteins were used as a model of damaged intestinal mucosa. when the bacteria were grown on mrs agar under anaerobic conditions, all eight l. gasseri  strains and one l. johnsonii strain showed strong adhesiveness to laminin, but not when grown in static mrs broth. a similar pattern was observed in four l. gasseri strains in terms of adherence to fibronectin. no l. gasseri or l. johnsonii strains exhibited adhesion to type iv collagen under either growth condition. adhesion of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus, and l. gallinarum was not affected by the growth conditions. although protease treatment of l. gasseri cells abolished the adhesion, periodate oxidation of the cells increased it except in one strain. the adherence of l. gasseri cells was diminished by periodate and alpha-mannosidase treatments of immobilized laminin.  the above results suggest that mannose-specific proteinaceous adhesion can be induced in l. gasseri by contact with a mucosal surface in the anaerobic intestinal lumen.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  == molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. samples were cultured on blood agar and rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% co(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. dna was also extracted directly from the samples and 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr with universal primers. pcr products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. only three taxa, streptococcus mutans, rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed propionibacterium sp., were found in  all five samples. the predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel propionibacterium sp. (18%), olsenella profusa (14%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). the predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were streptococcus mutans (16%), lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). there was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (p < 0.05, wilcoxon matched pairs, signed  ranks test). in conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous  novel taxa are present.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == the genome sequence of the probiotic intestinal bacterium lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533.
AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 is a member of the acidophilus group of intestinal lactobacilli that has been extensively studied for their "probiotic" activities that include, pathogen inhibition, epithelial cell attachment, and immunomodulation. to gain insight into its physiology and identify genes potentially involved in interactions with the host, we sequenced and analyzed the 1.99-mb genome of l. johnsonii ncc 533. strikingly, the organism completely lacked genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, purine nucleotides,  and most cofactors. in apparent compensation, a remarkable number of uncommon and often duplicated amino acid permeases, peptidases, and phosphotransferase-type transporters were discovered, suggesting a strong dependency of ncc 533 on the host or other intestinal microbes to provide simple monomeric nutrients. genome analysis also predicted an abundance (>12) of large and unusual cell-surface proteins, including fimbrial subunits, which may be involved in adhesion to glycoproteins or other components of mucin, a characteristic expected to affect persistence in the gastrointestinal tract (git). three bile salt hydrolases and two bile acid transporters, proteins apparently critical for git survival, were also detected. in silico genome comparisons with the >95% complete genome sequence of the closely related lactobacillus gasseri revealed extensive synteny  punctuated by clear-cut insertions or deletions of single genes or operons. many  of these regions of difference appear to encode metabolic or structural components that could affect the organisms competitiveness or interactions with the git ecosystem.

TI  == use of group-specific and rapd-pcr analyses for rapid differentiation of lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  == the increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. in  this study, group-specific pcr and rapd-pcr analyses were used to identify strains of the lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. group-specific pcr with primers for the l. casei and l. acidophilus groups, as well as l. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. for identification of these strains to species or strain level, rapd profiles of the 20 lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the l. acidophilus and l. casei group. all except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, and l. paracasei. dna reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the rapd-pcr.

TI  == the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill h. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent il8 release. in vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent h. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. thirteen clinical trials have  been published. in six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these  had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. in seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of  antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. the results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in h. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).

TI  == new integration vector using a cellulase gene as a screening marker for lactobacillus.
AB  == the new integration vector for lactobacillus, pjc4, was developed using the extracellular endoglucanase a gene (cela) of clostridium thermocellum as a screening marker. pjc4 was transformed into four lactobacillus species, lb. johnsonii, lb. gasseri, lb. bulgaricus, and lb. plantarum. in each species, the pjc4 integrants were easily and accurately detected by the appearance of a clear  halo on a cellulase screening plate without any false transformants. polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization indicated that all transformants with clear halos contained pjc4 in their chromosomal dnas. the cela gene could be a useful screening marker for other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == identification and characterization of novel surface proteins in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == we have identified and sequenced the genes encoding the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) protein from six different strains of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri. both species harbor two apf genes, apf1 and apf2, which are in the same orientation and encode proteins of 257 to 326 amino acids. multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of these apf genes demonstrate a very strong sequence conservation of all of the genes with the exception of their central regions. northern blot analysis showed that both genes are transcribed, reaching their maximum expression during the exponential phase.  primer extension analysis revealed that apf1 and apf2 harbor a putative promoter  sequence that is conserved in all of the genes. western blot analysis of the licl cell extracts showed that apf proteins are located on the cell surface. intact cells of l. johnsonii revealed the typical cell wall architecture of s-layer-carrying gram-positive eubacteria, which could be selectively removed with licl treatment. in addition, the amino acid composition, physical properties, and genetic organization were found to be quite similar to those of s-layer proteins. these results suggest that apf is a novel surface protein of the lactobacillus acidophilus b-homology group which might belong to an s-layer-like family.

TI  == characterization of the lactobacillus casei group and the lactobacillus acidophilus group by automated ribotyping.
AB  == a total of 91 type and reference strains of the lactobacillus casei group and the l acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device riboprinter microbial characterization system. the l. casei group was divided into five (c1-c5) genotypes by ribotyping. among them, the strain of l. casei atcc 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of l. paracasei strains and l casei jcm 1134t generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of l. zeae. these results supported the designation of l. casei atcc  334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of l. casei jcm 1134t as l. zeae. the l. acidophilus group was also divided into 14  (a1-a11, b1-b3) genotypes by ribotyping. l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus and l. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by l. gasseri and l. johnsonii. this result confirmed previous data that the l. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. five strains of l. acidophilus and two strains of l. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. most strains belonging to the l. casei group and the  l. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. thus this riboprinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible  genetic information for the identification of many strains.

AB  == a broad-spectral bacteriocin, named gassericin t, produced by lactobacillus gasseri sbt 2055 (from human feces) was isolated to homogeneity from the culture  supernatant by hydrophobic chromatography. by sds-page and in situ activity assay, the purified gassericin t migrated as a single band with bacteriocin activity and molecular size of 5,400. a 2.9-kbp hindiii-hindiii fragment of chromosome dna was hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe designed from the partial n-terminal amino acid sequence of gassericin t and was cloned. six orfs including the structural gene of gassericin t were deduced by computer analysis and the data bases. the structural gene of gassericin t (gata) was identified as  the fourth orf, which encoded a protein composed of 75 amino acids that included  the gg motif of the cleavage site. chemical sequencing analysis of the complete amino acid sequence showed that gassericin t (57 amino acids) had a disulfide bond in the molecule and no modified amino acid residues, making it a class ii bacteriocin. the gassericin t had 60% sequence similarity to mature lafa (57 amino acids, lactacin f, bacteriocins produced by l. johnsonii vpi11088), and the sequences around the processing site and c-terminal area were well conserved. the fifth orf was designated as gatx, encoded as a peptide composed of 65 amino acids containing the gg motif of the putative cleavage site, however mature gatx and its antibacterial activity were not detected in the culture supernatant. gatx has higher similarity with lafx than with lactobin a (50 amino acids) belonging to the first lactacin f-family. these results indicated that gassericin t belongs to the hydrophobic class ii bacteriocins and the most vicinal lactacin f-family.

TI  == a polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  == a set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the lactobacillus acidophilus rrna-group have been analysed by sds-page of cellular proteins, rapd-pcr and aflp with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. gallinarum, l. helveticus, l. iners and l. amylolyticus. although the majority of the species can be differentiated by sds-page of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains and between some strains of l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum. however, this study shows that the rapd-pcr (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and aflp are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. the separate species status of the recently described l. amylolyticus and l. iners was fully confirmed.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == functional analysis of the gene encoding immunity to lactacin f, lafi, and its use as a lactobacillus-specific, food-grade genetic marker.
AB  == lactacin f is a two-component class ii bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088. the laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafa and lafx, and a third open reading frame, orfz. two strategies were employed to study the function of orfz. this gene was disrupted in the chromosome of nck64, a lafa729 lafx orfz derivative of vpi 11088. a disruption cassette consisting of orfz interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into psa3 and introduced into nck64. manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of orfz with the cat gene. this orfz mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin f but had little effect on production of lafx, which is not bactericidal without lafa. expression of orfz in this orfz- background rescued the immune phenotype. expression of orfz in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of vpi 11088 also reestablished immunity. these data indicate that orfz, renamed lafi, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin f system. the sensitivity of various lactobacillus strains to lactacin f was further evaluated. lactacin f inhibited 11 strains including several members of the a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, and b2  l. acidophilus homology groups. expression of lafi in bacteriocin-sensitive strains l. acidophilus atcc 4356, l. acidophilus ncfm/n2, l. fermentum ncdo1750,  l. gasseri atcc 33323, and l. johnsonii atcc 33200 provided immunity to lactacin  f. furthermore, it was shown that lactacin f production by vpi 11088 could be used to select for l. fermentum ncdo1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding lafi. the data demonstrate that lafi is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.

AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == evaluation of random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr as a method to differentiate lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus johnsonii.
AB  == the technique random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr was evaluated as a method to differentiate lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus johnsonii. representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from different clusters obtained by numerical analysis of  total soluble cell protein patterns. results obtained by rapd-pcr corresponded well with results obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. the type strains of each species displayed different rapd profiles. strains with identical l(+)- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent lactic dehydrogenase (nldh) electrophoretic profiles could be distinguished on the basis of their rapd profiles.

TI  == isolation of a novel is3 group insertion element and construction of an integration vector for lactobacillus spp.
AB  == an insertion sequence (is) element from lactobacillus johnsonii was isolated, characterized, and exploited to construct an is-based integration vector. l. johnsonii nck61, a high-frequency conjugal donor of bacteriocin production (laf+) and immunity (lafr), was transformed to erythromycin resistance (emr) with the shuttle vector psa3. the nck61 conjugative functions were used to mobilize psa3 into a laf- lafs ems recipient. dna from the emr transconjugants transformed into escherichia coli mc1061 yielded a resolution plasmid with the same size as that of psa3 with a 1.5-kb insertion. the gram-positive replication region of the resolution plasmid was removed to generate a psa3-based suicide vector (ptrk327)  bearing the 1.5-kb insert of lactobacillus origin. plasmid ptrk327 inserted randomly into the chromosomes of both lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 and vpi 11759. no homology was detected between plasmid and total host dnas, suggesting a rec-independent insertion. the dna sequence of the 1.5-kb region revealed the characteristics of an is element (designated is1223): a length of 1,492 bp; flanking, 25-bp, imperfect inverted repeats; and two overlapping open reading frames (orfs). sequence comparisons revealed 71.1% similarity, including 35.7% identity, between the deduced orfb protein of the e. coli is element is150 and the putative orfb protein encoded by the lactobacillus is element. a putative frameshift site was detected between the overlapping orfs of the lactobacillus is element. it is proposed that, similar to is150, is1223 produces an active transposase via translational frameshifting between two tandem, overlapping orfs.

TI  == hemagglutination activity of lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the cells of 28 strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group were evaluated for hemagglutination (ha) activity. the activity was found in the surface layer (sl)  protein fraction extracted by 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. the most sl proteins from the a group strains (l. acidophilus (a1), l. crispatus (a2), l. amylovorus (a3), and l. gallinarum (a4)) showed ha activity, but the proteins from the b group strains (l. gasseri (b1) and l. johnsonii (b2)) showed no activity. the sl  proteins from the a group strains were composed in common of a main component having molecular mass of about 40-45 kda on sds-page. the sl proteins from jcm 1034 strain that showed the highest ha activity was fractionated by cm-toyopearl  ion-exchange chromatography. the highest ha activity was detected in the major protein of 41 kda. this protein was purified and shown to be composed of about 50% of hydrophobic amino acids. the ha activity of the protein (1034 lectin) was  specifically inhibited by fetuin and bovine lactoferrin at the concentrations of  80 and 160 micrograms/ml, respectively. the removal of n-acetylneuraminic acid from fetuin significantly decreased the inhibitory activity.

TI  == identification and classification of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains by sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization.
AB  == thirty-two strains originally identified as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. gasseri were screened for their taxonomic homogeneity by sds-page of whole-cell proteins. after numerical comparison of the resulting protein electrophoretic fingerprints, two well-delineated clusters were detected. the majority of the strains grouped in one electrophoretic cluster, which contained the type strain of l. acidophilus and corresponds to dna group a1 of johnson, j. l., phelps, c. f., cummins, c. s., london, j. & gasser, f. (1980; international journal of systematic bacteriology 30, 53-68). another cluster corresponded to dna group b.  it contained two subclusters, which agreed perfectly with dna subgroups b1 (l. gasseri) and b2 (l. johnsonii), respectively. the 23s rrna genes were partially sequenced and 23s-rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for identification of dna groups a1, b1 and b2. probe lbg reacted with all strains of electrophoretic cluster b1 (l. gasseri), probe lbj hybridized with strains of cluster b2 (l. johnsonii) and probe lba with strains of cluster a1 (authentic l.  acidophilus). the probes were successfully used for the identification of strains belonging to the respective species. the phylogenetic relationship of a representative of l. johnsonii was determined by comparative sequence analysis of the 16s rrna genes. it is very closely related to l. gasseri.
