TI  == production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == helicobacter mustelae and helicobacter pylori bind to common lipid receptors in vitro.
AB  == helicobacter pylori is a recently recognized human pathogen causing chronic-active gastritis in association with duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer.  helicobacter mustelae is a closely related bacterium with similar biochemical and morphologic characteristics. h. mustelae infection of antral and fundic mucosa in adult ferrets causes chronic gastritis. an essential virulence property of both helicobacter species is bacterial adhesion to mucosal surfaces. the aim of this study was to determine whether h. mustelae binds to the same lipids shown previously to be receptors for h. pylori adhesion in vitro. by using thin-layer chromatography overlay and a receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, h. mustelae was found to bind the same receptor lipids as h. pylori, namely, phosphatidylethanolamine and gangliotetraosylceramide. in addition, both h. pylori and h. mustelae bound to a deacylplasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamine. in  contrast to h. pylori, h. mustelae binding to receptors was unaffected by motility or viability. murine monoclonal and bovine polyclonal antibodies against exoenzyme s, and exoenzyme s itself (from pseudomonas aeruginosa), inhibited binding of h. mustelae to phosphatidylethanolamine and gangliotetraosylceramide.  these findings show that h. mustelae binds in vitro to the same lipid receptors as h. pylori and suggest that the adhesion of h. mustelae to such species is mediated by preformed, surface-exposed adhesins which include an exoenzyme s-like protein.
