TI  - Effects of Ensiling Fermentation and Aerobic Deterioration on the Bacterial Community in Italian Ryegrass, Guinea Grass, and Whole-crop Maize Silages Stored at High Moisture Content.
AB  - The effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in Italian ryegrass (IR), guinea grass (GG), and whole-crop maize (WM) silages. Direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-Butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the IR, GG, and WM silages, respectively. The acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of GG ensiling. Pantoea agglomerans, Rahnella aquatilis, and Enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the IR silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri and Bacillus pumilus were detected when IR silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community at silo opening. Lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the GG silage. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. Enterobacter cloacae appeared when the GG silage was spoiled. In the WM silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. Throughout the ensiling, Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella confusa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. lactis. Upon deterioration, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Bacillus gibsonii were detected. These results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling and aerobic spoilage of IR, GG, and WM silages.
TI  - Molecular identification of microbial community in surface and undersurface douchi during postfermentation.
AB  - To find the reason for fermentation failure of surface Douchi during postfermentation, the microbial communities in undersurface and surface samples were investigated using cell counting method and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results showed that the microbial biomass in surface Douchi was obviously different from that in undersurface Douchi even sampled from the same fermentation tanks, and a 10- to 100-fold reduction of microbial cell counts in undersurface had been observed. The bacterial DGGE profile and principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated that only Lactococcus lacts subsp. lactis and Bacillus thermoamylovorans were detected from surface Douchi, while Lactococcus lacts subsp. lactis, Staphylococcus lentus and 2 uncultured strains occupied the dominant positions in undersurface Douchi; when amplified using Bacillus-specific primers, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter sp. were found in undersurface Douchi, while only Bacillus thermoamylovorans were detected from surface Douchi; compared to the bacteria and Bacillus, the DGGE profiles and PCA plot of fungi indicated that the fungal community between surface and undersurface Douchi was similar and mainly composed by yeasts. In this study, we detected the microbial biomass and species in postfermentation stage of Douchi, and the various microbial diversity in undersurface and surface samples might be the cause of the fermentation failure in surface fermentation tanks.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Characterisation of the spoilage bacterial microbiota in oyster gills during storage at different temperatures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spoilage bacterial community in oyster gill was investigated during storage at 4, 10 and 20 degrees C. Aerobic plate counts and pH values were determined. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from oyster gill and bulk cells of plate count media. The major bacterial species during fresh or different temperatures storage were determined by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). RESULTS: The initial aerobic plate count in oyster gill reached 6.70 log CFU g(-1). PCR-DGGE fingerprinting analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region revealed that most of the strains in fresh oyster gill belonged to the genera Lactococcus and Enterobacter. The major spoilage bacteria at a storage temperature of 20 degrees C were Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, an uncultured bacterium, Cytophaga fermentans, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudoalteromonas sp., Enterococcus mundtii, Clostridium difficile and an uncultured Fusobacteria; those at 10 degrees C were Lactococcus spp., Lactobacillus curvatus, Weissella confusa and C. difficile; those at 4 degrees C were Lactococcus, Weissella, Enterobacter and Aeromonas. The other minor species were L. curvatus, Pseudomonas sp. and E. mundtii. Lactococcus spp. was the most common main spoilage bacteria in oyster gill during chilled storage. CONCLUSION: PCR-DGGE revealed the complexity of the bacterial microbiota and the major bacteria species in oyster gill for fresh and storage.
TI  - Potential application of the nisin Z preparation of Lactococcus lactis W8 in preservation of milk.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin Z from Lactococcus lactis W8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees C were identified as Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. These bacteria were found to have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. Except Enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin Z preparation of the L. lactis W8. Addition of the nisin Z preparation to either the skim milk or fat milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log CFU ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. The nisin Z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. CONCLUSIONS: The nisin Z preparation from L. lactis W8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin Z preparation of L. lactis W8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin A). The nisin Z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.
TI  - Microbial production of palatinose through extracellular expression of a sucrose  isomerase from Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 in Lactococcus lactis MG1363.
AB  - Sucrose isomerase (SIase) has been used to produce palatinose, a structural isomer of sucrose, which has many beneficial health properties, such as low-glycemic and low-insulinemic indices. A gene corresponding to SIase from Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 was expressed in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 using the P170 expression system. The autoinducible promoter (P170) and an optimized signal peptide (SP310mut2) were used to induce and secrete SIase in L. lactis. One-step Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and Western blot analysis demonstrated that SIase was successfully secreted to the culture supernatant, although 60% of the recombinant enzymes were retained inside the cells. The production of the recombinant SIase was highly correlated with pH (pH 6) and glucose concentration (30g/L) of the medium. The extracellularly produced recombinant SIase was functionally active, effectively transforming 50g/L sucrose to 36g/L palatinose, with a conversion rate of 72% in the culture supernatant.
TI  - Usefulness of length heterogeneity-PCR for monitoring lactic acid bacteria succession during maize ensiling.
AB  - The use of length-heterogeneity PCR was explored to monitor lactic acid bacteria  succession during ensiling of maize. Bacterial diversity was studied during the fermentation of 30-day-old maize in optimal and spoilage-simulating conditions. A length heterogeneity PCR profile database of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the silage and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was established. Although interoperonic 16S rRNA gene length polymorphisms were detected in some isolates, strain analysis showed that most of the lactic acid bacteria species thriving in silage could be discriminated by this method. The length heterogeneity PCR profiles of bacterial communities during maize fermentation were compared with those on a database. Under optimal fermentation conditions all the ecological indices of bacterial diversity, richness and evenness, deduced from community profiles, increased until day thirteen of fermentation and then decreased to the initial values. Pediococcus and Weissella dominated, especially in the first days of fermentation. Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus brevis were mainly found after six days of fermentation. A peak corresponding to Lactobacillus plantarum was present in all the fermentation phases, but was only a minor fraction of the population. Unsuitable fermentation conditions and withered maize leaves in the presence of oxygen and water excess caused an enrichment of Enterococcus sp. and Enterobacter sp.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Product of the Lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  - Malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when L-malate is present in the medium. The activation of the malolactic system in Lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mleR. Induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mleR. The mleR gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the predicted MleR gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: LysR, IlvY gene products of Escherichia coli, MetR, CysB of Salmonella typhimurium, AmpR of Enterobacter cloacae, NodD of Rhizobium sp., and TrpI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
