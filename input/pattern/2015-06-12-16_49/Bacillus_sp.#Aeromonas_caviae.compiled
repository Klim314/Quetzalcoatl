TI  - Air-dust-borne associations of phototrophic and hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms: promising consortia in volatile hydrocarbon bioremediation.
AB  - Aquatic and terrestrial associations of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms active in hydrocarbon bioremediation have been described earlier. The question arises: do similar consortia also occur in the atmosphere? Dust samples at the height of 15 m were collected from Kuwait City air, and analyzed microbiologically for phototrophic and heterotrophic hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms, which were subsequently characterized according to their 16S rRNA gene sequences. The hydrocarbon utilization potential of the heterotrophs alone, and in association with the phototrophic partners, was measured quantitatively. The chlorophyte Gloeotila sp. and the two cyanobacteria Nostoc commune and Leptolyngbya thermalis were found associated with dust, and (for comparison) the cynobacteria Leptolyngbya sp. and Acaryochloris sp. were isolated from coastal water. All phototrophic cultures harbored oil vapor-utilizing bacteria in the magnitude of 10(5) g(-1). Each phototrophic culture had its unique oil-utilizing bacteria; however, the bacterial composition in Leptolyngbya cultures from air and water was similar. The hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria were affiliated with Acinetobacter sp., Aeromonas caviae, Alcanivorax jadensis, Bacillus asahii, Bacillus pumilus, Marinobacter aquaeolei, Paenibacillus sp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The nonaxenic cultures, when used as inocula in batch cultures, attenuated crude oil in light and dark, and in the presence of antibiotics and absence of nitrogenous compounds. Aqueous and diethyl ether extracts from the phototrophic cultures enhanced the growth of the pertinent oil-utilizing bacteria in batch cultures, with oil vapor as a sole carbon source. It was concluded that the airborne microbial associations may be effective in bioremediating atmospheric hydrocarbon pollutants in situ. Like the aquatic and terrestrial habitats, the atmosphere contains dust-borne associations of phototrophic and heterotrophic hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria that are active in hydrocarbon attenuation.
TI  - Application of a continuously stirred tank bioreactor (CSTR) for bioremediation of hydrocarbon-rich industrial wastewater effluents.
AB  - A continuously stirred tank bioreactor (CSTR) was used to optimize feasible and reliable bioprocess system in order to treat hydrocarbon-rich industrial wastewaters. A successful bioremediation was developed by an efficient acclimatized microbial consortium. After an experimental period of 225 days, the process was shown to be highly efficient in decontaminating the wastewater. The performance of the bioaugmented reactor was demonstrated by the reduction of COD rates up to 95%. The residual total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) decreased from 320 mg TPH l(-1) to 8 mg TPH l(-1). Analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 26 hydrocarbons. The use of the mixed cultures demonstrated high degradation performance for hydrocarbons range n-alkanes (C10-C35). Six microbial isolates from the CSTR were characterized and species identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that 5 strains were closely related to Aeromonas punctata (Aeromonas caviae), Bacillus cereus, Ochrobactrum intermedium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Rhodococcus sp. The 6th isolate was affiliated to genera Achromobacter. Besides, the treated wastewater could be considered as non toxic according to the phytotoxicity test since the germination index of Lepidium sativum ranged between 57 and 95%. The treatment provided satisfactory results and presents a feasible technology for the treatment of hydrocarbon-rich wastewater from petrochemical industries and petroleum refineries.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and transglycosylation reaction of Paenibacillus sp. strain  W-61 xylanase 1.
AB  - A xylanase gene, xyn1, which encodes Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 1 (Xyn1), was cloned in Escherichia coli. xyn1 encodes 211 amino acid residues, including 28 amino acid residues of a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature Xyn1 showed 95.7%, 84.0%, and 83.7% identity to family 11 xylanases of Aeromonas caviae ME-1, Paenibacillus sp., and Bacillus stearothermophilus respectively. The physico-chemical properties of recombinant Xyn1 were very similar to those of intact Xyn1, except for the molecular mass. The pattern of xylooligosaccharides generated by rXyn1 was investigated by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). The degradation rate of xylohexaose by rXyn1 increased markedly as compared with that of xylopentaose. Xylohexaose had a single preferential point of cleavage by rXyn1. On the basis of the pattern of action of xylooligosaccharides, the number of subsites was estimated to be six. The catalytic site was located between the third and the fourth subsites from non-reducing end.
TI  - Use of a chiA probe for detection of chitinase genes in bacteria from the Chesapeake Bay(1).
AB  - PCR primers specific for the chiA gene were designed by alignment and selection of highly conserved regions of chiA sequences from Serratia marcescens, Alteromonas sp., Bacillus circulans and Aeromonas caviae. These primers were used to amplify a 225 bp fragment of the chiA gene from Vibrio harveyi to produce a chiA gene probe. The chiA PCR primers and probe were used to detect the presence of the chiA gene in an assemblage of 53 reference strains and gave consistent results. Selected chiA fragments amplified by PCR were cloned and sequenced from nine known strains and from Chesapeake Bay isolates 6d and 11d. This confirmed the specificity and utility of the primers for detection of chiA-positive environmental strains. Over 1000 bacterial isolates from Chesapeake Bay water samples were tested for the presence of the chiA gene which was found to be present in 5-41% (average 21%) of the culturable bacterial community. The approach developed in this study was valuable for isolation and enumeration of chiA-positive bacteria in environmental samples.
