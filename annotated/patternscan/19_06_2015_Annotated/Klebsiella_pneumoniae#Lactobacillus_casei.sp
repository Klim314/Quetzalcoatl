TI  == study of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus strains as probiotics on multi drug resistant (mdr) bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (utis).
AB  == objective(s): urinary tract infection (uti) caused by bacteria is one of the most frequent infections in human population. inappropriate use of antibiotics, often  leads to appearance of drug resistance in bacteria. however, use of probiotic bacteria has been suggested as a partial replacement. this study was aimed to assess the antagonistic effects of lactobacillus standard strains against bacteria isolated from uti infections. materials and methods: among 600 samples;  those with >/=10,000 cfu/ml were selected as uti positive samples. enterococcus sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli were found the most prevalent uti causative agents. all isolates were screened for multi drug resistance and subjected to the antimicrobial effects of three lactobacillus strains by using microplate technique and the mics amounts were determined. in order to verify the origin of antibiotic resistance of isolates, plasmid curing using ethidium bromide and acridine orange was carried out. results: no antagonistic activity in lactobacilli suspension was detected against test on enterococcus and enterobacter strains and k. pneumoniae, which were resistant to  most antibiotics. however, an inhibitory effect was observed for e. coli which were resistant to 8-9 antibiotics. in addition, l. casei was determined to be the most effective probiotic. results from replica plating suggested one of the plasmids could be related to the gene responsible for ampicillin resistance. conclusion: treatment of e. coli with probiotic suspension was not effective on inhibition of the plasmid carrying hypothetical ampicillin resistant gene. moreover, the plasmid profiles obtained from probiotic-treated isolates were identical to untreated isolates.

TI  == inhibitory activity of fermented milk with lactobacillus casei strain shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
AB  == objective: to determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with lactobacillus  casei strain shirota (fmlc) against common multi-drug-resistant (mdr) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. material and method: time-kill methods of fmlc and cell-free filtered fluid of fmlc (cf-fmlc) against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, esbl-producing escherichia coli & klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were conducted. the control solutions were mueller hinton broth (mhb) and distilled water. the mixtures of fmlc, cf-fmlc, mhb and dw with 10(5) to 10(6) cfu/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees c. each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. the inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees c for 24-48 hr. bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. results: log cfus of each organism in mhb and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11  at 24 hr. log cfus of each organism in fmlc and cf-fmlc after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. conclusion: fmlc and cf-fmlc exerted slow inhibitory activity against mdr  bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by lactobacillus  casei strain shirota. clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of fmlc can prevent and treat colonization and infection with mdr bacteria in hospitalized patients.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infection with lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus leichmannii. the literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus), but  the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. we describe a case of w.  confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. this procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. he subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition. he later developed an enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia. at the present admission, he had fever (t(max), 39.5 degrees c) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. blood cultures grew k. pneumoniae and w. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. a culture of the patient's hickman catheter tip was negative. the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. his condition improved, and he was discharged home, where he completed 4 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. lactobacillemia seldom results in mortality; however, it may be a marker of a serious underlying disease. it is usually seen in patients who have a complex medical history or in patients who receive multiple antibiotics. lactobacillus spp. are generally associated with polymicrobial infections, and when isolated from the blood, they need to be considered possible pathogens. the presence of a vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccobacilli on a blood culture should alert clinicians to the possibility of bacteremia caused by w. confusa or other small gram-positive rods.

TI  == genetics of l-sorbose transport and metabolism in lactobacillus casei.
AB  == genes encoding l-sorbose metabolism of lactobacillus casei atcc 393 have been identified on a 6.8-kb chromosomal dna fragment. sequence analysis revealed seven complete genes and a partial open reading frame transcribed as two units. the deduced amino acid sequences of the first transcriptional unit (sorre) showed high similarity to the transcriptional regulator and the l-sorbose-1-phosphate reductase of the sorbose (sor) operon from klebsiella pneumoniae. the other genes are transcribed as one unit (sorfabcdg) in opposite direction to sorre. the deduced peptide sequence of sorf showed homology with the d-sorbitol-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase encoded in the sor operon from k. pneumoniae and sorabcd to components of the mannose phosphotransferase system (pts) family but especially to domains eiia, eiib, eiic and eiid of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent l-sorbose pts from k. pneumoniae. finally, the deduced amino acid sequence of a truncated gene (sorg) located downstream of sord presented high similarity with ketose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases. results of studies on enzyme activities and transcriptional analysis revealed that the two gene clusters, sorre and sorfabcdg, are induced by l-sorbose and subject to catabolite repression by d-glucose. data indicating that the catabolite repression is mediated by components of the pts elements and by ccpa, are presented. results of sugar uptake assays in l. casei wild-type and sorbc mutant strains indicated that l-sorbose is taken up by l-sorbose-specific enzyme ii and that l. casei contains  an inducible d-fructose-specific pts. results of growth analysis of those strains and a man sorbc double mutant suggested that l-sorbose is probably also transported by the d-mannose pts. we also present evidence, from studies on a sorr mutant, suggesting that the sorr gene encodes a positive regulator of the two sor operons. sequence alignment of sorr, sorc (k. pneumoniae), and deor (bacillus subtilis) revealed that they might constitute a new group of transcriptional regulators.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  == in the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different gram-positive bacteria. it inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/ml which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. it functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. the antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against  both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.

TI  == distribution of an l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

TI  == [an electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  == transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei and edwardsiella tarda. different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. for the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses  by e. coli indigenous strains m-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. this observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.

TI  == the microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  == soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees c underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of ph from 6.5 to  4.5. lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter diversus and bacillus brevis, and the yeasts pichia burtonii, candida didensiae and rhodotorula rubra.  fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures  of these isolates showed l. casei, strep. faecium and staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the ph reduction. soybeans were the main source  of microorganisms for the fermentation. boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.

TI  == in vitro binding of potent mutagenic pyrolysates to intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the ability of 22 strains of intestinal bacteria to bind the mutagenic pyrolyzates--3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5h-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole [(trp-p-1) cas: 62450-06-0], 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido [4,3-b]indole [(trp-p-2) cas: 62450-07-1], 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(glu-p-1) cas: 67730-11-4], 2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(glu-p-2) cas: 67730-10-3], 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(iq) cas: 76180-96-6], 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(meiq) cas: 77094-11-2], and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [(meiqx) cas: 77500-04-0]--was investigated and compared to their ability to bind to some dietary fibers (corn bran, apple pulp, soy bean fiber, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan). the pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction  mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. trp-p-1 and trp-p-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. binding of trp-p-1 and trp-p-2 to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. none but corn bran bound glu-p-1 and glu-p-2 effectively. corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. the quantity of the binding of iq, meiq, and meiqx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. the mechanism of binding of trp-p-2 to freeze-dried feces, lactobacillus casei yit 9018 (lc9018), and corn bran was investigated. the binding was ph dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. these results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of trp-p-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. the mutagenicity of trp-p-2 for salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the presence of s9 mix was inhibited by the addition of lc9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. the results indicate that bound trp-p-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.

TI  == prevention of urinary tract infection in rats with an indigenous lactobacillus casei strain.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that indigenous bacteria are able to block the in vitro attachment of uropathogenic bacteria to human uroepithelial cells. in the present study, we applied the concept of competitive exclusion to an animal model. a chronic urinary tract infection was established in female rats with bacteria incorporated into agar beads injected periurethrally into the urinary bladder via a no. 3 french ureteral catheter. five strains of uropathogenic organisms were used in the first set of experiments, and their colonization of the bladder and kidneys of the animals was confirmed up to 2 months after injection. the uropathogens stimulated an immune response, detected by serum antibodies against the uropathogens, and an inflammatory response noted in sections of the kidneys stained with hematoxylin and eosin. using this animal model, we established the persistent adherence of bacteria in the urinary tract without the need for creation of obstruction or implantation of a foreign body. in a second set of experiments, an isolate of lactobacillus casei gr1 taken from  the urethra of a healthy woman was incorporated into agar beads, instilled within the rat bladders on day 1, and then swabbed twice weekly for 21 days onto the introitus before challenge with uropathogens instilled into the urinary bladder.  in 21 of 25 animals, no uropathogenic bacteria were recovered from the bladder and kidney tissues up to 60 days after challenge, and no immune response was detected. our results show that l. casei prevented onset of urinary tract infection in 84% of the animals tested. the lactobacilli appeared to exclude the  uropathogens from colonizing the urinary tract, within the first 48 hours after challenge, and the net effect was a complete eradication of bacteria from the uroepithelium. it is hoped that the demonstration of a protective role for indigenous bacteria in preventing urinary tract infection in an animal model will lead to the application of this technology to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in female patients.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == urease activity in the rumen of sheep and the isolation of ureolytic bacteria.
AB  == urease activity in the sheep rumen varied with the diet of the sheep, but appeared to be largely or entirely present in the small bacterial fraction. screening of over 1000 strains of rumen bacteria isolated on different media showed that urease activity was apparently confined to species of staphylococcus, lactobacillus casei var. casei and klebsiella aerogenes. consideration of the numbers in which these occurred and their activities suggested that the bacteria  could not be responsible for the total rumen urease activity. by enrichment culture a ureolytic strain of streptococcus faecium was isolated. this had a higher urease activity than the other bacteria and occurred in higher numbers in  the rumen. it could live with other bacteria in the rumen of a gnotobiotic lamb in numbers, and with a urease activity, comparable with those in the normal sheep rumen. the other properties of the bacterium also suggested that it would grow and produce urease in the rumen, but was unlikely to retain its urease activity after isolation. it was concluded that this bacterium was the main source of rumen urease in roughage-fed, and probably other, sheep.
