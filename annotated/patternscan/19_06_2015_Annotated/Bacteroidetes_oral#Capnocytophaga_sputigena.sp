TI  == high prevalence of beta-lactam and macrolide resistance genes in human oral capnocytophaga species.
AB  == objectives: to determine macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) resistance determinants in the capnocytophaga genus and to describe the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance genes in human oral capnocytophaga species. methods: forty-eight capnocytophaga isolates identified by analysis of 16s rrna sequences  were isolated from subgingival samples from 14 haematology patients (hps), 11 periodontitis patients (pps) and 17 healthy volunteers (hvs). mics of beta-lactam and mls antibiotics were obtained for all isolates. blacfxa, blacsp-1 (encoding a new class a beta-lactamase) and mls resistance genes [erm(f), erm(b), erm(q), erm(d), erm(c) and erm(a)] were evaluated using specific pcr and sequencing. results: in hvs, which had the lowest prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing isolates in comparison with the other groups (16%; p < 0.001), capnocytophaga ochracea was the prominent species (68%; p < 0.03). in pps, which had a high prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive isolates (82%; p < 0.001), capnocytophaga sputigena was more frequently identified (64%; p < 0.03). in hps, 50% of isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. the more rarely identified species (15%) capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga granulosa and capnocytophaga leadbetteri were isolated only from pps and/or hps. all beta-lactam-resistant isolates (44%) were pcr-positive for blacfxa (31%) or blacsp-1 (12.5%). interestingly, blacsp-1 was identified only in a subgroup of the c. sputigena species. twenty-nine percent of isolates were mls resistant independently of species identification, beta-lactamase production or patient group. the mls-resistant isolates carried the erm(f) or erm(c) gene (93% and 7%, respectively), previously unknown in the capnocytophaga genus. conclusions: our findings illustrate that capnocytophaga species are important contributors to the beta-lactam and mls resistance gene reservoir in the oral microbiome.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  == aim: to investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga sputigena. methodology: forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna-dna hybridization (micro-ident plus; hain lifescience, germany). results: extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for p. micra, f. nucleatum and c. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus c. rectus. significant association was recorded between f. nucleatum-endo and p. micra-endo  (p = 0.03, fisher's exact test). there was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) c. sputigena-endo and c. sputigena-perio (p = 0.06, fisher's exact test); (ii) p. micra-endo and p. micra-perio (p = 0.05, fisher's exact test). sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with p. micra-endo (p = 0.03, pearson chi-square test). conclusion: the findings suggest that f. nucleatum, p. micra and c. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == diversity of capnocytophaga species in children and description of capnocytophaga leadbetteri sp. nov. and capnocytophaga genospecies ahn8471.
AB  == bacteria of the genus capnocytophaga form part of the resident oral flora in children and adults. they are recognized as opportunistic pathogens of various extra-oral infections. the significance of individual species in periodontal and  extra-oral diseases is unclear, due to the inability of conventional phenotypic tests to identify clinical isolates to species level. aiming at a clear distinction between species, we undertook a phylogenetic study of a collection of 102 capnocytophaga strains including 62 oral isolates from children and 40 reference strains from oral and extra-oral infections representing the five known, human, oral capnocytophaga species. the phylogeny was estimated on the basis of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) of 12 intracellular, housekeeping enzymes and by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, and was compared to phenotypic characteristics. the clustering profiles in the mlee and sequence-based dendrograms were concordant and allowed identification of isolates to species level, based on co-clustering with reference strains. the study confirmed capnocytophaga ochracea and capnocytophaga sputigena as separate species, and underlined the problems of distinguishing between them by conventional phenotypic tests. the presence of two distinct clusters of oral isolates from children indicated the existence of novel species, supported by analysis of near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences and by dna-dna hybridization results. one cluster of weakly saccharolytic isolates without the ability to ferment sucrose is proposed as capnocytophaga leadbetteri sp. nov. (type strain ahn8855(t)=ccug 51857(t)=nctc 13375(t)). another cluster not phenotypically distinguishable from c. ochracea and c. sputigena is designated capnocytophaga genospecies ahn8471 (represented by strain ahn8471=ccug 51856=nctc 13374).

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == [in vitro sensitivity of oral gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal activity of defensins].
AB  == oral gram-negative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, provotella intermedius, provotella melaninogenicus, have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. an ultrasensitive antibacterial assay was applied to determine the sensitivity of a battery of oral gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated human neutrophil defensins (hnp) and two kinds of rabbit  defensins np1 and np2. all species tested were killed by hnp, np1 and np2 except  that porphyromonas gingivalis was resistant to hnp. however, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. it was concluded that the oral gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensinmediated bacterial killing.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == capnocytophaga granulosa and capnocytophaga haemolytica: novel species in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background: the oral cavity accommodates one of the most diverse microfloras in the human body. knowledge of this microflora, and of the periodontal microflora in particular, proves crucial towards an understanding of the bacterial-host interactions which lead to the development of infectious inflammatory periodontal diseases. capnocytophaga species have been implicated as putative periodontal pathogens. to date, only 3 members of this genus (c. gingivalis, c. ochracea and  c. sputigena) have been isolated from subgingival plaque. aim: this communication reports the isolation of 2 recently-speciated strains, namely c. granulosa and c. haemolytica, from subgingival plaque collected from adult periodontitis patients. material and methods: subgingival plaque was collected from 29 patients with chronic adult periodontitis. plaque samples were inoculated onto fastidious anaerobe agar and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. routine identification of clinical isolates was performed by 16s rrna pcr-rflp analysis, using cfo i as restriction enzyme and corroborated by 16s rrna gene sequencing. results: 16 of 29 patients (55%) tested positive for either c. granulosa and or c. haemolytica.  a total of 70 isolates (63 c. granulosa and 7 c. haemolytica) were cultivated from subgingival plaque. 15 (51%) patients tested positive for c. granulosa, and  3 (10%) patients tested positive for c. haemolytica. conclusion: this is the 1st  report which recounts the presence of c. granulosa and c. haemolytica in subgingival plaque. further research is required to establish the relative proportions of these species subgingivally in health and disease.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == pcr detection of capnocytophaga species in dental plaque samples from children aged 2 to 12 years.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of capnocytophaga sputigena, c. ochracea, and c. gingivalis in plaque samples from the toothbrushes of 122 children, using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. the subjects were 25, 85, and 12 children with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, ranging in age from 2-12 years old. plaque samples were collected from all erupted tooth sites using a sterile toothbrush. the mean amount of dna recovered from the samples was approximately 19.3 microg, which was deemed sufficient for performing a pcr-based survey. c. sputigena prevalence in healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis subjects was 48.0%, 36.5% and 25.0%, respectively,  that for c. ochracea was 100%, 89.4%, and 50.0%, respectively, and that for c. gingivalis was 96.0%, 84.7%, and 75.0%, respectively. the lowest age of positive  subjects was approximately 2 years. our results showed that c. sputigena was moderately prevalent, whereas c. ochracea and c. gingivalis were commonly detected in the oral cavities of the tested children, suggesting that all of these species become established in the early years.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == effect of three mouthrinses, containing amine/stannous fluoride, herbal extracts  or emser salt on the growth of oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == background/aims: clinical studies have shown the efficacy of mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation and inflammation of oral tissues. the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of three mouthrinses: meridol, an organic amine/ stannous fluoride solution; parodontax, containing herbal ingredients; and an 0.8 % emser salt solution, on the growth of oral bacteria and dental plaque. methods: growth of actinomyces viscosus t14v, capnocytophaga ochracea 25, c. sputigena 4, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) y4, and pooled supragingival plaque in the presence of the various mouthrinses, applied to paper discs, was tested in an agar diffusion test. in a second series of tests, the 4 bacterial strains were exposed to the agents for about 3 min to simulate rinsing, then the agent was removed, and the bacteria were inoculated into fresh nutrient  broth. after 48 h bacterial growth was measured in a spectrophotometer and compared with the controls. results: in the agar diffusion test only meridol, the organic amine/stannous fluoride-containing solution, could inhibit bacterial growth, except for a. a. y4. when the bacteria where in contact with the agents for only a few minutes these results were confirmed. neither paradontax nor emser salt inhibited the growth of the bacteria, and a. a. y4 proved to be resistant to all three agents. growth of the other three strains was inhibited by meridol 92-99% (undiluted), 85-96% (1:5) and 83-98% (1:10). conclusions: we conclude that only meridol contains ingredients capable of inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria in vitro. the efficacy of the other two mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation in vivo has to be explained by other mechanisms.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == second-trimester abortion caused by capnocytophaga sputigena: case report.
AB  == intra-amniotic infection is often the cause of a second-trimester abortion. the bacterial species involved include bacteria with low pathogenicity like ureaplasma urealyticum and various mycoplasma species. in this case we describe an intra-amniotic infection caused by capnocytophaga sputigena, often found in the normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity, but not in the vagina. oral sex during pregnancy was the most probable source of the infection. the aborted fetus showed signs of pneumonia upon histologic examination. the bacterial species was  identified using broad-spectrum 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) directly from the amniotic fluid and after bacterial culture. amniotic fluid glucose was below detection level, confirming the presence of an intra-amniotic infection.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == subgingival microflora and treatment in prepubertal periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia.
AB  == prepubertal periodontitis affects both primary and permanent dentition. the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival microflora of the permanent dentition in an 11-year-old caucasian female, who had premature exfoliation of her deciduous teeth on her 5th year of age, and the response of this condition to the antibiotic therapy and supportive periodontal care. gingival tissues were highly inflamed and alveolar bone loss was detected radiographically. the girl had experienced frequent upper respiratory tract infections, tonsilitis and recurrent otitis media. her mother had history of early onset periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. blood chemistry tests and immunological examinations were also performed. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the proximal sites of permanent molars, incisors, canines and maxillary premolars. 27 different microbial species were isolated from the subgingival microflora. among the predominant species were porphyromonas gingivalis (17.6%-7.3%), prevotella intermedia (12.4%-4.7%), capnocytophaga sputigena (14.4%-10.4%), capnocytophaga ochracea (13.2%-6.9%) and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.3%-5.5%). periodontal treatment consisted of scaling, root planing in conjunction with antibiotic administration of augmentin 312.5 mg and flagyl 200 mg, each t.i.d. for 10 days. 3 weeks after the  antibiotic therapy, bacterial samples were collected from the same sites. all the periodontal pathogens were recovered in lower levels and a.actinomycetemcomitans  was almost eliminated in the 3-week period. the evaluation of clinical indices at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that periodontal treatment in conjunction with antibiotics was effective and rapidly followed by marked clinical improvement. the microbiological monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after antibiotic treatment and each time prior to supportive periodontal care, revealed that the periodontal pathogens fluctuated in low levels even 12 months after treatment and could be maintained at low level by supportive periodontal care at 3-month intervals.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

AB  == serum igg responses to the cell envelope proteins (ceps) from capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga ochracea, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were examined in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects, both with and without type 1 diabetes (n = 60). serum igg responses to ceps were determined by immunoblotting  with biotin-goat anti-human igg and an alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin system.  reactivity was analyzed by transmission densitometry, digitization, and computer  manipulation. the patients with diabetes showed significantly (p < 0.01) fewer responses to 14 ceps (from 81 to 10 kda) from c. sputigena, 5 ceps (from 90 to 17 kda) from c. gingivalis, and the 27-kda cep from c. ochracea than in the non-diabetic group. the periodontitis patients showed significantly (p < 0.01) fewer responses to the 25- and 11-kda ceps from c. sputigena, the 125- and 17-kda ceps from c. gingivalis, and the 42-kda cep from c. ochracea than in the periodontally healthy group. hla-dr4, hla-dr53, and hla-dqw3 were associated with periodontitis, while only hla-dr4 was associated with diabetes (p < 0.02). significant (p < 0.01) correlations were found between hla-dr2 and igg reactivity patterns associated with non-diabetics, and between hla-dr4 and igg reactivity patterns associated with diabetic and periodontitis subjects. these results indicate that both type 1 diabetics and periodontitis subjects have a depressed igg antibody profile to capnocytophaga, which may account for an increased susceptibility to periodontitis infection. periodontitis in type 1 diabetes may be related more to the hla-d type and altered immune function than to the diabetes itself.

AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  == myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. there are three myeloperoxidase isoforms:  mpo i, mpo ii and mpo iii. we examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena and streptococcus sanguis. isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-a-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in mpo i and diminished in mpo iii. exceptionally, serum-opsonized a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests  based upon myeloperoxidase.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

AB  == vertebral osteomyelitis caused by capnocytophaga species was diagnosed in two adults. one of these infections was due to c. ochracea and the other was due to c. sputigena. both patients were immunocompetent and presented with concomitant periodontitis and gingivitis. the infections were eradicated by means of prolonged antibiotic therapy, combined in one case with surgical treatment. capnocytophaga species should be considered a potential cause of vertebral osteomyelitis in immunocompetent patients, especially in the presence of oral pathology.

TI  == novel fnr homologues identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, haemophilus aphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == based upon dna sequence data and positive immunochemical reactivity of expressed  protein, novel homologues of the fnr family were identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, haemophilus aphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the similarity to e. coli fnr and to hlyx (itself 71% similar to e. coli fnr, while regulating expression of hemolysin operon in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) was estimated from the deduced partial amino acid sequence to be, in the above order of tested species, 98, 98, 86, and 85%, and 75, 75, 88, and 88%, respectively. the phylogenetic relatedness indicates a rather closer link of hlyx to the fnr homologues from both pathogens, h. aphrophilus and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the possibility that the a. actinomycetemcomitans fnr homologue functions as a redox-sensing transcriptional  factor to regulate, in addition to anaerobic respiration, microaerobic expression of the leukotoxin operon (ltx gene) is suggested.

TI  == differentiation of human capnocytophaga species by multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis and serotyping of immunoglobulin a1 proteases.
AB  == as part of a larger taxonomic investigation of the genus capnocytophaga, 50 strains, including reference strains as well as clinical isolates, were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic (mlee) analysis of 12 intracellular metabolic enzymes and characterization of their immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases by enzyme-neutralizing antibodies raised in rabbits. the dendrogram derived from cluster analysis of the mlee data discriminated between the five known human capnocytophaga species and separated the strains into two major divisions. division a comprised c. gingivalis and c. granulosa strains, and division b comprised c. ochracea, c. sputigena and c. haemolytica strains. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease activity, a known feature of c. ochracea, c. sputigena and c. gingivalis, was present in all strains except the type strain of c. haemolytica and two clinical isolates. inhibition typing of iga1 proteases of  all active strains with enzyme-neutralizing antibodies against protease preparations of the type strains of c. ochracea, c. sputigena and c. gingivalis separated the strains into two major groups identical to the two divisions based  on the mlee data. thus, the iga1 proteases of c. granulosa and c. gingivalis seemed to be antigenically similar to one another, and different from the iga1 proteases of c. ochracea and c. sputigena, which had similar characteristics. the clustering of the clinical isolates based on the mlee analyses, which was confirmed by the antigenic characterization of iga1 proteases, was in good agreement with the results of previous studies.

TI  == [identification of capnocytophaga species by microplate hybridization method, and its restriction endonuclease digestion patterns].
AB  == because differentiation of capnocytophaga on a species level has been reportedly  proved impossible, we used a microplate hybridization method to identify three capnocytophaga species. photobiotin labeled dnas from clinical isolates were added to the wells of a microdilution plate in which reference dna had been immobilized. after 2 h of hybridization at 40 degrees c, hybridized dnas were quantitatively detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and the substrate, tetramethylbenzidine. of the 22 strains of capnocytophaga species, 6 strains were identified as c. sputigena, 8 strains as c. gingivalis, and 8 strains as c. ochracea. genomic dnas from 25 strains of capnocytophaga were treated with restriction endonuclease of hindiii, haeiii, and hinfi. nine strains of c. gingivalis showed no bands by the conventional electrophoresis of digested  dna. however, twelve strains (6 strains of c. sputigena and 6 strains of c. ochracea) revealed bands by the electrophoresis of hinfi-digested dna, and ten isolates had its own digestion patterns, indicating the presence of genetic variation. on the other hand, two strains of beta-lactamase-producing c. ochracea, one from blood and one from throat swabs obtained from a patient with acute leukemia, were classified as the same isolate by the identical digestion pattern and by the antimicrobial susceptibility test results, which strongly suggested that the oral lesion is the portal of entry into the blood.

TI  == an approach to efficacy screening of mouthrinses: studies on a group of french products (i). staining and antimicrobial properties in vitro.
AB  == there is a large and increasing number of oral hygiene products available to the  general public. as such, it is difficult to demonstrate efficacy for all in long-term home-use studies. the aim of this project was to determine whether screening studies could position the activity and efficacy of a number of antiseptic mouthrinses, available in france, by comparison with an established product. this study reports the experiments in vitro. the products under test were, 4 containing chlorhexidine (eludril, hibident, parodex and prexidine) with  hibident considered the positive control, one containing cetylpyridinium chloride (alodont) and one containing hexetidine (hextril). the 1st study determined the antibacterial profile of the chlorhexidine products against a panel of oral bacteria using an agar dilution method. the 2nd study recorded, by optical density, the propensity of all products to induce tea staining on clear acrylic specimens. the maximum inhibitory dilution (mid) of the chlorhexidine products against the test organisms, once adjusted for initial concentration differences,  were essentially similar. one exception was eludril which had an increased mid against capnocytophaga sputigena, an organism normally less sensitive to chlorhexidine. hibident and prexidine produced expected levels of tea staining; that produced by parodex was lower than the expected. staining by eludril was little different than water controls suggesting markedly reduced availability of  chlorhexidine in this product.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteremia by multidrug-resistant capnocytophaga sputigena.
AB  == a case of bacteremia caused by a multiresistant strain of capnocytophaga sputigena in a patient with hematological malignancy is described. the strain presented with a pattern of marked resistance to beta-lactams, with mics of > 256 mg/liter for ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, and cefuroxime, 64 mg/liter for cefotaxime, and 32 mg/liter for ceftazidime. in addition, the mic of ciprofloxacin was 16 mg/liter. both of these groups of antimicrobial agents are frequently used in the empiric treatment of infections in immunocompromised patients. the appearance of resistant strains suggests the need for antimicrobial susceptibility studies in all patients with severe infections caused by capnocytophaga spp. or other capnophilic organisms present in the oral microflora of these patients.

TI  == effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

TI  == bactericidal activities of synthetic human leukocyte cathepsin g-derived antibiotic peptides and congeners against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga sputigena.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. are gram-negative bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease (particularly in individuals with neutrophil defects) and life-threatening systemic infections. they are resistant to many antibiotics of microbial origin but are sensitive to the nonoxidative microbicidal action of neutrophils. these organisms are susceptible to the microbicidal effect of cathepsin g but are killed by two distinct mechanisms. the purpose of this study was to assess their sensitivity to the antibiotic effects of iiggr and hpqynqr, antimicrobial peptides derived from  human neutrophil cathepsin g. the efficacies of the synthetic peptides iiggr and  hpqynqr were tested by single-dose screening, dose-response, and kinetic assays against three representative strains (each) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. and one strain of eikenella corrodens. strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans were sensitive to iiggr and hpqynqr at equal concentrations (wt/vol), whereas strains of capnocytophaga and e. corrodens were more sensitive  to iiggr than to hpqynqr. these differential antibiotic effects occurred over both time and dose ranges too narrow to be of therapeutic significance but are consistent with the premise that cathepsin g kills these oral bacteria by two distinct mechanisms. except for ivggr, congeners of iiggr, including aiggr, iaggr, iiagr, iigar, iigga, iqggr, ilggr, and i-norleucyl-ggr (inlggr), were microbicidal at 500 micrograms/ml. iiggr-amide exhibited no antibiotic activity.  the d-enantiomer of iiggr, didiggdr, was as potent as iiggr itself. apqynqr exhibited antibiotic activity but somewhat less than hpqynqr. we conclude that charge distribution, but not chirality or net charge, is an important determinant in the antibiotic efficacy of iiggr. moreover, peptide antibiotics derived from cathepsin g may have therapeutic value against periodontal gram-negative, facultative bacteria.

TI  == capnocytophaga sputigena bacteremia associated with acute leukemia.
AB  == during a three-year period, capnocytophaga sputigena bacteremia occurred in three patients with acute leukemia receiving induction therapy on a hematology ward. oral pathology such as periodontitis or severe mucositis was considered to be the most likely source of bacteremia. all three blood culture isolates were identified as that species by deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) homology studies. because of the phenotypical similarity of capnocytophaga species, it is difficult to differentiate them by conventional bacteriological methods. all three isolates were susceptible to antibiotics active against most anaerobes. however, production of beta-lactamase was found in two isolates, one of which proved resistant to both piperacillin and ceftazidime. therefore, the empiric use of imipenem or clindamycin may be justified in febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer who develop significant oral lesions.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of the human neutrophil cytosolic s-100 protein complex, calprotectin, against capnocytophaga sputigena.
AB  == calprotectin is a complex of two anionic proteins found in abundance in the cytosol of neutrophils, certain macrophages, and oral epithelial keratinocytes. bacteria of the genus capnocytophaga are pathogens of periodontal origin which can cause systemic infection in neutropenic subjects. recently, it has been observed that capnocytophaga may be internalized by neutrophils within the cytosol rather than within a membrane-delimited phagosome. the purpose of this study was to test the in vitro antibacterial effect of the cytosolic complex, calprotectin, against capnocytophaga sputigena. calprotectin was purified from the cytosol of human neutrophils by gel filtration and anion exchange fplc, and it exerted potent in vitro antimicrobial effects against c. sputigena. net bacteriostatic activity was exerted up to 18 h, after which bactericidal effects  were observed. both net bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity occurred at concentrations above 20 micrograms/ml and exhibited identical dose-response characteristics. particle counts increased in the presence of calprotectin, despite net bacteriostasis as assessed by changes in colony-forming units (cfu).  dose-response characteristics and direct particle counts suggested that net bacteriostatic effects were the result of balanced cell division and death, rather than suspension of cell division. we conclude that calprotectin can be a significant contributor to host defense against infection by capnocytophaga.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == in vitro killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp.  by human neutrophil cathepsin g and elastase.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with that of capnocytophaga spp. by purified cathepsin g and elastase in vitro. both were sensitive to killing by purified cathepsin g, but only the capnocytophaga spp. were killed by elastase. killing by cathepsin g  exhibited logarithmic kinetics, was enhanced slightly by alkaline ph, and was enhanced greatly under hypotonic conditions. treatment of cathepsin g with diisopropyl fluorophosphate significantly reduced its bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga spp. but not against escherichia coli or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the bactericidal effects of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga sputigena and a. actinomycetemcomitans were inhibited by alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin but not  by bovine serum albumin. we conclude that (i) cathepsin g kills capnocytophaga spp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans, (ii) elastase kills capnocytophaga spp., (iii) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g is enzyme dependent against capnocytophaga spp. and enzyme independent against a. actinomycetemcomitans, and  (iv) natural plasma antiproteases may control both enzyme-dependent and enzyme-independent bactericidal activities of cathepsin g.

TI  == in vitro killing of oral capnocytophaga by granule fractions of human neutrophils is associated with cathepsin g activity.
AB  == the capnocytophaga are inhabitants of the hypoxic human gingival crevice that are normally prevented by neutrophils from causing periodontal and systemic infection. to identify potential nonoxidative bactericidal mechanisms against capnocytophaga within human neutrophils, gel filtration chromatography was used to fractionate neutrophil granule extracts. seven granule fractions, designated a through g, were obtained. the capnocytophaga were most sensitive to killing by fraction d. fraction d exhibited substantial bactericidal activity under aerobic  and anaerobic conditions. the bactericidal activity associated with ion-exchange  subfractions d8-d11, which contained primarily cathepsin g as assessed by enzymatic activity, amino acid composition, and nh2-terminal sequence. heat-inactivation, diisopropylfluorophosphate, pmsf, and n-benzyloxycarbonylglycylleucylphenylalanyl-chloromethyl ketone inhibited bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga sputigena but not escherichia coli.  we conclude that (a) human neutrophil cathepsin g is an important antimicrobial system against the capnocytophaga, (b) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga is oxygen independent, and (c) an intact enzyme active site is involved in the killing of c. sputigena but not e. coli. we suggest that  human neutrophil cathepsin g is an important antimicrobial system against certain oral bacteria and that cathepsin g kills bacteria by two distinct mechanisms.

TI  == the effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (igg) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  == the influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having  chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (cipd). the immunoglobulin g (igg) titers were determined by the microelisa technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, b. melaninogenicus, t. vincentii, and t. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. there was no consistent response to capnocytophaga. when individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. antibody levels to bacteria such as s. sanguis were modified during therapy. this would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.

TI  == sensitivity of capnocytophaga species to bactericidal properties of human serum.
AB  == capnocytophaga is a newly described genus of gram-negative bacteria which can cause serious oral and extraoral infections in the susceptible host. in the present study, sensitivity of capnocytophaga spp. to the bactericidal properties  of human serum was investigated. laboratory strains representative of capnocytophaga sputigena, c. ochracea, and c. gingivalis and seven oral isolates  of capnocytophaga spp. obtained in primary culture were determined to be sensitive to killing by pooled normal serum. in contrast, little or no killing of capnocytophaga spp. was observed when these organisms were incubated in the presence of hypogammaglobulinemic serum despite evidence for alternative pathway  activation. however, hypogammaglobulinemic serum could be reconstituted to bactericidal activity by the addition of the immunoglobulin m fraction of normal  serum. capnocytophaga spp. failed to activate the classical pathway in hypogammaglobulinemic serum, thus ruling out an antibody-independent mechanism of killing. in contrast, good correlation was observed between serum-mediated killing and antibody-dependent classical pathway consumption. these results indicate that complement in the presence of bactericidal antibody may be an important determinant of host resistance to intra- and extraoral infections caused by capnocytophaga spp.

"b. forsythus" reactions were similar but not identical to those of reference bacteroides species. positive reactions for alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and alpha-glucuronidase suggest that "b. forsythus" may be saccharolytic. it was the only species tested  which was trypsin positive. wolinella species, campylobacter concisus, b. gracilis, and eikenella corrodens are asaccharolytic, and characterization relies heavily on sensitivities to inhibitory agents. these species reacted weakly in the api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests, and the reactions were not useful for separating these species. the enzyme reactions differentiated wolinella recta and c. concisus from selenomonas sputigena, another oral motile but saccharolytic organism.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == ultrastructural studies of the effect of human leukocyte extracts on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == human gingival crevicular exudate (ge) and leukocyte extracts (le) were previously shown to be able to release the bulk of radioactivity from a variety of 14c-labeled oral bacteria. the present study demonstrates that the release of  radiolabel by these enzymatic agents from two periodontopathic bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4 and capnocytophaga sputigena strain 4) is accompanied by both cell wall and cytoplasmatic damage. the possible role of bacterial products released by lysosomal enzymes, present in the gingival crevice, is discussed.

TI  == ultrastructure of gliding bacteria: scanning electron microscopy of capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, and capnocytophaga ochracea.
AB  == when examined by both light and scanning electron microscopy, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. sputigena, and c. ochracea displayed three distinct growth zones:  the original streak, an intermediate zone, and the advancing edge, or halo zone.  on trypticase (bbl microbiology systems)-soy-blood agar, the cells translocated by gliding. c. gingivalis and c. sputigena formed large, irregular isolated colonies, while c. ochracea formed a more confluent cell mass. the cells within the streak zone and in most of the intermediate zone were heaped into mounds, with the individual cells displaying a definite flow pattern, the latter characteristic of c. sputigena and c. gingivalis. the halo zone consisted of tracks of cells which appeared to have translocated back upon themselves, or were restricted in their outward movements by adjacent cells. also present within the  halo zone were small aggregates of cells, referred to as pioneer colonies. the cell surfaces of c. gingivalis and c. ochracea were smooth and free of any apparent extracellular material, whereas c. sputigena was covered with a thick amorphous material, as well as long, thick, cell surface-associated fibrils.

TI  == fatty acid composition of gliding bacteria: oral isolates of capnocytophaga compared with sporocytophaga.
AB  == the extractable and bound lipids and cellular fatty acids of the gram-negative gliding bacteria, capnocytophaga sputigena, c. gingivalis, and c. ochracea were compared to the non-host-related gliding bacterium sporocytophaga myxococcoides.  the extractable lipids represented between 17 and 28% of the cell dry weight, whereas only 2 to 4% of the lipids were in the bound fraction. the methyl esters  of the cellular fatty acids were mainly ac15:0, which accounted for 69 to 73% of  the total extractable fatty acids; s. myxococcoides had a similar distribution of branched-chain fatty acids; however, ac17:0 was the predominant fatty acid in this free-living gliding organism.

TI  == capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. i. general characteristics, taxonomic considerations and significance.
AB  == the characteristics of gliding bacteria isolated from both healthy and diseased sites in the oral cavity are, summarized and the taxonomic position of the bacteria discussed. uniform attirubtes of the fusiform isolates include gliding motility, strictly fermentative metabolism dependent on the presence of co2 (or hco3-), under either anaerobic or aerobic conditions, presence of benzidine-reactive components, and the production of acetic and succinic acids as the major or sole, acidic, metabolic and products. given the guanine and cytosine content of dna, their gliding motility, and the ability of many strains to attack polysaccharide a relationship to the cytophagus is suggested. this relationship,  along with the co2-dependent growth is recognized by the generic name capnocytophaga given them. many of the isolates are grouped into three species c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, separated on the basis of morphological and physiological traits.

TI  == capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. iii. physiological characterization.
AB  == sixty-eight strains of capnophilic fusiform gram-negative rods from the human oral cavity were subjected to extensive physiologic characterization, tested for  susceptibility to various antibiotics, and the mol-percent guanine plus cytosine  of each isolate determined. the characteristics of the isolates were compared with 10 fresh and 2 stock isolates of fusobacterium nucleatum. the isolates clearly differed from the fusobacterium species on the basis of mol-percent guanine plus cytosine, end products, growth in a capnophilic environment and fermentation of carbohydrates. all of the gliding isolates required co2 and formed acetate and succinate, but not h2s, indole or acetylmethylcarbinol. all fermented glucose, sucrose, maltose and mannose. the organisms may be differentiated on the basis of fermentation of additional carbohydrates, hydrolysis of polymers and reduction nitrate. three species are proposed: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis.  ten isolates did not fit into the proposed species.
