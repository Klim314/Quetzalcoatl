TI  == periodontal disease in a remote asian population: association between clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  == objective: the aim was to clinically and microbiologically describe the periodontal conditions in a remote adult asian population with poor oral hygiene. methods: the subjects were 30-60-year-old adults of karen hill tribes with no access to dental care. eighty-six subjects were selected randomly. clinical registrations included number of remaining teeth, plaque index (pli), bleeding on probing (bop), clinical attachment loss (cal), and probing pocket depth (ppd). subgingival plaque samples were collected and analyzed with the checkerboard method. results: subjects of the study group had mean number of remaining teeth of 26.5 despite the abundant plaque and a high bleeding score. severe periodontitis (cal >/= 7 mm) was recorded in 12.9% of the youngest age group (30-39 years) while it was significantly higher (52%) in the middle group (40-49  years) and (60%) in the eldest age group (50-60 years). pathological pocketing (ppd >/= 7 mm) was significantly lower in all age groups. age, betel chewing, and a microbiological cluster including at least one of prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis and porphyromonas endodontalis significantly correlated with the severity of periodontal disease. conclusion: age, betel chewing, and a new bacterial complex other than the "red complex" correlated to periodontal breakdown in this remote adult asian population.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of porphyromonas endodontalis, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcr).  two different multiplex pcr protocols were used (one for the two porphyromonas species and the other for the three prevotella species), each one using a primer  pair specific for each target species. the results were compared to those of the  conventional culture procedures. microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a rapid id 32 a kit. multiplex pcr was processed using the dna extracted from each sample. at least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex pcr, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. multiplex pcr was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting bpb than the conventional culture procedures.

TI  == a new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aims: various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently  identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization method. methods: fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least  one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). one diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic  probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. results: twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than  healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). a significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, and eikenella corrodens). of the species in the new panel only prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis, and porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. conclusion: it was concluded that p. tannerae, f. alocis, and p. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.

TI  == geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. the purpose of this study was to use pcr to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in portland, oregon, and rio de janeiro, brazil. pcrs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene were used for detection of the bacteria after dna extraction from each clinical sample. statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in  detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, fusobacterium nucleatum,  and porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium necrophorum, and enterococcus faecalis. these results suggest that  differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.

TI  == pcr methodology as a valuable tool for identification of endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objectives: this paper reviews the principles of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  methodology, its application in identification of endodontic pathogens and the perspectives regarding the knowledge to be reached with the use of this highly sensitive, specific and accurate methodology as a microbial identification test.  data sources: studies published in the medical, dental and biological literature. study selection: evaluation of published epidemiological studies examining the endodontic microbiota through pcr methodology. conclusions: pcr technology has enabled the detection of bacterial species that are difficult or even impossible  to culture as well as cultivable bacterial strains showing a phenotypically divergent or convergent behaviour. moreover, pcr is more rapid, much more sensitive, and more accurate when compared with culture. its use in endodontics to investigate the microbiota associated with infected root canals has expanded the knowledge on the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases. for instance, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), treponema denticola, other treponema species, dialister pneumosintes, and prevotella tannerae were detected in infected root canals for the first time and  in high prevalence when using pcr analysis. the diversity of endodontic microbiota has been demonstrated by studies using pcr amplification, cloning and  sequencing of the pcr products. moreover, other fastidious bacterial species, such as porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis and some eubacterium spp., have been reported in endodontic infections at a higher prevalence than those reported by culture procedures.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.
