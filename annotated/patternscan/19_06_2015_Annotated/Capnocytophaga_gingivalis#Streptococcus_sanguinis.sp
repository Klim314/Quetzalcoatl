TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. ii. tooth position.
AB  == background and objective: little is known regarding the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. this study was designed to test  the hypothesis that tooth location affects the microbial composition of supragingival plaque beyond the effect due to plaque mass as reflected by total dna probe count. material and methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth in 187 subjects (n = 4745 samples). all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences in mean species counts and proportions were determined among tooth surfaces and six tooth type categories: molars, bicuspids, incisors/canines in the mandible and maxilla  separately using the kruskal-wallis test. stepwise multiple linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between species proportions and total dna probe count, tooth location, periodontal and smoking status, age and sex. results: all species differed significantly among tooth types and among the six tooth categories. higher plaque levels were seen on molars and lower incisors. some differences observed between tooth types could be partly explained by the level of plaque. teeth with high plaque mass exhibited high levels of capnocytophaga gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, campylobacter rectus and campylobacter showae. however, certain species, such as veillonella parvula and streptococcus sanguinis, differed significantly at different tooth locations despite similarities in plaque mass. twenty of the test species exhibited a significant association with tooth location after adjusting for total dna probe count and subject level factors. conclusion: while plaque mass was associated with differences in proportions of many species in supragingival biofilms, tooth location also was strongly associated with species proportions in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == severe, rapidly progressing peri-implantitis.
AB  == the replacement of teeth by means of titanium implants is a safe and predictable  procedure in most patients. some studies show that a small number of patients lose the majority of their implants. unfortunately, it is impossible to identify  these patients prior to surgery. it is important to report such cases so that we  may, in the future, be able to identify them before surgery. the present case showed a severe and rapid exfoliation of titanium implants. out of 8 implants inserted in the anterior lower jaw of this patient, only two maintained osseointegration over a 2-year period.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on maximum specific growth rates, biomass and hydrolytic enzyme production of streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga gingivalis in continuous culture.
AB  == dental plaque species, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga gingivalis, were  grown in continuous culture with progressively increasing concentrations of triclosan or its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate (tmp). for both organisms, the maximum specific growth rates decreased with increasing concentrations of triclosan or tmp until complete inhibition of growth occurred,  which for s. sanguis was at 20 mg/l and 50 mg/l, and for c. gingivalis was at 10  mg/l and 5 mg/l for triclosan and tmp respectively. for both species, biomass levels remained approximately constant or, in some cases, increased slightly at low levels of triclosan or tmp. however, biomass levels then decreased significantly as the triclosan or tmp concentrations approached lethal levels. for s. sanguis, levels of hydrolytic enzymes (acid phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and esterase) generally remained approximately constant or increased with increasing concentrations of triclosan or tmp until close to inhibitory levels where enzyme levels were reduced. the ratio of extracellular soluble enzymes to cell-bound enzymes remained constant or increased slightly with increasing levels of triclosan or tmp. for c. gingivalis, production of hydrolytic enzymes (neutral phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and trypsin-like  protease) remained constant or were reduced when grown with low levels of triclosan and tmp but in some cases increased with higher levels of agents. the proportion of extracellular soluble activity increased significantly when concentrations of agent neared inhibitory levels. the results taken together show that the physiology of cells is significantly altered and that hydrolytic enzymes are released from the cells when these are grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of triclosan or tmp. enzyme release is more pronounced in the gram-negative c. gingivalis and indicates that triclosan or tmp can cause membrane perturbation with subsequent release of membrane-located (s. sanguis) or periplasmic (c. gingivalis) hydrolytic enzymes. s. sanguis was more sensitive to  triclosan than tmp while c. gingivalis was more sensitive to tmp. this suggests that, in c. gingivalis, tmp may diffuse into the cell wall more easily than triclosan and then be converted to triclosan by phosphatase activity within the cell wall complex, where it may give rise to high localized concentrations and subsequent cell damage.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == short-term microbiological and clinical effects of subgingival irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse.
AB  == fifty chronic adult periodontitis patients completed a 6-week controlled, double-blind, split mouth clinical study to determine the effects of subgingival  irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse on periodontal microflora, supragingival plaque, and gingivitis when used as an adjunct to normal oral hygiene. qualifying subjects had at least four sites, two on each side of the mouth, with probing depths between 4 and 6 mm, which bled on gentle probing. following baseline examinations, subjects received a half mouth scaling and prophylaxis and full mouth subgingival irrigation with either the antimicrobial mouthrinse or sterile colored water control professionally delivered. subjects continued irrigation at home once daily for 42 days with their assigned rinse delivered via a subgingival delivery system. all sites in the mouth were scored at baseline and at day 42 for supragingival plaque, bleeding on probing, and redness. for the four selected periodontitis sites, probing depth and attachment  level were measured at baseline and on day 42; additionally, supragingival plaque and gingival redness were scored on days 7 and 21. subgingival plaque samples for microbiological analysis were harvested from the selected periodontal sites at baseline and on days 7, 21, and 42. microbiologically, irrigation with the antimicrobial mouthrinse resulted in statistically significant reductions compared to control in putative periodontopathogens, including black pigmenting species, which persisted at 42 days. clinically, subgingival irrigation with the  antimicrobial mouthrinse produced a significant reduction in supragingival plaque (p < 0.001), bleeding on probing (p = 0.019), and redness (p = 0.017) compared to the control, whether or not the area irrigated received a prophylaxis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == subgingival temperature (iii). relation to microbial counts.
AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [bacteriological examination of infections in the field of oral surgery].
AB  == etiology of bacterial infections in the field of oral surgery was studied. a total of 270 samples collected from patients with encapsulated abscess in their oral cavities was examined and bacteria were isolated from the 244 samples (90.4%). the following results were found; 1) organisms more than one from one sample were frequently isolated from cases with parodontitis, pericoronitis and gnathitis. isolation of anaerobic bacteria was common (54.2%). 2) streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga species were the most common isolates among aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. 3) peptostreptococcus micros and eubacterium lentum were most frequent isolates among gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. among gram-negative bacteria, oral group  bacteroides, especially bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oralis were most prominent. 4) isolation frequency of bacteria (both species and strains) was high from samples obtained from patients before antibiotic chemotherapy. 5) most strains were sensitive to midecamycin acetate and josamycin. minimum inhibitory concentration of 80% isolates (mic80) against these antibiotics was 0.39 microgram/ml.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at  the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less  than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three  other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  == the effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (igg) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  == the influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having  chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (cipd). the immunoglobulin g (igg) titers were determined by the microelisa technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, b. melaninogenicus, t. vincentii, and t. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. there was no consistent response to capnocytophaga. when individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. antibody levels to bacteria such as s. sanguis were modified during therapy. this would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
