TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == bacterial leakage in morse cone internal connection implants using different torque values: an in vitro study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to assess whether there was a decrease of bacterial leakage with increasing torque values in conical morse cone connection  implants. methods: a total of 30 morse cone conical tapered implants (10 implants per group) were used in this study. the abutments were connected to the implants  with 20 n (group 1), 30 n (group 2), and 40 n (group 3) insertion torque values.  the inner parts of 5 implants, per group, were inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa suspension and the remaining 5 implants, per group, with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the penetration of bacteria into the surrounding solution was determined by the observation of turbidity of the broth. results: in groups 1 and 2, bacterial contamination was found in 2 of the 10 implants, only in the specimens seeded with p. aeruginosa. in group 3, no contaminated samples were found. conclusion: this study demonstrated that with increased insertion torque values in morse cone connection, the bacterial leakage is reduced.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and dentin bonding strength of magnesium phosphate cements.
AB  == the main objective of this work was to assess the antimicrobial properties and the dentin-bonding strength of novel magnesium phosphate cements (mpc). three formulations of mpc, consisting of magnesium oxide and a phosphate salt, nh4h2po4, nah2po4 or a mixture of both, were evaluated. as a result of the setting reaction, mpc transformed into either struvite (mgnh4po4.6h2o) when nh4h2po4 was used or an amorphous magnesium sodium phosphate when nah2po4 was used. the mpc had appropriate setting times for hard tissue applications, high early compressive strengths and higher strength of bonding to dentin than commercial mineral trioxide aggregate cement. bacteriological studies were performed with fresh and aged cements against three bacterial strains, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa (planktonic and in biofilm) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. these bacteria have been associated with infected implants, as well as other frequent hard tissue related infections. extracts of different compositions of mpc had bactericidal or bacteriostatic properties against the three bacterial strains tested. this was associated mainly with a synergistic effect between the high osmolarity and alkaline ph of the mpc. these intrinsic antimicrobial properties make mpc preferential candidates for applications in dentistry, such as root fillers, pulp capping agents and cavity liners.

TI  == an in vitro investigation concerning the bacterial leakage at implants with internal hexagon and morse taper implant-abutment connections.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate, in vitro, the leakage observed in internal hexagon and morse taper implant-abutment connections. materials: ten specimens with internal  hexagon and 10 with cone morse connection were used. the inner parts of 5 implants, per group, were inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa (ps) suspension  and 5 implants, per group, with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa). the penetration of bacterial suspension into the surrounding solution was determined  by observation of turbidity of the broth. results: in the internal hexagon implants, bacterial contamination was found in 2 of 5 implant-abutment assemblies seeded with the ps, and in the assemblies seeded with aa, the contamination was found in 3 samples, with a total of leaked assemblies in this group in 5 of 10. in the cone morse implants, bacterial contamination was found in 2 of 5 implant-abutment assemblies seeded with the ps, whereas in the assemblies seeded  with aa, no contamination was found, with a total of leaked assemblies in 2 of 10. conclusion: the data support a not significantly higher permeability to bacterial leakage and a lower infiltration rate of screw-retained abutment connections when compared to cone morse taper internal connections.

TI  == implants with internal hexagon and conical implant-abutment connections: an in vitro study of the bacterial contamination.
AB  == prevention of microbial leakage at the implant-abutment junction is a major challenge for the construction of 2-stage implants in order to minimize inflammatory reactions and to maximize bone stability at the implant neck. the aim of the present in vitro study was an evaluation of the leakage observed over  a period of 28 days in cone morse taper internal connections and in screwed-abutments connections. in the present study 10 specimens of cone morse (group 1) and 10 of internal hexagon (group 2) implants were used. the inner parts of 5 implants per group were inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa (ps) suspension and 5 implants per group with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa). the possible penetration of bacterial suspension into the surrounding solution was determined by the observation of turbidity of the broth. in group 1, bacterial contamination was found in 3 out of 5 implant-abutment assemblies seeded with the ps and in 2 samples out of 5 in the assemblies seeded with aa, with a total of leaked assemblies in this group of 5 out of 10. in group 2, bacterial contamination was found in 4 out of 5 implant-abutment assemblies seeded with the ps, and in 4 out of 5 samples seeded with aa, with a total of leaked assemblies of 8 out of 10. the present data confirm the reported high permeability to bacterial leakage of screw-retained abutment connections, and the lower infiltration rates-although not significantly-of cone morse taper internal  connections.

TI  == bacterial leakage in implants with different implant-abutment connections: an in  vitro study.
AB  == background: two-piece implants present gaps and cavities between the implant and  the abutment, and these hollow spaces can act as a trap for bacteria. the aim of  the present in vitro study was to evaluate the migration of two different microbial species from the inside to the outside of the implant-abutment assembly in three different connection types. methods: a total of 30 implants (10 implants per group) were used. the implants presented a screwed trilobed connection (group 1), a cemented connection (group 2), and an internal conical connection (group 3). the inner parts of five implants, per group, were inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa suspension and the remaining five implants, per group, with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the penetration of bacteria into the surrounding solution was determined by the observation of turbidity of the broth. results: in group 1, bacterial contamination was found in six of 10 implants. in  group 2, no contaminated samples were found. in group 3, bacterial contamination  was found in one implant of 10. statistically significant differences were detected between group 1 versus group 3 (p <0.05) and between group 1 versus group 2 (p <0.01), whereas no significant differences were found when comparing group 2 versus group 3 (p >0.05). conclusion: the present study confirms previous results about the hermeticity of the cement-retained implant-abutment assembly, the very low permeability to bacteria of the conical implant-abutment connection, and the high prevalence of bacterial penetration of screw-retained implant-abutment assemblies.

TI  == modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  == inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. the present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. in particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori, bordetella pertussis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter rodentium, clostridium species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.

TI  == microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. methods: in a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an er:yag laser or an air-abrasive device. routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (pd) at  the implant. non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. results: pd  reductions (mean +/- sd) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and  air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). no baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. in the air-abrasive group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (p <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (p = 0.002), and fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (p = 0.002). both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (p <0.001). conclusions: at 1 month, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group,  and fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. clinical improvements were limited.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal  pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in  patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the  potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI  == measuring antimicrobial peptide activity on epithelial surfaces in cell culture.
AB  == to more accurately assess the activity and role of epithelial cell-derived antimicrobial peptides in their native settings, it is essential to perform assays at the surfaces under relevant conditions. in order to carry this out, we  utilize three-dimensional cultures of airway and gingival epithelium, which are grown at an air-liquid interface. under these conditions, the cultures can be subjected to challenge with a variety of factors known to cause an increase in antimicrobial peptide gene expression. the functional relevance of this induction can then be assessed by quantifying antibacterial activity either directly on the surface of the cells or using the fluid secreted onto the apical surface of the cultures. the relative contribution of the peptides can also be measured by pre-incubation of the secreted fluid with specific inhibitory antibodies. thus, a relatively inexpensive in vitro model can be used to evaluate the role of antimicrobial peptides in mucosal epithelium.

TI  == inhibitory effect of galectin-3 on the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans endotoxin in splenocytes derived from mice.
AB  == galectins, a family of animal lectins, are involved not only in development and differentiation but also in immunoregulation and host-pathogen interactions. galectin-3 interacts with lipopolysaccharides in gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella minnesota and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the present study investigated whether galectin-3 inhibited the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides using splenocytes derived from mice of different ages. lipopolysaccharides were extracted from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans y4 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and then purified. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) analysis revealed that galectin-3 adhered to a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides, but not to the lipopolysaccharides of p. gingivalis. splenocytes were prepared from 1- or 7-month-old c57bl/6 mice. either a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides (200 ng ml(-1)) alone or lipopolysaccharides and murine galectin-3 (10 microg ml(-1)) were added to culture solutions, and the release of interleukin-6 (il-6)  and interferon-gamma (ifngamma) from splenocytes was measured by elisa after a 17-h incubation. in all mice tested, a. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide  stimulation significantly increased the production of il-6 and ifngamma (p<0.01). murine galectin-3 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in the splenocytes of the 1-month-old mice (p<0.02 for il-6; p<0.05 for ifngamma), but not in the splenocytes of the 7-month-old mice. this suggests that responses  change with age.

TI  == crystal structure of the periplasmic component of a tripartite macrolide-specific efflux pump.
AB  == in gram-negative bacteria, type i protein secretion systems and tripartite drug efflux pumps have a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (mfp) as an essential component. mfps bridge the outer membrane factor and an inner membrane transporter, although the oligomeric state of mfps remains unclear. the most characterized mfp acra connects the outer membrane factor tolc and the resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux transporter acrb, which is a major multidrug efflux pump in escherichia coli. maca is the periplasmic mfp in the macab-tolc pump, where macb was characterized as a macrolide-specific atp-binding-cassette-type efflux transporter. here, we report the crystal structure of e. coli maca and the experimentally phased map of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans maca, which reveal a domain orientation of maca different from that of acra. notably, a hexameric assembly of maca was found in both crystals, exhibiting a funnel-like structure with a central channel and a conical mouth. the hexameric maca assembly was further confirmed by electron microscopy and functional studies in vitro and in vivo. the hexameric structure of maca provides insight into the oligomeric state in the functional complex of the drug  efflux pump and type i secretion system.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == design of bacteria-agglutinating peptides derived from parotid secretory protein, a member of the bactericidal/permeability increasing-like protein family.
AB  == parotid secretory protein (psp) (splunc2), a potential host-defense protein related to bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi), was used as a template to design antibacterial peptides. based on the structure of bpi, new psp peptides were designed and tested for antibacterial activity. the peptides did not exhibit significant bactericidal activity or inhibit growth but the peptide gl-13 induced bacterial matting, suggesting passive agglutination of bacteria. gl-13 was shown to agglutinate the gram negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa  and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, gram positive streptococcus gordonii and uncoated sheep erythrocytes. bacterial agglutination was time and dose-dependent and involved hydrophobic interactions. variant forms  of gl-13 revealed that agglutination also depended on the number of amine groups  on the peptide. gl-13 inhibited the adhesion of bacteria to plastic surfaces and  the peptide prevented the spread of p. aeruginosa infection in a lettuce leaf model, suggesting that gl-13 is active in vivo. moreover, gl-13-induced agglutination enhanced the phagocytosis of p. aeruginosa by raw 264.7 macrophage  cells. these results suggest that gl-13 represents a class of antimicrobial peptides, which do not directly kill bacteria but instead reduce bacterial adhesion and promote agglutination, leading to increased clearance by host phagocytic cells. such peptides may cause less bacterial resistance than traditional antibiotic peptides.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

AB  == introduction: the nobel direct implant (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) was developed to minimize marginal bone resorption and to result in "soft tissue integration" for an optimized aesthetic outcome. however, conflicting results have been presented in the literature. the aim of this present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of nobel direct implants. materials and methods: ten partially edentulous subjects without evidence of active periodontitis (mean age 55 years) received 12 nobel direct implants. implants were loaded with single crowns after a healing period of 3 to 6 months.  treatment outcomes were assessed at month 24. routine clinical assessments, intraoral radiographs, and microbiologic samplings were made. histologic analysis of one failing implant and chemical spectroscopy around three unused implants was performed. paired wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the evaluation of bone loss; otherwise, descriptive analysis was performed. results: implants were functionally loaded after 3 to 6 months. at 2 years, the mean bone loss of remaining implants was 2.0 mm (sd +/- 1.1 mm; range: 0.0-3.4 mm). three out of 12 implants with an early mean bone loss >3 mm were lost. the surviving implants showed increasing bone loss between 6 and 24 months (p = .028). only 3 out of the 12 implants were considered successful and showed bone loss of <1.7 mm after 2 years. high rates of pathogens, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tanerella forsythia, were found. chemical spectroscopy revealed, despite the normal signals from ti, o, and c, also peaks of p, f, s, n, and ca. a normal histologic image of osseointegration was observed in the apical part of the retrieved implant. conclusion: radiographic evidence and 25% implant failures are indications of a low success rate. high counts and prevalence of significant pathogens were found at surviving implants. although extensive bone loss had occurred in the coronal part, the apical portion of the implant showed some bone  to implant integration.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a gene encoding an immunosuppressive factor from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a pathogen of localized juvenile periodontitis and adult periodontitis. immunomodulating activity is generally thought to be important in colonization by such pathogenic bacteria. among the proteins possessing these activities, a 14 kda immunosuppressive factor of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been reported by kurita-ochiai and ochiai (infect immun 64: 50-54, 1996). to evaluate this factor, we cloned and characterized the gene encoding it. the immunosuppressive factor was screened from a genomic library of  a. actinomycetemcomitans using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino acid sequence of the factor. the clone obtained, phi13, contained a 1.5 kbp fragment.  the immunosuppressive factor located in its center. southern blot analysis showed that this factor is common among a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. the open reading frame consisted of 324 bp coding for 107 amino acid residues. the relative molecular mass of the deduced amino acid sequence was calculated to be 11,595. blast analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence is highly homologous with those of thioredoxins from haemophilus influenzae (76.6%), neisseria meningitidis (67.3%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (59.3%). these results suggest that the 14 kda immunosuppressive factor characterized in this study is a thioredoxin.

TI  == bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (bacteroides, gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., eikenella corrodens) and two control species (streptococcus intermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were  selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (pvp-i) aqueous solution in vitro. the pvp-i solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50,  100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. the strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous pvp-i for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.
