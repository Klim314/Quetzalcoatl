TI  == [possibility of the plasmid transfer within bacteria - compounds of the sulfidogenic microbial community].
AB  == extrachromosomal elements have been found within the isolates of ammonifying and  iron-reducing bacteria obtained from the natural sulfidogenic community. these elements were small with size approximately 5-9 kb. transconjugant strains pseudomonas aeruginosa 27, p aeruginosa 28, p mendocina 29, aeromonas hydrophila/caviae 30, harboured plasmids rp4 and r68.45 were obtained. the conjugation rate and retention of the plasmid within transconjugants were studied. p mendocina 29 cells with conjugation rate - 3.0*10(-6) cfu/ recipient cell, and p. aeruginosa 27 with rate 2.4*l0(-7) cfu/recipient cell were the most  susceptible to r68.45 plasmid. the most stable retention is shown for transconjugated strains such as p aeruginosa 27 (r68.45), p. aeruginosa 27(rp4),  p. mendocina 29(r68.45), a. hydrophila/caviae 30(rp4), a. hydrophila/caviae 30(r68.45). thus, it was experimentally shown that corrosive-relevant bacteria form sulfidogenic microbial community which is able to accept extrachromosomal genetic elements from other bacteria when they act as recipients in conjugational process.

TI  == characterization of aeromonas hydrophila wound pathotypes by comparative genomic  and functional analyses of virulence genes.
AB  == aeromonas hydrophila has increasingly been implicated as a virulent and antibiotic-resistant etiologic agent in various human diseases. in a previously published case report, we described a subject with a polymicrobial wound infection that included a persistent and aggressive strain of a. hydrophila (e1), as well as a more antibiotic-resistant strain of a. hydrophila (e2). to better understand the differences between pathogenic and environmental strains of a. hydrophila, we conducted comparative genomic and functional analyses of virulence-associated genes of these two wound isolates (e1 and e2), the environmental type strain a. hydrophila atcc 7966(t), and four other isolates belonging to a. aquariorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, and a. caviae. full-genome sequencing of strains e1 and e2 revealed extensive differences between the two and strain atcc 7966(t). the more persistent wound infection strain, e1, harbored coding sequences for a cytotoxic enterotoxin (act), a type 3 secretion system (t3ss), flagella, hemolysins, and a homolog of exotoxin a found  in pseudomonas aeruginosa. corresponding phenotypic analyses with a. hydrophila atcc 7966(t) and ssu as reference strains demonstrated the functionality of these virulence genes, with strain e1 displaying enhanced swimming and swarming motility, lateral flagella on electron microscopy, the presence of t3ss effector  aexu, and enhanced lethality in a mouse model of aeromonas infection. by combining sequence-based analysis and functional assays, we characterized an a. hydrophila pathotype, exemplified by strain e1, that exhibited increased virulence in a mouse model of infection, likely because of encapsulation, enhanced motility, toxin secretion, and cellular toxicity. importance: aeromonas  hydrophila is a common aquatic bacterium that has increasingly been implicated in serious human infections. while many determinants of virulence have been identified in aeromonas, rapid identification of pathogenic versus nonpathogenic  strains remains a challenge for this genus, as it is for other opportunistic pathogens. this paper demonstrates, by using whole-genome sequencing of clinical  aeromonas strains, followed by corresponding virulence assays, that comparative genomics can be used to identify a virulent subtype of a. hydrophila that is aggressive during human infection and more lethal in a mouse model of infection.  this aggressive pathotype contained genes for toxin production, toxin secretion,  and bacterial motility that likely enabled its pathogenicity. our results highlight the potential of whole-genome sequencing to transform microbial diagnostics; with further advances in rapid sequencing and annotation, genomic analysis will be able to provide timely information on the identities and virulence potential of clinically isolated microorganisms.

TI  == characterization and functional analyses of r-specific enoyl coenzyme a hydratases in polyhydroxyalkanoate-producing ralstonia eutropha.
AB  == a genome survey of polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha)-producing ralstonia eutropha h16 detected the presence of 16 orthologs of r-specific enoyl coenzyme a (enoyl-coa)  hydratase, among which three proteins shared high homologies with the enzyme specific to enoyl-coas of medium chain length encoded by phaj4 from pseudomonas aeruginosa (phaj4(pa)). the recombinant forms of the three proteins, termed phaj4a(re) to phaj4c(re), actually showed enoyl-coa hydratase activity with r specificity, and the catalytic efficiencies were elevated as the substrate chain  length increased from c(4) to c(8). phaj4a(re) and phaj4b(re) showed >10-fold-higher catalytic efficiency than phaj4c(re). the functions of the new phaj4 proteins were investigated using previously engineered r. eutropha strains  as host strains; these strains are capable of synthesizing poly((r)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(r)-3-hydroxyhexanoate) [p(3hb-co-3hhx)] from soybean oil. deletion of phaj4a(re) from the chromosome resulted in significant decrease of 3hhx composition in the accumulated copolyester, whereas no change was observed with deletion of phaj4b(re) or phaj4c(re), indicating that only phaj4a(re) was one of the major enzymes supplying the (r)-3hhx-coa monomer through beta-oxidation. introduction of phaj4a(re) or phaj4b(re) into the r. eutropha strains using a broad-host-range vector enhanced the 3hhx composition of the copolyesters, but the introduction of phaj4c(re) did not. the two genes were  then inserted into the pha operon on chromosome 1 of the engineered r. eutropha by homologous recombination. these modifications enabled the biosynthesis of p(3hb-co-3hhx) composed of a larger 3hhx fraction without a negative impact on cell growth and pha production on soybean oil, especially when phaj4a(re) or phaj4b(re) was tandemly introduced with phaj(ac) from aeromonas caviae.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa leaf extracts.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa  leaf extracts (moringa oleifera) on the growth of gram-positive and negative bacteria. methods: paper disks were soaked with 100, 200, 300 and 400 mul of extract at 20 g/180 ml and 10 g/190 ml. all extracts were tested against escherichia coli (atcc25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc25923), vibrio parahaemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis (atcc29212), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), salmonella enteritidis (ih) and aeromonas caviae. the susceptibility tests were performed using the modified disk diffusion method. results: the strains e. coli, p. aeruginosa and s. enteritidis (ih) were resistant to all treatments. in general, disks with 400 mul extract were the most efficient against s. aureus, v. parahaemolyticus, e. faecalis and a. caviae. conclusions: the study indicates a promising potential for aqueous and ethanolic moringa leaf  extracts as alternative treatment of infections caused by the tested strains.

TI  == [taxonomic position of certain representatives of sulphate-reducing corrosive microbial community].
AB  == sulfate-reducing bacteria and their heterotrophic satellites have been isolated from the biofilm formed on steel by sulfidogenic corrosive microbial community. bacteria were characterized according to phenotypical features and investigated by the methods of molecular-genetic analysis. in accordance with the phenotypical features the studied strain of sulfate-reducing bacteria were related to desulfovibrio genus, gram-positive strains of heterotrophic satellites were related to bacillus genus, b. firmus and b. subtilis species. gram-negative strains, as to their physiological-biochemical characteristics were related to pseudomonas genus, p. aeruginosa species, stenotrophomonas genus, s. maltophilia  species, and aeromonas genus, a. hydrophila/caviae species. taxonomic position of certain representatives of the community is confirmed by the molecular-genetic methods. a comparative analysis of the sequencing results has evidenced for the identity of sequences of 16s rrna of the studied bacteria with analogous sequence of strains from the genbank database. nucleotide sequence of strain 27 has a 99%  homology with the sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain 36 deposited at genbank to nucleotide sequence of bacillus subtilis. as to sulfate-reducing bacteria, only their belonging to desulfovibrio genus has been confirmed. thus the results of sequence-analysis of 16s rrna genes are in agreement with the data obtained from studying the phenotypical features.

TI  == aeromonas hydrophila folliculitis associated with an inflatable swimming pool: mimicking pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
AB  == aeromonas species are ubiquitous, facultative, anaerobic, gram-negative flagellated rods, mainly found in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. skin and soft-tissue infections, including cellulitis and wound infections, are the second most frequent location of isolations of aeromonas spp. in clinical samples, after the gastrointestinal tract. all three major aeromonas species (a. hydrophila, a.  caviae, and a. veroni biotype sobria) have been associated with wound infections, but a. hydrophila predominates. typically, infection occurs after trauma and subsequent exposure to contaminated fresh water or soil. however, aeromonas folliculitis has been rarely reported. we report the first two pediatric cases of aeromonas hydrophila folliculitis associated with the use of recreational water facilities that clinically and epidemiologically mimic pseudomonas folliculitis.  clinical and microbiological studies may be necessary to clarify the role of aeromonas spp. in this newly-reported infection.

TI  == [beta-lactamases of gram negative bacteria: never-ending clockwork!].
AB  == the acquired resistance against the wide-spectrum and highly stable beta-lactams  including third-generation cephalosporins (3gc) and carbapenems is constinuously  increasing and widespead with the discovery of various plasmid-encoded, or genes  cassette or integrons coding for a novel beta-lactamase, always a major mechanism of resistance. to explain resistance against 3gc, with the continuing story with  tem and shv mutated enzymes, several types of esbl (class a) emerge the ctx-m type, at least ctx-m-40, but also other non predominant types intitled bes, ges,  pla, per, veb. the wider resistance including 3gc, cephamycins and beta-lactamase inhibitor is correlated to synthesis of transferable cephalosporinases (class c)  usually located in the chromosome but mobilized from enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, hafnia alvei, morganella morganii, aeromonas caviae. such genes encoded the following types: acc-1, act-1, cfe-1, cmy group, dha-1, fox group, mir-1, mox-1. finally the resistance against carbapemens e.g. imipenem originally restricted to pseudomonas aeruginosa, then to acinetobacter baumannii  and finally to enterobacteria is related to production of novel enzymes (classes  b, d and a) denominated imp, vim sme, gim, oxa, kpc. a striking exemple of evolution towards more and more resistance is given by salmonella, even from animal origins, a great threat fo public health. so far it appears necessary to perform molecular approaches to identify such enzymatic production. finally because the absence of real new drugs, the discovery of some progenitors of the gene beta-lactamase, a strict control of beta-lactam antibiotics must be provide  not only in medecine or veterinary field but also in agriculture, including aquaculture for example.

TI  == complete type iii secretion system of a mesophilic aeromonas hydrophila strain.
AB  == we have investigated the existence and genetic organization of a functional type  iii secretion system (ttss) in a mesophilic aeromonas strain by initially using the aeromonas hydrophila strain ah-3. we report for the first time the complete ttss dna sequence of an aeromonas strain that comprises 35 genes organized in a similar disposition as that in pseudomonas aeruginosa. using several gene probes, we also determined the presence of a ttss in clinical or environmental strains of different aeromonas species: a. hydrophila, a. veronii, and a. caviae. by using one of the ttss genes (ascv), we were able to obtain a defined insertion mutant in strain ah-3 (ah-3ascv), which showed reduced toxicity and virulence in comparison with the wild-type strain. complementation of the mutant strain with a plasmid vector carrying ascv was fully able to restore the wild-type toxicity and virulence.

TI  == a secreted metallo protease from aeromonas hydrophila exhibits prothrombin activator activity.
AB  == detection, purification, and partial characterization of a protease from aeromonas hydrophila capable of cleaving prothrombin into active thrombin is described. the protease has been characterized with respect to enzymatic characteristics such as optimum reaction conditions for prothrombin activation, usage of additional substrates, as well as sensitivity against inhibitors. the protease activity can reversibly be inhibited by me2+ chelating agents like ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. the enzyme exhibits a pi value of 4.4 and can withstand temperatures up to 55 degrees c without loss of activity. with respect  to prothrombin the enzyme exhibits a k(m) value of 1.47 micromol/l and a vmax value of 1.66 mol/min per mol enzyme. amino terminal sequence analysis as well as mass spectrometry of fragments obtained by trypsin digest showed identity to a recently described elastase type protease from the same organism and homology to  known proteases from other procaryotes (e.g. aeromonas caviae, vibrio proteolytica, pseudomonas aeruginosa).

TI  == the genetics of glycosylation in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in reports of glycosylation of proteins in various gram-negative systems including neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, caulobacter crescentus, aeromonas caviae and helicobacter pylori. although  this growing list contains many important pathogens (reviewed by benz and schmidt [mol. microbiol. 45 (2002) 267-276]) and the glycosylations are found on proteins important in pathogenesis such as pili, adhesins and flagella the precise role(s) of the glycosylation of these proteins remains to be determined. furthermore, the details of the glycosylation biosynthetic process have not been determined in any of these systems. the definition of the precise role of glycosylation and the mechanism of biosynthesis will be facilitated by a detailed understanding of the  genes involved.

TI  == a secreted aminopeptidase of pseudomonas aeruginosa. identification, primary structure, and relationship to other aminopeptidases.
AB  == using leucine-p-nitroanilide (leu-pna) as a substrate, we demonstrated aminopeptidase activity in the culture filtrates of several pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the aminopeptidase was partially purified by deae-cellulose chromatography and found to be heat stable. the apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was approximately 56 kda; hence, it was designated ap(56). heating (70 degrees c) of the partially purified aminopeptidase preparations led to the conversion of ap(56) to a approximately 28-kda protein (ap(28)) that retained enzyme activity, a reaction that depended on elastase (lasb). the ph optimum for  leu-pna hydrolysis by ap(28) was 8.5. this activity was inhibited by zn chelators but not by inhibitors of serine- or thiol-proteases, suggesting that ap(28) is a  zn-dependent enzyme. of several amino acid p-nitroanilide derivatives examined, leu-pna was the preferred substrate. the sequences of the first 20 residues of ap(56) and ap(28) were determined. a search of the p. aeruginosa genomic data base revealed a perfect match of these sequences with positions 39-58 and 273-291, respectively, in a 536-amino acid residue open reading frame predicted to encode an aminopeptidase. a search for sequence similarities with other proteins revealed 52% identity with streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, approximately 35% identity with saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase y and a hypothetical aminopeptidase from bacillus subtilis, and 29-32% with aeromonas caviae, vibrio proteolyticus, and vibrio cholerae aminopeptidases. the residues potentially involved in zinc coordination were conserved in all these proteins. thus, p. aeruginosa aminopeptidase may belong to the same family (m28) of metalloproteases.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the extracellular metalloprotease of aeromonas caviae.
AB  == a gene (apk) encoding the extracellular protease of aeromonas caviae ae6 has been cloned and sequenced. for cloning the gene, the dna genomic library was screened  using skim milk lb agar. one clone harboring plasmid pkk3 was selected for sequencing. nucleotide sequencing of the 3.5 kb region of pkk3 revealed a single  open reading frame (orf) of 1,785 bp encoding 595 amino acids. the deduced polypeptide contained a putative 16-amino acid signal peptide followed by a large propeptide. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified recombinant protein (apk) was consistent with the dna sequence. this result suggested a mature protein of 412 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44 kda. however, the molecular mass of purified recombinant apk revealed 34 kda by sds-page, suggesting that further processing at the c-terminal region took place. the 2 motifs of zinc binding sites deduced are highly conserved in the apk as well as in other zinc metalloproteases including vibrio proteolyticus neutral protease, emp v from vibrio vulnificus, ha/p from vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase. proteolytic activity was inhibited by edta, zincov, 1,10-phenanthroline and tetraethylenepentamine while unaffected by the other inhibitors tested. the protease showed maximum activity at ph 7.0 and was inactivated by heating at 80 c for 15 min. these results together suggest that apk belongs to the thermolysin family of metalloendopeptidases.

TI  == molecular cloning of two (r)-specific enoyl-coa hydratase genes from pseudomonas  aeruginosa and their use for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis.
AB  == two pseudomonas aeruginosa genes, termed phaj1(pa) and phaj2(pa), homologous to the aeromonas caviae (r)-specific enoyl-coa hydratase gene (phaj(ac)) were cloned using a pcr technique to investigate the monomer-supplying ability for polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthesis from beta-oxidation cycle. two expression plasmids for phaj1(pa) and phaj2(pa) were constructed and introduced into escherichia coli dh5alpha strain. the recombinants harboring phaj1(pa) or phaj2(pa) showed high (r)-specific enoyl-coa hydratase activity with different substrate specificities, that is, specific for short chain-length enoyl-coa or medium chain-length enoyl-coa, respectively. in addition, co-expression of these  two hydratase genes with pha synthase gene in e. coli ls5218 resulted in the accumulation of pha up to 14-29 wt% of cell dry weight from dodecanoate as a sole carbon source. it has been suggested that phaj1(pa) and phaj2(pa) products have the monomer-supplying ability for pha synthesis from beta-oxidation cycle.

TI  == functional characterization of type iv pili expressed on diarrhea-associated isolates of aeromonas species.
AB  == our past work has shown that long, flexible type iv pili (single or in bundles) are the predominant pili expressed on fecal isolates of diarrhea-associated species of aeromonas (aeromonas veronii biovar sobria and a. caviae). they represent a family of type iv pili which we have designated bfp (for bundle-forming pili). reports from japan suggest that bfp are intestinal colonization factors. this study presents compelling evidence to support this conclusion. aeromonas bacteria and/or bfp purified from a strain of a. veronii biovar sobria were shown to adhere to epithelial and intestinal cell lines, freshly isolated human enterocytes, and fresh and fixed human and rabbit intestinal tissues, as determined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemical detection. removal of bfp by mechanical means decreased adhesion to cell lines by up to 80%. purified bfp blocked adhesion of the test strain to intestinal cells in a dose-dependent manner. adhesion was also blocked  by the fab fraction of anti-bfp immunoglobulin g. moreover, ultrastructural studies (ruthenium red staining and transmission and scanning electron microscopy) demonstrated for the first time that aeromonas adhesion to human enterocytes is pilus mediated and suggested that bfp may also promote colonization by forming bacterium-to-bacterium linkages. bfp-positive isolates examined for type iv pilus-mediated twitching motility in agar and slide culture  assays developed for pseudomonas aeruginosa did not, however, exhibit this function.

TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.

TI  == [post-traumatic endophthalmitis with multiple water pathogens].
AB  == history and signs: a 37-y-old worker for a recycling company suffered from a corneal perforation by a wire which had been in contact with dirt and moisture. therapy and outcome: initially, the typical signs of an endophthalmitis were missing so that we only irrigated and instilled antibiotics into the anterior chamber. however, later on two pars-plana vitrectomies became necessary. at each  operation a bacteriological examination was performed and we found four different species-pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella oxytoca, aeromonas caviae, flavobacterium odoratum. conclusion: the latter two species are very rare in ophthalmology. this fact and some peculiarities in the clinical course of the patient's disease make him an unusual case. after unsuccessful irrigation of the  anterior chamber vitrectomy ought to be performed immediately.
