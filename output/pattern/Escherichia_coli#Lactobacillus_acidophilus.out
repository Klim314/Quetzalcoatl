murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
the intestinal epithelial cell (iec) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. iecs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. however, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. the principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactobacillus on the upregulation of muc2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 attachment to epithelial cells. in the current study, the attachment of e. coli o157:h7 to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by l. acidophilus a4 and its cell extracts. it is also important to note that the expression of muc2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of l. acidophilus a4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which e. coli o157:h7 attached to epithelial cells. in addition, the mrna levels of il-8, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha in ht-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with l. acidophilus a4 extracts. these results indicate that muc2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of muc2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of e. coli o157:h7.
an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria. the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
preinoculation with the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine citrobacter rodentium colitis.
enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (a/e) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. the mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium causes a similar a/e lesion in the murine intestine. like epec, c. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. two-week old balb/c mice were inoculated with l. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before c. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to c. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. the probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. we observed that l. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits c. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in c. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity. probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), interleukin (il)-10]. preinoculation with l. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal iga secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6, and il-12]. these observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. this study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.
growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz. kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus. optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth. however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth. under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli. these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
inhibition of in vitro growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7 by probiotic lactobacillus strains due to production of lactic acid.
the inhibiting characteristics of lactic acid bacteria on shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 (three strains, clinically isolated) was investigated by using a batch fermentation system. the species such as lactobacillus casei strain shirota or l. acidophilus yit 0070 exert growth inhibitory and bactericidal activities on stec. the ph value and undissociated lactic acid (u-la) concentration of the culture medium of stec cocultured with l. casei or l. acidophilus dramatically lowered or increased, respectively [corrected], when compared with those of the control culture. the cytotoxic properties of u-la on stec strain 89020087 analyzed in vitro was divided into two phases, i.e., the bacteriostatic phase (between 3.2 to 62 mm) and the bactericidal phase (over 62 mm). these data suggest that the bactericidal effect of lactobacillus on stec depends on its lactic acid production and ph reductive effect.
immediate effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli in coculture.
the in vitro role of lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. a threefold concentrated cell-free extract from l. acidophilus sbt2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among the three strains of l. acidophilus, sbt2062, sbt2071, and sbt2074, only l. acidophilus sbt2074 showed this inhibitory property. these three strains were also tested in coculture with escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. the fermentation could result in complete inhibition of e. coli in 36 h. short-term administration of l. acidophilus sbt2074 in rats with and without e. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. the e. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. the fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when l. acidophilus sbt2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. the analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. the effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that l. acidophilus sbt2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801.
lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 produces a small bacteriocin, designated acidophilin 801, with an estimated molecular mass of less than 6.5 kda. it displays a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only related lactobacilli but including the gram-negative pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli row and salmonella panama 1467) with a bactericidal activity. the antimicrobial activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid was insensitive to catalase but sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, proteinase k and pronase, heat-stable (30 min at 121 degrees c), and maintained in a wide ph range. the proteinaceous compound was isolated from cell-free culture supernatant fluid and purified. crude bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellicle after ammonium sulphate precipitation (40% saturation) and partially purified by extraction/precipitation with chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). further purification to homogeneity was performed by reversed phase fast performance liquid chromatography. the amino acid composition was determined. amino acid sequencing revealed that the n-terminal end was blocked.
antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica. however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
lactobacillus acidophilus la 1 binds to cultured human intestinal cell lines and  inhibits cell attachment and cell invasion by enterovirulent bacteria.
four human lactobacillus acidophilus strains were tested for their ability to adhere onto human enterocyte like caco-2 cells in culture. the la 1 strain exhibited a high calcium independent adhesive property. this adhesion onto caco-2 cells required a proteinaceous adhesion promoting factor, which was present in the spent bacterial broth culture supernatant. la 1 strain also strongly bound to the mucus secreted by the homogeneous cultured human goblet cell line ht29-mtx. the inhibitory effect of la 1 organisms against caco-2 cell adhesion and cell invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. as a result, the following dose dependent inhibitions were obtained: (a) against the cell association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium; (b) against the cell invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium. incubations of l acidophilus la 1 before and together with enterovirulent e coli were more effective than incubation after infection by e coli.
adhering heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus, strain lb, inhibits the process of pathogenicity of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in cultured human intestinal cells.
heat-killed l. acidophilus, strain lb, was tested for its ability to adhere in vitro onto human enterocyte-like caco-2 and muco-secreting ht29-mtx cells in culture. the heat-killed lb bacteria exhibited a high adhesive property. a diffuse pattern of adhesion was observed to the undifferentiated cells, the apical brush border of the enterocytic cells, and to the mucus layer that covered the surface of the mucus-secreting cells. the inhibitory effect of heat-killed lb organisms against the human intestinal caco-2 cell-adhesion and cell-invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. the following dose-dependent inhibitions were obtained: (i) against the cell-association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely-adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium; (ii) against the cell-invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium.
inhibition of adhesion of enteroinvasive pathogens to human intestinal caco-2 cells by lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb decreases bacterial invasion.
salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were found to adhere to the brush border of differentiated human intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells in culture, whereas yersinia pseudotuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes adhered to the periphery of undifferentiated caco-2 cells. all these enterovirulent strains invaded the caco-2 cells. using a heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) which strongly adheres both to undifferentiated and differentiated caco-2 cells, we have studied inhibition of cell association with and invasion within caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria. living and heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb inhibited both cell association and invasion of caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. the mechanism of inhibition of both adhesion and invasion appears to be due to steric hindrance of human enterocytic pathogen receptors by whole-cell lactobacilli rather than to a specific blockade of receptors.
heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
impact of lactobacillus acidophilus on the normal intestinal microflora after administration of two antimicrobial agents.
twenty healthy volunteers participated in a comparative study concerning the influence of lactobacillus acidophilus supplements on the normal intestinal microflora after the administration of two antimicrobial agents, enoxacin and clindamycin, respectively. l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 was given as a fermented milk product containing 5 x 10(8)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml to ten of the volunteers immediately after the administration of the antimicrobial agents. on the seventh day of enoxacin administration enterobacteria were eliminated in nine of ten subjects. enterococci disappeared or decreased significantly in five subjects. during the l. acidophilus supplementation, there was a significant increase in the number of escherichia coli in one subject, while enterococci returned to the same level as before enoxacin administration in all subjects.
