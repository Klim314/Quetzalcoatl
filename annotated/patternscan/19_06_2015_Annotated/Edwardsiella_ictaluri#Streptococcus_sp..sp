TI  == development of a bacterial challenge test for gnotobiotic nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus larvae.
AB  == gastrointestinal microbiota have an important impact on fish health and disease,  stimulating interest in a better understanding of how these gastrointestinal microbial communities are composed and consequently affect host fitness. in this  respect, probiotic microorganisms have been extensively used in recent aquaculture production. to study the use of probiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases, the establishment of a method of experimental infection to obtain consistent results for mortality and infection in challenge tests is important. in pathogen-screening tests, 4 candidate pathogenic bacteria strains (edwardsiella ictaluri gly09, e. ictaluri gly10, e. tarda lmg2793 and streptococcus agalactiae lmg15977) were individually tested on xenic nile tilapia larvae. only edwardsiella strains delivered via artemia nauplii, with or without  additional pathogen delivery via the culture water, led to increased mortality in fish larvae. a gnotobiotic nile tilapia larvae model system was developed to provide a research tool to investigate the effects and modes-of-action of probiotics under controlled conditions. a double disinfection procedure using hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite solution was applied to the fish eggs,  which were subsequently incubated in a cocktail of antibiotic and antifungal agents. in the gnotobiotic challenge test, e. ictaluri gly09r was added to the model system via artemia nauplii and culture water, resulting in a significant mortality of the gnotobiotic fish larvae. the developed gnotobiotic nile tilapia  model can be used as a tool to extend understanding of the mechanisms involved in host-microbe interactions and to evaluate new methods of disease control.

TI  == isolation and identification of flavobacterium columnare and streptococcus iniae  antibacterial compounds from the terrestrial plant atraphaxis laetevirens.
AB  == columnaris disease, enteric septicemia of catfish, and streptococcosis are common bacterial diseases of certain freshwater fish and are caused by flavobacterium columnare , edwardsiella ictaluri , and streptococcus iniae , respectively. during the process of evaluating several species of plants to isolate and identify compounds with toxicity against these bacteria, a promising extract from the aerial parts of the terrestrial plant atraphaxis laetevirens (ledeb.) jaub. et spach (polygonaceae juss.) was selected for bioassay-guided fractionation using a rapid microplate bioassay. the active dichloromethane extract was subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning, and active fractions were further separated by normal-phase column chromatography and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). nepodin (3) and emodin (4) were isolated from two fractions with strong toxicities against s. iniae . a chloroform fraction was further separated by normal-phase column chromatography to yield two active fractions against f. columnare , and these fractions contained chrysophanol (1),  physcion (2), and nepodin (3). compound 1 had strong activity, and compound 3 had moderate activity against f. columnare , while compounds 2 and 4 were not toxic at the concentrations tested.

TI  == identification of bacillus strains for biological control of catfish pathogens.
AB  == bacillus strains isolated from soil or channel catfish intestine were screened for their antagonism against edwardsiella ictaluri and aeromonas hydrophila, the  causative agents of enteric septicemia of catfish (esc) and motile aeromonad septicaemia (mas), respectively. twenty one strains were selected and their antagonistic activity against other aquatic pathogens was also tested. each of the top 21 strains expressed antagonistic activity against multiple aquatic bacterial pathogens including edwardsiella tarda, streptococcus iniae, yersinia ruckeri, flavobacterium columnare, and/or the oomycete saprolegnia ferax. survival of the 21 bacillus strains in the intestine of catfish was determined as bacillus cfu/g of intestinal tissue of catfish after feeding bacillus spore-supplemented feed for seven days followed by normal feed for three days. five bacillus strains that showed good antimicrobial activity and intestinal survival were incorporated into feed in spore form at a dose of 8x10(7) cfu/g and fed to channel catfish for 14 days before they were challenged by e. ictaluri in  replicate. two bacillus subtilis strains conferred significant benefit in reducing catfish mortality (p<0.05). a similar challenge experiment conducted in  vietnam with four of the five bacillus strains also showed protective effects against e. ictaluri in striped catfish. safety of the four strains exhibiting the strongest biological control in vivo was also investigated in terms of whether the strains contain plasmids or express resistance to clinically important antibiotics. the bacillus strains identified from this study have good potential  to mediate disease control as probiotic feed additives for catfish aquaculture.

TI  == channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) protein disulphide isomerase, pdia6: molecular characterization and expression regulated by bacteria and virus inoculation.
AB  == protein disulfide isomerases (pdis) are thought to aid protein folding and assembly by catalyzing formation and shuffling of cysteine disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (er). currently, increasing evidence suggests pdis play an  important role in host cell invasion and they are relevant targets for the host immune response. however the roles of specific pdis in teleosts are little known. here, we characterized the protein disulfide isomerase family a, member 6 (pdia6) from channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus (named as ccpdia6). the catfish ccpdia6 gene was homologous to those of other vertebrate species with 13 exons and 12 introns. the consensus full-length ccpdia6 cdna contained an orf of 1320 bp encoding a putative protein of 439 amino acids. it had a 19 amino acid signal peptide and two active thioredoxin-like domains. sequence of phylogenic analysis  and multiple alignments showed that ccpdia6 was conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. southern blot analysis suggested the presence of one copy of the ccpdia6 gene in the catfish genome. tissue distribution shows that ccpdia6 was expressed in all examined tissues at the mrna level. when using the aquatic zoonotic pathogens such as edwardsiella tara, streptococcus iniae, and channel catfish reovirus ccrv to challenge channel catfish, ccpdia6 expression was significant changed in immune-related tissues such as head kidney, intestine, liver and spleen. the results suggested that ccpdia6 might play an important role in the immunity of channel catfish. this is the first report that the pdi gene may be involved in fish host defense against pathogen infection.

TI  == bacterial vaccines for fish--an update of the current situation worldwide.
AB  == during the last few years, the use of vaccines for disease prevention in aquaculture has expanded both with regard to the number of fish species and number of microbial diseases. according to the responses to a questionnaire received from 41 countries, vaccination is used in the commercial aquaculture of  species like atlantic salmon (salmo salar), rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss),  sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax), sea bream (sparus aurata), barramundi (lates calcarifer), tilapia (tilapia spp), turbot (scophthalmus maximus l.), yellowtail  (seriola quinqueradiata), purplish and gold-striped amberjack (seriola dumereli), striped jack (pseudocaranx dentex) and channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus). the range of bacterial infections for which vaccines are commercially available now comprises classical vibriosis (listonella anguillarum, vibrio ordalii), furunculosis (aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida), cold-water vibriosis (vibrio salmonicida), yersiniosis (yersinia ruckeri), pasteurellosis (photobacterium damselae supsp. piscicida), edwardsiellosis (edwardsiella ictaluri), winter ulcer (moritella viscosa), and streptococcosis/lactococcosis (streptococcus iniae, lactococcus garviae). furthermore, experimental vaccines are used against diseases such as infection with vibrio harveyi and photobacterium damsela subsp. damsela in barramundi, piscirickettsiosis and bacterial kidney disease in salmonids, as well as infection with flexibacter maritimus (now: tenacibaculum maritimum) in turbot. there was good agreement between the information received from different sources in the same country. most vaccines are licensed products, but some non-licensed vaccines are also used in commercial fish farms. most bacterial vaccines are inactivated products and recombinant vaccine technology has so far been used to a very limited extent. salmonid fish are usually immunised with multivalent vaccines by intraperitoneal  injection. in marine fish species vaccination is generally performed by immersion, but use of injection vaccination is increasing, particularly in the mediterranean region. only limited use of orally administered fish vaccines is reported. in general, the effect of vaccination against bacterial infections is good. the best protection is obtained with injectable, adjuvanted vaccines. however, injection-site adverse reactions often occur when such products are used.

TI  == rapid detection of columnaris disease in channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) with a new species-specific 16-s rrna gene-based pcr primer for flavobacterium columnare.
AB  == a 16-s rrna gene from the chromosomal dna of the fish-pathogenic bacterium flavobacterium columnare (formerly flexibacter columnaris), strain ars-i, was cloned, sequenced and used to design a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set. the primer set amplified a specific 1193-bp dna fragment from f. columnare strains but not from related bacteria, f. psychrophilum, f. aquatile, f. branchiophilum, or other bacterial pathogens of fish, flexibacter maritimus, cytophaga johnsonae, edwardsiella ictaluri, e. tarda, aeromonas hydrophila, and streptococcus iniae or from the non-fish pathogen escherichia coli. the pcr reaction conditions were optimized to permit detection of the organism from agar  plates, broth culture, frozen samples, dead fish tissue, and live fish in less than 5 h (8 h, if the more sensitive nested pcr is used). dna was extracted by a  boiled-extraction method or by commercial column purification. the pcr product was detected at dna concentrations below 0.1 ng and from as few as 100 bacterial  cells. nested pcr using universal eubacterial primers increased the sensitivity five-fold, allowing detection of f. columnare strains at dna concentrations below 0.05 ng and from as few as 10 bacterial cells in apparently healthy, asymptomatic fish. the efficiency of this primer set was compared to the 16-s rrna gene primer sets of toyama et al. [fish pathol. 29 (1994) 271.] and that of bader and shotts  [j. aquat. anim. health 10 (1998) 311.]. the new primer set is as good or better  than the previously published primer sets for detecting f. columnare in all samples and under all conditions tested.
