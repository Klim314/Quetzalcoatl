TI  - Microbiota-liberated host sugars facilitate post-antibiotic expansion of enteric  pathogens.
AB  - The human intestine, colonized by a dense community of resident microbes, is a frequent target of bacterial pathogens. Undisturbed, this intestinal microbiota provides protection from bacterial infections. Conversely, disruption of the microbiota with oral antibiotics often precedes the emergence of several enteric pathogens. How pathogens capitalize upon the failure of microbiota-afforded protection is largely unknown. Here we show that two antibiotic-associated pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and Clostridium difficile, use a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal carbohydrates during their expansion within the gut. S. typhimurium accesses fucose and sialic acid within the lumen of the gut in a microbiota-dependent manner, and genetic ablation of the respective catabolic pathways reduces its competitiveness in vivo. Similarly, C. difficile expansion is aided by microbiota-induced elevation of sialic acid levels in vivo. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with a sialidase-deficient mutant of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a model gut symbiont, reduces free sialic acid levels resulting in C. difficile downregulating its sialic acid catabolic pathway and exhibiting impaired expansion. These effects are reversed by exogenous dietary administration of free sialic acid. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment of conventional mice induces a spike in free sialic acid and mutants of both Salmonella and C. difficile that are unable to catabolize sialic acid exhibit impaired expansion. These data show that antibiotic-induced disruption of the resident microbiota and subsequent alteration in mucosal carbohydrate availability are exploited by these two distantly related enteric pathogens in a similar manner. This insight suggests new therapeutic approaches for preventing diseases caused by antibiotic-associated pathogens.
TI  - Both the unique and repeat regions of the Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutin A  are involved in adhesion and invasion of host cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major etiologic agents of adult periodontitis and has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. It expresses multiple hemagglutinins that are significant virulence factors and play an important role in bacterial attachment and invasion of host cells. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of P. gingivalis hemagglutinin A (HagA) on the attachment to and invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and gingival epithelial cells (GEC). Bacterial strains expressing the HagA protein (or subunits), including Escherichia coli carrying plasmid pEKS5, E. coli carrying plasmid ST2, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium with plasmid pNM1.1 were used in this study. The strains were tested for their ability to attach to and invade HCAEC and GEC using antibiotic protection assays. In addition, the unique 5' N-terminal non-repeated segment of HagA was purified in recombinant form and a monoclonal antibody was created against the polypeptide. The monoclonal antibody against the unique portion of HagA was tested for inhibitory activity in these assays. The attachment of both E. coli strains expressing HagA fragment to host cells was significantly increased compared to their respective controls. However, they did not invade GEC or HCAEC. Interestingly, HagA expression in the Salmonella strain increased both adherence to and invasion of HCAEC, which may be due to the presence of the entire hagA ORF. A monoclonal antibody against the unique 5' N-terminal portion of HagA reduced invasion. Further experiments are needed to determine the role of the unique and the repeat segments of P. gingivalis HagA.
TI  - Use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on growth performance and microbiota of weaned pigs during Salmonella infection.
AB  - Anaerobically fermented yeast products are a rich source of nutritional metabolites, mannanoligosaccharides, and beta-glucans that may optimize gut health and immunity, which can translate into better growth performance and a reduced risk of foodborne pathogens. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (Diamond V Original XPC) inclusion in nursery diets on pig performance and gastrointestinal microbial ecology before, during, and after an oral challenge with Salmonella. Pigs (n = 40) were weaned at 21 d of age, blocked by BW, and assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement consisting of diet (control or 0.2% XPC) and inoculation (sterile broth or Salmonella). Pigs were fed a 3-phase nursery diet (0 to 7 d, 7 to 21 d, and 21 to 35 d) with ad libitum access to water and feed. On d 14, pigs were orally inoculated with 10(9) cfu of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 or sterile broth. During d 17 to 20, all pigs were treated with a 5 mg/kg of BW intramuscular injection of ceftiofur-HCl. Growth performance and alterations in the gastrointestinal microbial ecology were measured during preinoculation (PRE; 0 to 14 d), sick (SCK; 14 to 21 d), and postinoculation (POST; 21 to 35 d). Body weight and ADG were measured weekly. Rectal temperature (RT) was measured weekly during PRE and POST, and every 12 h during SCK. Diet had no effect on BW, ADG, or RT during any period (P = 0.12 to 0.95). Inclusion of XPC tended (P < 0.10) to increase Salmonella shedding in feces during SCK. Consumption of XPC altered the composition of the gastrointestinal microbial community, resulting in increased (P < 0.05) populations of Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus after Salmonella infection. Pigs inoculated with Salmonella had decreased ADG and BW, and increased RT during SCK (P < 0.001). Furthermore, fecal Salmonella cfu (log(10)) was modestly correlated (P = 0.002) with BW (r = -0.22), ADFI (r = -0.27), ADG (r = -0.36), G:F (r = -0.18), and RT (r = 0.52) during SCK. After antibiotic administration, all Salmonella-infected pigs stopped shedding. During POST, an interaction between diet and inoculation (P = 0.009) on ADG indicated that pigs infected with Salmonella grew better when eating XPC than the control diet. The addition of XPC to the diets of weanling pigs resulted in greater compensatory BW gains after infection with Salmonella than in pigs fed conventional nursery diets. This increase in BW gain is likely associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Studies on the non-pathogenicity of Chryseobacterium proteolyticum and on the safety of the enzyme: protein-glutaminase.
AB  - Protein-glutaminase (PG) is a protein-deamidating enzyme produced from the microorganism Chryseobacterium proteolyticum strain 9670. Food safety studies were conducted on both the enzyme and the production organism. The strain was evaluated for pathogenicity and toxigenicity by intravenous and oral inoculation studies in Slc:ICR male SPF mice. The results demonstrate that the tested C. proteolyticum strain is of very low pathogenicity comparable to known food source bacterial strains and is very unlikely to demonstrate any pathogenicity in animals or humans. The level of endotoxin is very low and typical of the endotoxin levels in drinking water and teas. A 90-day study of PG, conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats, showed no adverse effects due to the enzyme up to dose levels of 2500 mg/kg-bw/day (NOAEL). Details of the study are presented, including, organ and body weights, histological findings, and blood and urine chemistry. Additionally, bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) and chromosomal aberration test using mammalian established cell line were conducted, resulting in the absence of mutagenicity in PG.
TI  - Expression of a Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin on the surface of a Salmonella vaccine vector.
AB  - Live, attenuated Salmonella strains can serve as vectors for the delivery of recombinant vaccine antigens for development of oral mucosal vaccines. Various vaccine parameters can affect the immune responses elicited by Salmonella vectors, including the expression level, location and timing of expressed antigens. We have previously established immunogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains which cytoplasmically express hemagglutinin B (HagB) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a putative periodontal pathogen. In this study, we sought to determine whether the 39 kDa HagB protein could be stably expressed on the surface of an avirulent Salmonella vaccine strain. The hagB gene was cloned into an expression plasmid as a C-terminal fusion with Lpp-OmpA, a hybrid surface display system. High expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB proved to be toxic to the vaccine strain, and it was necessary to introduce attenuating mutations in the trc promoter. Stable expression was obtained in transformants with promoter mutations that resulted in low levels of expression. The expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot. Localization to the outer membrane/periplasm was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy using immunogold labeling, surface labeling of whole mounts using electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and by quantitation of HagB in cytoplasmic, as well as inner and outer cell membrane fractions. When delivered orally in mice, the surface-expressing strain induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses to HagB than a cytoplasmic expressing strain, while responses in secretions were comparable. These results suggest that surface localization may differentially enhance the immunogenicity of antigens expressed by live, avirulent Salmonella vaccine vectors.
TI  - Chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria.
AB  - Motile bacteria often use sophisticated chemotaxis signaling systems to direct their movements. In general, bacterial chemotactic signal transduction pathways have three basic elements: (1) signal reception by bacterial chemoreceptors located on the membrane; (2) signal transduction to relay the signals from membrane receptors to the motor; and (3) signal adaptation to desensitize the initial signal input. The chemotaxis proteins involved in these signal transduction pathways have been identified and extensively studied, especially in the enterobacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Chemotaxis-guided bacterial movements enable bacteria to adapt better to their natural habitats via moving toward favorable conditions and away from hostile surroundings. A variety of oral microbes exhibits motility and chemotaxis, behaviors that may play important roles in bacterial survival and pathogenesis in the oral cavity.
TI  - L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide production of a murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell line stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine nitric oxide (NO) production of a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7 cells) when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (Pg-LPS). RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with i) various concentrations of Pg-LPS or Salmonella typhosa LPS (St-LPS), ii) Pg-LPS with or without L-arginine and/or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an arginine analog or iii) Pg-LPS and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with or without anti-IFN-gamma antibodies or interleukin-10 (IL-10). Tissue culture supernatants were assayed for NO levels after 24 h in culture. NO was not observed in tissue culture supernatants of RAW 264.7 cells following stimulation with Pg-LPS, but was observed after stimulation with St-LPS. Exogenous L-arginine restored the ability of Pg-LPS to induce NO production; however, the increase in NO levels of cells stimulated with Pg-LPS with exogenous L-arginine was abolished by NMMA. IFN-gamma induced independent NO production by Pg-LPS-stimulated macrophages and this stimulatory effect of IFN-gamma could be completely suppressed by anti-IFN-gamma antibodies and IL-10. These results suggest that Pg-LPS is able to stimulate NO production in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell model in an L-arginine-dependent mechanism which is itself independent of the action of IFN-gamma.
TI  - Interactions of Porphyromonas gingivalis with host cells: implications for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a contribution of periodontitis in atherosclerotic diseases. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such a connection involving general inflammatory responses and/or specific effects of periodontal bacteria on host tissues. METHODS: The role of the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis as a potential contributor to atherosclerosis has been investigated in model systems using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine J774 macrophage cell cultures. RESULTS: P. gingivalis 381 was demonstrated to induce foam cell formation in J774 macrophage cell cultures in the presence of low-density lipoproteins. The active bacterial component involved in this process appears to be lipopolysaccharide. This effect was not limited to these organisms as several other Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria exhibited the same property. In addition, in a more specific manner, P. gingivalis induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion in HUVEC cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The fimbriae of strain 381 are important, but are not required, for this inductive effect. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for P. gingivalis in several steps involved in atherosclerotic lesion formation.
TI  - Modulation of an interleukin-12 and gamma interferon synergistic feedback regulatory cycle of T-cell and monocyte cocultures by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in the absence or presence of cysteine proteinases.
AB  - Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is an efficient inducer and enhancer of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by both resting and activated T cells. There is evidence that human monocytes exposed to IFN-gamma have enhanced ability to produce IL-12 when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, it was demonstrated that LPS from the oral periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis stimulated monocytes primed with IFN-gamma to release IL-12, thereby enhancing IFN-gamma accumulation in T-cell populations. P. gingivalis LPS was shown to enhance IL-12 induction of IFN-gamma in T cells in a manner independent from TNF-alpha contribution. The levels of T-cell IL-12 receptors were not affected by P. gingivalis LPS and played only a minor role in the magnitude of the IFN-gamma response. These data suggest that LPS from P. gingivalis establishes an activation loop with IL-12 and IFN-gamma with potential to augment the production of inflammatory cytokines in relation to the immunopathology of periodontitis. We previously reported that the major cysteine proteinases (gingipains) copurifying with LPS in this organism were responsible for reduced IFN-gamma accumulation in the presence of IL-12. However, the addition of the gingipains in the presence of LPS resulted in partial restoration of the IFN-gamma levels. In the destructive periodontitis lesion, release of gingipains from the outer membrane (OM) of P. gingivalis could lead to the downregulation of Th1 responses, while gingipain associated with LPS in the OM or in OM vesicles released from the organism could have net stimulatory effects.
TI  - Environmental cues and gene expression in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Microorganisms typically adapt to environmental cues by turning on and off the expression of virulence genes which, in turn, allows for optimal growth and survival within different environmental niches. This adaptation strategy includes sensing and responding to changes in nutrients, pH, temperature, oxygen tension, redox potential, microbial flora, and osmolarity. For a bacterium to adhere to, penetrate, replicate in, and colonize host cells, it is critical that virulence genes are expressed during certain periods of the infection process. Thus, throughout the different stages of an infection, different sets of virulence factors are turned on and off in response to different environmental signals, allowing the bacterium to effectively adapt to its varying niche. In this review, we focus on the regulation of virulence gene expression in two pathogens which have been implicated as major etiological agents in adult and juvenile periodontal diseases: Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Understanding the mechanisms of virulence gene expression in response to the local environment of the host will provide crucial information in the development of effective treatments targeted at eradication of these periodontal disease pathogens.
TI  - Long-term immunological memory induced by recombinant oral Salmonella vaccine vectors.
AB  - We have previously shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing  the hagB hemagglutinin gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis can induce primary and recall immune responses in serum and secretions in mice; however, the longevity of memory induced by oral Salmonella carriers has not been adequately demonstrated. In this study, we examined the capacity of mice to mount a recall response 52 weeks after primary immunization. Recall responses were seen in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA following boosting at week 52, and in most cases, they were equal to or greater than the primary responses. Significant mucosal IgA recall responses in saliva and vaginal wash were also detected following boosting at week 52. In addition, there was a considerable residual response in secretions at week 51, prior to boosting. These results indicate that oral Salmonella vectors can induce long-term memory to recombinant HagB and are particularly effective at inducing long-lasting mucosal responses as well as at inducing the capacity for mucosal recall responses.
TI  - Effect of preexisting immunity to Salmonella on the immune response to recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing a Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin.
AB  - Recombinant Salmonella strains expressing foreign heterologous genes have been extensively studied as live oral vaccine delivery vectors. We have investigated the mucosal and systemic immune responses following oral immunization with a recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing the hemagglutinin HagB from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a suspected etiological agent of adult periodontal disease. We have previously shown a primary mucosal and systemic response following oral immunization with chi4072/pDMD1 and recall responses following boosting at 14 weeks after primary immunization. In this study, we examined the effects of earlier boosting as well as the effects of deliberately induced immunity to the Salmonella carrier strain on subsequent immune responses. Mice boosted at week 7 following immunization, a point which corresponded to the peak of the primary response, generally showed lower responses than those boosted at week 14. When mice were preimmunized with the Salmonella carrier alone and then immunized with the recombinant strain 7 or 14 weeks later, significant reductions were seen for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at week 14 and for salivary IgA at week 7. No reductions were seen in serum IgA or vaginal wash IgA antibodies. Mice appear to be refractory to boosting with orally administered salmonellae at 7 weeks. Deliberate immunization with the carrier strain did not appreciably affect recall responses at 14 weeks, with the exception of the serum IgG responses, nor did it affect colonization of the Peyer's patches.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence factors and invasion of cells of the cardiovascular system.
AB  - Our laboratory is interested in the genes and gene products involved in the interactions between Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and the host. These interactions may occur in either the periodontal tissues or other non-oral host tissues such as those of the cardiovascular system. We have previously reported the cloning of several genes encoding hemagglutinins, surface proteins that interact with the host tissues, and are investigating their roles in the disease process. Primary among these is HagA, a very large protein with multiple functional groups that have significant sequence homology to protease genes of this species. Preliminary evidence indicates that an avirulent Salmonella typhimurium strain containing hagA is virulent in mice. These data indicate that HagA may be a key virulence factor of Pg. Additionally, we are investigating the invasion of primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) by Pg because of the recent epidemiological studies indicating a correlation between periodontal disease (PD) and coronary heart disease (CHD). We found that some, but not all, strains of Pg are able to invade these cells. Scanning electron microsopy of the infected HCAEC demonstrated that the invading organisms initially attached to the host cell surface as aggregates and by a "pedestal"-like structure. By transmission electronmicroscopy it could be seen that internalized bacteria were present within multimembranous compartments localized with rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, invasion of the HCAEC by Pg resulted in an increase in the degradation of long-lived cellular proteins. These data indicate that Pg are present within autophagosomes and may use components of the autophagic pathway as a means to survive intracellularly. However, Pg presence within autophagosomes in KB cells could not be observed or detected. It is therefore likely that Pg uses different invasive mechanisms for different host cells. This and the role of HagA in invasion is currently being investigated further.
TI  - Expression and immunogenicity of hemagglutinin A from Porphyromonas gingivalis in an avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease that ultimately results in the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains as antigen delivery systems for protective antigens of pathogens that colonize or cross mucosal surfaces. In this study, we constructed and characterized a recombinant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium avirulent vaccine strain which expresses hemagglutinin A and carries no antibiotic resistance markers. HagA, a major virulence-associated surface protein, is a potentially useful immunogen that contains an antigenic epitope which, in humans, elicits an immune response that is protective against subsequent colonization by P. gingivalis. The hagA gene, including its promoter, was cloned into a balanced-lethal Salmonella vector and transferred to the vaccine strain. Heterologous expression of HagA was demonstrated in both Escherichia coli JM109 and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain chi4072. The HagA epitope was present in its native configuration as determined by immunochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Purified recombinant HagA was recognized by sera from mice immunized with the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain. The HagA-specific antigen of the vaccine was also found to be recognized by serum from a periodontal patient. This vaccine strain, which expresses the functional hemagglutinin protein, induces a humoral immune response against HagA and may be useful for developing a protective vaccine against periodontal diseases associated with P. gingivalis.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin: effect of boosting on mucosal, systemic and immunoglobulin G subclass response.
AB  - Live avirulent Salmonella typhimurium are convenient vaccine vectors for the delivery of recombinant antigens for the induction of mucosal and systemic immunity. The hagB gene encodes a hemagglutinin of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a suspected causal agent in human adult periodontal disease. In previous studies, we have shown that hagB can be expressed in avirulent S. typhimurium and is immunogenic when given orally to mice. In this study, we evaluated recall responses in both serum and mucosal secretions after boosting. In addition, we have examined the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass response in serum to both HagB and the Salmonella carrier. Mice were orally immunized with S. typhimurium expressing the hagB gene and then boosted 14 weeks later. Responses were measured through 27 weeks. Both primary and recall IgG and IgA responses were seen in serum to the purified HagB as well as to the Salmonella carrier. Likewise, mucosal primary and recall responses were seen in saliva, fecal extracts and vaginal washes although the kinetics of the responses differed. The anti-HagB response in serum was dominated by IgG2a during the peak of primary response, prior to boosting and during the peak of the recall response. The anti-S. typhimurium response shifted from predominantly IgG3 following primary immunization to IgG2a after boosting. The IgG1 response was minimal against each antigen. This pattern of IgG subclass distribution is consistent with a Th1-type response. These data indicate that avirulent S. typhimurium is capable of delivering a putative virulence factor from P. gingivalis and inducing a primary and recall response in both serum and secretions and provides a means of studying P. gingivalis virulence factors and for the development of a potential vaccine.
TI  - Chemical and biological properties of lipopolysaccharide from Selenomonas sputigena ATCC 33150.
AB  - Chemical and biological studies were performed on lipopolysaccharide isolated from Selenomonas sputigena ATCC 33150T, a possible causative agent of periodontal diseases. The sugar components of the lipopolysaccharide of S. sputigena were mannose, galactose, glucose, L-glycero-D-mannoheptose (heptose), 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonic acid, glucosamine and galactosamine in a molar ratio of 0.3:1.0:1.0:1.0:0.2:3.0:3.2 (mol/mol heptose). Sephadex G-50 chromatography of the polysaccharide portion of the lipopolysaccharide obtained by partial hydrolysis yielded three fractions: the O-polysaccharide chain attached to the core oligosaccharide, the core oligosaccharide and monosaccharides. Compositional analysis of these fractions revealed that lipopolysaccharide of S. sputigena carries a short O-polysaccharide chain consisting of galactose and glucosamine and that the core oligosaccharide consisted of glucose, heptose, glucosamine and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid. It is of particular interest that galactosamine was detected as a component sugar of the lipid A moiety in addition to glucosamine, which is a usual component sugar of the lipid A of most gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the lipid A of S. sputigena might have a unique backbone that differs from that of the lipid A of other gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A of S. sputigena consisted mainly of fatty acids such as undecanoic, tridecanoic, tridecenoic, 3-hydroxytridecanoic and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid in a molar ratio of 0.4:1.0:0.3:4.0:0.5 (mol/mol tridecanoic acid). Lipopolysaccharide and lipid A from S. sputigena both exhibited biological activity in activating the clotting enzyme of Limulus amebocytes, the Schwartzman reaction, mitogenicity for murine lymphocytes and in inducing interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-6 production in murine macrophages to the same extent as those observed for lipopolysaccharide of the Salmonella serovar typhimurium used as a positive control. The results suggested that the lipopolysaccharide of S. sputigena is a virulent factor in human periodontal diseases.
TI  - Contrasting effects of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) from oral black-pigmented bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae on platelets, a major source of serotonin, and on histamine-forming enzyme in mice.
AB  - By measurement of serotonin levels, the translocation of platelets to various tissues was examined following intravenous injection of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into C3H/HeN mice. There was a rapid platelet accumulation (within 5 min and particularly in the lung), followed by a slower accumulation in the liver, which reached its plateau 3-5 h later. The severity of the anaphylactoid shock corresponded well with the magnitude of the rapid response. LPSs from the oral black-pigmented bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, were much more potent in inducing the rapid platelet response than were those from the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. However, LPSs from these Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria in inducing the slow platelet response. There was also a contrast between their abilities to induce histidine decarboxylase, which forms histamine from histidine: LPSs from the Enterobacteriaceae were much more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria.
TI  - Expression and immunogenicity of a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin  in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  
TI  - Systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice orally immunized with avirulent Salmonella typhimurium expressing a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a variety of virulence factors that may have a  function in the periodontal disease process. Determination of the role of these various factors in pathogenesis and identification of a means for protecting the host from the destructive effects of this organism are areas of vigorous investigation. In this study we demonstrate the potential of avirulent Salmonella typhimurium strains to stimulate a specific systemic and mucosal immune response to a cloned P. gingivalis hemagglutinin (HagB). An avirulent strain of S. typhimurium, chi 4072, expressing the hagB gene of P. gingivalis 381 on the plasmid pDMD1 was intragastrically administered to BALB/c mice. These mice mounted a serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA primary response against the hagB gene product and a mucosal immune response as measured by evaluation of saliva. IgA antibodies were also detected in bile. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using attenuated S. typhimurium strains as carriers of P. gingivalis virulence factors for subsequent evaluation of the systemic and mucosal immune response against these antigens. This system will provide a means for evaluating the virulence factors of P. gingivalis for their suitability in the construction of potential vaccines.
TI  - Longitudinal evaluation of peripheral blood monocyte secretory function in periodontitis-resistant and periodontitis-susceptible patients.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocyte secretory responses longitudinally in patients with generalized severe chronic adult periodontitis (periodontitis-susceptible) and controls with gingivitis (periodontitis-resistant). In addition, the expression of constitutive (Leu-M3) and LPS-inducible (Mo3e) antigens on monocytes isolated from these two groups was examined. Monocyte secretory function was assessed longitudinally; the effect of periodontal therapy in the susceptible patients was examined by comparing monocyte function before and after their treatment. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation and treated with control medium or media containing 1 microgram/ml of Salmonella typhimurium LPS or Prevotella intermedia LPS with or without human recombinant interferon (IFN)-gamma pretreatment. Prostaglandin E2, F2 alpha and thromboxane B2 were quantified in culture samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and interleukin-1 beta was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Leu-M3 and Mo3e antigen expression was assessed by FACScan. Three major findings were made. First, LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta release by monocytes from susceptible patients was depressed relative to that in resistant patients at the initial donation. After periodontal therapy, there was virtually identical IL-1 beta release in LPS-stimulated cultures from both groups. However, in susceptible patients IL-beta release was diminished after periodontal therapy in cultures pretreated with IFN-gamma. Second, there was a significant drift in monocyte secretion of prostaglandin E2 in samples from the resistant patients between the first two donations and the third donation. PGE2 release did not differ between groups at the initial donation, although there was a depression in PGE2 release in the susceptible group at the final donation when IFN-gamma was followed by S. typhimurium LPS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin from an avirulent strain of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Identification of surface macromolecules of Porphyromonas gingivalis that act as  virulence factors in periodontal disease has important implications for studying host-parasite interactions as well as for potential vaccine development. The objective of this study was to determine whether a cloned, P. gingivalis hemagglutinin gene could be expressed in an intact form in an avirulent Salmonella typhimurium vaccine construct and to characterize the recombinant protein. The recombinant protein was purified from the vaccine strain, characterized, and tested for biological activity as a competitive inhibitor of hemagglutination. Cells of S. typhimurium SL3261/pST7 grown in Luria broth were broken by sonic disruption and fractionated. The purified recombinant protein was found to inhibit hemagglutination of erythrocytes by whole P. gingivalis cells. The same purified protein was analyzed for its N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition and found to match that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene. These results indicate that a surface macromolecule of P. gingivalis can be expressed in an intact and biologically active form in a Salmonella carrier strain.
TI  - Correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  - Infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. In-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the MIC and tissue levels generally above the MIC at time of challenge and during the course of infection. The efficacy of azithromycin against a Salmonella enteritidis oral challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. The significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. Ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). In another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized Staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. Extravascular fluid levels of azithromycin were greater than the MIC of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the MIC at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. Serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the MIC at the time of challenge. The antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of Staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, P less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. The significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with Escherichia coli or a mixture of Staph. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Kinin generation in the gingival inflammatory response to topically applied bacterial lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - A water-soluble lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella enteritidis and a phenol-soluble lipopolysaccharide from Leptotrichia buccalis were applied topically to the healthy marginal gingivae of beagle dogs. Saline was applied to contralateral areas as an internal control. Increases in vascular permeability were monitored by measurement of gingival fluid, and the collected gingival fluid samples were assayed for kininogenase and kinin activities. Both lipopolysaccharides induced an inflammatory response, as indicated by increased gingival fluid flow. Kininogenase-kinin activities paralleled the increases in gingival fluid flow, with the highest values being associated with peak increases in gingival fluid. The results indicate that both lipopolysaccharides, although different in lipid solubility, penetrate healthy sulcular epithelium and initiate an inflammatory response which is mediated in part by the kallikrein-kinin system. Interrelationships between this system and other inflammatory mediators suggest that kinin generation not only plays a role in the early phases of acute gingival inflammation, but may also contribute to the activation of other mediators appearing later in the response and in chronic inflammatory lesions.
TI  - The bone-resorbing activities in tissue culture of lipopolysaccharides from the bacteria Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis and Capnocytophaga ochracea isolated from human mouths.
AB  - The activities of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were assessed by measuring the calcium release from mouse calvaria in vitro and compared to that of LPS from Salmonella typhimurium. Stimulation of bone resorption was maximal at an LPS concentration of 10 micrograms/ml and at this dose all oral LPS preparations showed similar levels of activity and less than that of LPS from S. typhimurium. Only S. typhimurium LPS and B. gingivalis LPS retained bone-resorbing activity at 0.1 microgram/ml. No bone-resorbing activity was observed against killed bone and histochemical observations of stable acid phosphatase activity indicated both mononuclear and multinuclear cells participating in bone removal. Addition of indomethacin to the culture medium did not inhibit calcium release from the bones by any of the LPS preparations except for that from A. actinomycetemcomitans. Fetal calf serum completely blocked the activities of all the LPS preparations whereas human serum did not inhibit the action of B. gingivalis LPS. Thus this particular LPS could be important in mediating bone loss in chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Various lipopolysaccharides reduce adhesion of periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  - The interaction of LPS from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and lipid A from S. typhimurium with adhesion of human periodontal cells on plastic surfaces has been studied. The results showed that LPS and lipid A reduced adhesion already after 5 min at concentrations from 5 to 200 microgram/ml without influencing cell viability. It could be demonstrated that LPS and lipid A interact with both the cell and the substratum surface. Lipid A from S. typhimurium was more potent than any of the LPS used.
