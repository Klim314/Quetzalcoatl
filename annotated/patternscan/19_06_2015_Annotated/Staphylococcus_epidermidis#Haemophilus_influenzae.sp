TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == limitations of current antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  == bacterial conjunctivitis is a common ocular infection that is generally treated empirically with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. the more common pathogens causing bacterial conjunctivitis include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and moraxella species. several antibiotics traditionally used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis are no longer widely prescribed because of increased bacterial resistance and/or safety  concerns. the introduction of the fluoroquinolone class of anti-infectives offered effective and better tolerated treatment options. nonetheless, successful therapy for bacterial conjunctivitis continues to be limited by several factors.  a primary concern is the development of bacterial resistance that may be impacted not only by widespread antibiotic use but also by antibacterial pharmacokinetics, such as maintenance of insufficient bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection. in addition, poor adherence to prescribed regimens that require frequent administration, along with undesirable adverse events, affects the development of bacterial resistance and the success of treatment regimens. this article reviews current antibacterial agents used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, factors that limit their successful use in treatment, and options for future development of more effective topical ophthalmic anti-infective agents.

AB  == background: conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. objectives: the objective was to define the limit of detection (lod), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. methods: a pcr algorithm consisting of initial broad-based  detection of eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. the 16s rrna gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. pathogen-specific probes were designed for streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli,  and listeria monocytogenes. gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. the lod and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. a total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (csf) clinical samples obtained from the johns hopkins hospital (jhh) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. results: the lod of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. time to detection was 3 hours. in clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or gram-typing probes. adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% ci = 65.3% to 98.6%). the universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. conclusions: a broad-based multiprobe pcr assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise  in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [bacteriology of occluded nasolacrimal ducts in infants].
AB  == background: connatal lacrimal duct stenosis (cldo) commonly causes purulent bacterial dacyrocystitis. the recommended treatment of choice is up to the sixth  month of life a conservative antimicrobiological therapy. after the sixth month lacrimal duct irrigation with silicone tube intubation remains the gold standard. our purpose was to analyse the current bacterial spectrum in cldo and to compile  a bacterial resistogram in order to specify antimicrobiological therapy. methods: 66 samples from the lacrimal duct of 6- to 16-month-old children (41 female, 25 male) were obtained by collecting the refluxing liquids with cotton wool swabs after irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system with sterile saline during lacrimal duct surgery. cultures were incubated aerobically and anaerobically and  the infectious agents were isolated. sensitivity testing was performed for each isolate, testing 8 different commonly used local antibiotics. data were statistically analysed using spss. results: cultures were positive in cldo in 97  %, showing co-colonisation in 87 % with up to five bacterial strains. gram-positive bacteria were seen in 72 % of the isolates in cldo with streptococcus pneumoniae (31 %) being the most abundant strain, followed by staphylococcus aureus (13 %) and s. epidermidis (13 %). in 85 % of the samples at least one gram-negative rod was present, most often branhamella (12 %), followed  by haemophilus influenzae (11 %). sensitivity testing revealed chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin to be the most effective drugs in cldo, whereas erythromycin and gentamycin turned out to be insufficient in treating cldo. conclusion: bacterial colonisation plays a crucial role in cldo, showing a positive culture in 97 % with frequent co-colonisation of several bacterial strains (often in combination with at least one gram-negative strain).  the sampling of a microbiological probe of the lacrimal duct is recommended at least in therapy-refractory cases. current bacteria in cldo can be effectively treated with chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin. the commonly used antibiotics erythromycin and gentamicin are inappropriate as monotherapeutics.

TI  == bactericidal activity of besifloxacin against staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == objectives: besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that was recently approved for topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. the compound was shown to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including isolates resistant to other antibacterials. here, the bactericidal activity of besifloxacin was evaluated against the most common bacterial conjunctivitis pathogens. methods: mic, mbc and time-kill experiments with besifloxacin and comparators were performed according to clsi guidelines. quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) were sequenced using standard pcr-based techniques. results: mic and mbc data indicated that besifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against staphylococcus aureus (n = 30), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 15) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 35), while  all fluoroquinolones were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (n = 40).  besifloxacin mbc:mic ratios were < or = 4 for 97.5% of all isolates tested (n = 120). all fluoroquinolones tested, as well as tobramycin, were bactericidal, while azithromycin was bactericidal against s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, but  bacteriostatic against the staphylococci. time-kill assays with all four species  showed that besifloxacin caused > or = 1000-fold killing within 2 h for 11 of 12  isolates. only one isolate treated with moxifloxacin and three ciprofloxacin-treated isolates achieved the same level of bactericidal activity under the same conditions. unlike the comparator fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin maintained a high potency and bactericidal activity even against strains that contained multiple mutations in the genes encoding dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. conclusions: overall, besifloxacin demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against the four major human pathogens tested here, including isolates that showed in vitro resistance to other fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides or aminoglycosides.

TI  == besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6%.
AB  == besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that, like other fluoroquinolones, acts by inhibiting the essential bacterial enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. topical besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% is indicated for use in patients  with bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria. besifloxacin had in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and -negative bacteria that commonly cause ocular infections (e.g. haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae), including drug-resistant strains. in two randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered at the recommended dose for  5 days in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than vehicle in terms of clinical resolution and microbial eradication rates (coprimary endpoints) at study visit two (day 5+/-1) or three (day 8 or 9) [primary timepoints]. besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was noninferior to moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis with regard to clinical resolution (58.3% vs 59.4%) and microbial eradication (93.3% vs 91.1%) rates on day 5 +/- 1 of treatment (coprimary endpoints) in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial; both drugs were administered at a dosage of one  drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily for 5 days. besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with most adverse events being mild in severity. the tolerability profile of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was similar to that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%.

TI  == ocular pharmacokinetics of besifloxacin following topical administration to rabbits, monkeys, and humans.
AB  == purpose: studies were conducted to evaluate the ocular penetration and systemic exposure to besifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, following topical ocular  administration to animals and humans. methods: besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (0.6%) was administered as a topical ocular instillation to pigmented rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and human subjects. at predetermined intervals after dosing,  samples of ocular tissues and plasma were collected and analyzed for besifloxacin levels using hplc/ms/ms methods. results: besifloxacin demonstrated good ocular penetration in rabbits and monkeys, with rapid absorption and sustained concentrations observed in anterior ocular tissues through 24 h after a single administration. maximum besifloxacin concentrations in conjunctiva, cornea, and aqueous humor of monkeys were 6.43 microg/g, 2.10 microg/g, and 0.796 microg/ml,  respectively, after a single topical dose, and concentrations declined in these tissues with an apparent half-life of 5-14 h. following a single topical ocular administration to humans, the maximum besifloxacin concentration in tears was 610 microg/g with concentrations decreasing to approximately 1.6 microg/g at 24 h. the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters for besifloxacin in human tears were evaluated relative to the mic(90) values (microg/ml) for besifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae (0.125), staphylococcus aureus (0.25), staphylococcus epidermidis (0.5), and haemophilus influenzae (0.06). following a single topical  administration, the c(max)/mic(90) ratios for besifloxacin in human tears were >  or =1,220, and the auc((0-24))/mic(90) ratios were > or =2,500 for these relevant ocular pathogens. following repeated 3-times daily (tid) topical ocular administration to human subjects with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis, maximum besifloxacin concentrations in plasma were less than 0.5  ng/ml, on average. conclusions: taken together, the results of the current investigation provide a pk/pd-based rationale that supports the use of besifloxacin for the safe and effective treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == [an eight-year review of sensitivity to antimicrobials against isolated microorganisms from ocular infections].
AB  == objective: to obtain data beneficial for future treatment by observing the circumstances relating to microorganisms isolated in external ocular infections and drug sensitivity, along with changes in drug-resistant bacteria. subjects and methods: for an eight-year period from april 1998 to march 2006, the cultivation  and identification of secretions from conjunctival sac and drug sensitivity tests were conducted at ja gifu koseiren chuno general hospital involving 3,876 patients (1,809 males and 2,067 females; average age: 44.2 +/- 29.3 years old, ranging from 0-99 years old) diagnosed with external ocular infections by the department of ophthalmology. sensitivity test results were evaluated based on the us clsi standards. results: of the 5,002 samples, 3,447 tested positive for cultures (isolation rate: 68.9%). a total of 4,537 strains were isolated. in descending order, the microorganisms isolated were 1,706 strains of coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns), including staphylococcus epidermidis (37.6%), 936  strains of corynebacterium spp. (20.6%), 635 strains of staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), 412 strains of haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), and 246 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (5.4%). cns, corynebacterium and s. aureus were isolated in relatively large numbers in patients of all ages. h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were common in children six and under and from winter to spring. at the sametime, resistant bacteria (prsp or pisp: 166 strains; 2000 onward, blnar:  192 strains; and blpacr: 6 strains) were detected more frequently than sensitive  bacteria. h. influenzae was hypersensitive to cefotaxime (ctx) and levofloxacin.  almost no toleration of ctx was observed in s. pneumoniae. discussion and conclusion: there are distinctions in the isolated bacteria according to age and  season, and the use of drugs that are appropriate to the antibiograms of each facility should be considered.

TI  == rate of bacterial eradication by ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  == introduction: antibacterial activity of ophthalmic fourth-generation fluoroquinolones has traditionally been evaluated by comparing only their active  ingredients, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. however, ophthalmic formulations of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones differ in terms of the inclusion of preservatives. while gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% (zymar; allergan, inc., irvine, ca, usa) contains 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (bak), moxifloxacin  ophthalmic solution 0.5% (vigamox; alcon laboratories, inc., fort worth, tx, usa) is preservative-free. recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of bak dramatically affects the antibacterial activity of the ophthalmic formulation of  gatifloxacin. this study was designed to compare the kill rates of ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones against isolates of common ocular bacterial pathogens. methods: approximately 5.6 log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of haemophilus influenzae (n=1), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), staphylococcus aureus (n=2), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=4), methicillinresistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (n=4), and fluoroquinolone-resistant s. epidermidis (n=1) were incubated with ophthalmic solutions of either gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. viable bacteria were quantified at specific time points up to 60 minutes. results: gatifloxacin 0.3% completely eradicated h. influenzae and strep. pneumoniae in 5 minutes, one of two s. aureus isolates in 15 minutes, and the other s. aureus isolate in 60 minutes. gatifloxacin 0.3% completely killed all mrsa, mrse, and fluoroquinolone-resistant s. epidermidis isolates in 15 minutes. moxifloxacin 0.5% completely eradicated strep. pneumoniae and one of four mrsa isolates in 60 minutes. all other isolates incubated with moxifloxacin 0.5% retained viable bacteria ranging from 1.8 to 4.4 log(10) cfu/ml. conclusions: the ophthalmic solution of gatifloxacin 0.3% eradicated bacteria that frequently cause postoperative ocular infections substantially faster than did the ophthalmic solution of moxifloxacin 0.5%.

TI  == clinicobacteriological study of chronic dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  == chronic dacryocystitis is the inflammation of lacrimal sac, frequently caused by  bacteria. obstruction of nasolacrimal duct converts the lacrimal sac a reservoir  of infection. it is a constant threat to cornea and orbital soft tissue. moreover, it causes social embarrassment due to chronic watering from the eye. this study was conducted to find out the current clinicobacteriological profile of chronic dacryocystitis in adults. a total of 56 adult patients were selected from ophthalmology opd. detail history and clinical examinations were carried out. all patients underwent either dacryocystorhinostomy or dacryocystectomy. a part of the sac was collected for culture and sensitivity. this study revealed that chronic dacryocystitis is more common in females and left eye is more frequently involved than right eye. it is common among lower socioeconomic strata with habit of pond-bathing. some form of nasal pathology like hypertrophied inferior turbinate, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyp and allergic rhinitis werefound in 19.6% of the patients. complications of chronic dacryocystitis like  conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, acute on chronic dacryocystitis, lacrimal abscess  and fistula were seen in 25.0% of these patients; 53.6% of the culture samples were positive for bacterial growth. gram-positive organisms were most common isolate. unlike other studies, staphylococcus aureus (40.0%) was found to be most common gram-positive organism, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (10.0%) and steptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%). among the gram-negative organisms, pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%) was the most common, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (6.6%)  and haemophilus influenzae (6.6%). antibiotic sensitivity tests were done. most of the organisms were resistant to penicillin. chloramphenicol was effective against most of the gram-positive organisms. aminoglycosides, tobramycin in particular, was effective against staphylococcus epidermidis. fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa  and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == effect of lidocaine gel on povidone-iodine antisepsis and microbial survival.
AB  == purpose: to determine whether the use of lidocaine gel prior to povidone-iodine antisepsis is associated with increased microbial survival. setting: ophthalmology department, madigan army medical center, fort lewis, washington, usa. methods: a standardized suspension of staphylococcus epidermidis was used to inoculate 5 blood agar plates that served as a control. a second group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then lidocaine gel was applied to the plates. a third group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, lidocaine gel was applied, and then povidone-iodine 5% was applied and allowed to cover the plates. a fourth group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then povidone-iodine 5% was allowed to cover the plates. cultures of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenza were tested in a similar fashion. microbial growth was evaluated after 24 hours. results: the number of colony forming units  (cfus) was similar in the control group and the s epidermidis, s aureus, and p aeruginosa lidocaine only and lidocaine with povidone-iodine groups. in these groups, each plate grew between 200 cfus and 300 cfus. in the haemophilus influenza series, the lidocaine with povidone-iodine group had fewer cfus than the control group. in all 4 series, the povidone-iodine only group had the least  amount of cfus, ranging from 0 to 6. conclusions: the use of lidocaine gel before application of povidone-iodine 5% resulted in decreased effectiveness of antisepsis and increased microbial survivability. the increase in microbial survivability may increase the risk for postoperative infection in ocular surgery performed under topical anesthesia.

TI  == a critical review of oxazolidinones: an alternative or replacement for glycopeptides and streptogramins?
AB  == objective: to review the available data on the oxazolidinones linezolid and eperezolid. data selection: published reports were obtained by searching medline  for articles published between 1992 and 2000, inclusive. references of published  papers were also obtained and reviewed. abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed. data extraction: due to the limited data available regarding these agents, the criteria for study inclusion were not restrictive. data synthesis: the oxazolidinones (eg, linezolid) are a new antimicrobial class with a unique mechanism of action. they are active against resistant gram-positive cocci including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococccus epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). linezolid is active against anaerobes and displays modest activity against fastidious gram-negative pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae. linezolid is available  both orally and parenterally, and has a bioavailability of 100%. clinical trials  comparing linezolid with standard therapy have demonstrated similar bacteriological and clinical cures rates to standard therapy in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and infections caused by mrsa and vre. adverse effects have been minor and infrequent; however, platelets should be monitored in patients who have received more than two weeks of linezolid therapy. it is expected that these agents will have a bright future due to their excellent spectrum of activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms, such as mrsa, vre and prsp, and their excellent bioavailability. conclusion: the oxazolidinones represent a new class of antimicrobials with a unique mechanism of action. they have excellent activity against susceptible and resistant gram-positive organisms such as mrsa, methicillin-susceptible s epidermidis, vre and prsp, and a good adverse  effect profile; they can be administered both intravenously and orally. their potential use in canada may be as an intravenous and oral alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins.

TI  == comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  == objective: to examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. methods: mic90s (minimum inhibitory concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase iii study and confirmed externally. results: the most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the  phase iii study were haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). mic90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. on the other hand, the mic90 for h. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for s. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for s. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for s. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. conclusions: resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  == background: the high frequency of streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (ss) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. the reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in ss disease in africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the  need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. methods: a study of blood cultures in 155 ugandan children (165 episodes) with ss disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees c, attending the university teaching hospital in kampala (uganda, east africa). results: positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of  streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli and an unidentified gram negative rod. streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. conclusion: the infrequent isolation of streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with ss disease in this study and in four other studies from nigeria raises questions on  a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. there are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient  doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. these data are necessary to  determine its role in african children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial africa.

TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2  position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at  which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo  efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin  (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery  between september 1 and december 31, 2003. aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. mean +/- sd moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (mic(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. however, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h  vitreous group for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. the pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous  levels can be achieved after topical administration. further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

TI  == reflections on shunt infection.
AB  == the placement and revision of ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunts remains a mainstay in the surgical treatment of hydrocephalus. while the north american infection rate averages nearly 8-10%, published infection rates for vp shunt infection below 1% have been reported. we retrospectively reviewed shunt operations by a single surgeon over 62 months to analyze the infection rate. in 62 months, we performed 526 shunt placements or revisions in patients up to 18 years of age. there were 7 shunt infections (1.33%). in 5 cases, the organism was staphylococcus epidermidis, and a single shunt each was infected with haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus. each infection was treated with external ventriculostomy drainage and intravenous antibiotics. the new shunt was placed at a new incision site after at least 5 days of sterile spinal fluid cultures. the mean follow-up among these patients after shunt insertion was 25 months. vp shunting remains the most common operation for hydrocephalus. infections are linked with seizures, higher future risks of shunt infection and malfunction, and reduced iq and school performance. our infection rate during 62 months was limited to 1.33%. uniform surgical technique, limited hardware and skin edge manipulation and double gloving may be important factors in limiting shunt infections.

TI  == treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  == objective: to investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. methods: susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the e-test method. pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. three identical studies were conducted using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. after 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. the main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. results: in vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the mic of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin for p. aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a  denuded epithelium. all serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the s. aureus model and a similar decrease in the s pneumoniae and p aeruginosa models. conclusions: topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. clinical relevance trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.

TI  == topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (aomt) in pediatric patients. methods: this multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an aomt episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. the  mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. clinical signs and symptoms of aomt were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). a patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. principal pretherapy pathogens included streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), s epidermidis (10.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). results: ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. no change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. conclusion: topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of aomt.

TI  == [etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  == objective: to determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in ribeirao preto, state of sao paulo, and to compare it to those  reported for other communities.methods: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from january 1992 to july 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. the clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.results: the etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%,  and others agents in 6.9%. conclusions: the study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the santa lydia hospital of ribeirao preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. the study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the  agent may become difficult.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == low frequency of bacteraemia during eye surgery obviates the need for endocarditis prophylaxis.
AB  == purpose: to determine the incidence of bacteraemia following eye surgery, and thereby evaluate the need for antibiotic cover during such procedures, in patients who are at risk for bacterial endocarditis. methods: this prospective study involved 50 consecutive patients undergoing extraocular surgery at the sultan qaboos university hospital, muscat, oman. local preparation of the surgical site in all patients included pre-operative instillation of 0.3% gentamicin and 3% povidone-iodine eye drops. two eye swabs (one from the conjunctival sac and another from the eyelid margin) and two venous blood samples (one taken just before the procedure and the second 10 min into it) were collected and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. surgery-related bacteraemia was defined as a negative pre-operative blood culture followed by a positive intraoperative blood culture of the same bacterium identified in the positive eye swab. results: only two patients (4%) demonstrated surgery-related bacteraemia: one caused by staphylococcus epidermidis (following entropion correction) and the other by haemophilus influenzae (following dacryocystorhinostomy). four other patients had positive conjunctival swabs without bacteraemia, the causative organisms being haemophilus influenzae in two, and staphyloccus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae in one each. conclusion: ophthalmic surgery is not associated with significant bacteraemia, and therefore  does not mandate routine antibiotic cover in patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis. stringent pre-operative preparation of the surgical site may suffice to minimise bacteraemia; however, this requires further study.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  == development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. the normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. horizontal spread  of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. an  ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. experience from scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of  use is low (about 5%) and stable.

TI  == in vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  == purpose: time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and haemophilus influenzae. methods: for time-kill studies,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final  concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/ml in each antibiotic solution. growth controls were included. viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10,  20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. results: in general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the mic were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. at 0.5 x mic, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. at 1.0 x mic, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus within 30 minutes, and s. epidermidis and s. marcescens within 90 minutes. overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for h. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of s. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. conclusion: time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  == adherence of haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [gorter et al. (1998) j. infect. dis. 178, 1067-1078]. in this study, we showed that the adherence of h. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). defensins stimulated also the adherence of moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae to the nci-h292 cell line. in contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. these results suggest that the defensin-enhanced  adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.

TI  == [study of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotics resistance in staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == macrolide antibiotics (mac) consist of a 12- to 16-membered lactone ring combined with a sugar moiety, and they inhibit protein synthesis via binding to 23s ribosomal rna in bacteria. the 14- and 16-membered mac are used for treating infectious diseases caused by gram-positive and other bacteria; e.g., haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, legionella pneumophila, campylobacter, treponema pallidum and mycoplasma. resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin-b (mls) antibiotics in staphylococci is known to have the following mechanisms: 1) alteration of the target on ribosome due to dimethylation of a specific adenine residue in the 23s ribosomal rna by the product of the erm gene, and consequently a decrease in binding of mls antibiotics; 2) inactivation of streptogramin-b (stg-b) and lincosamide by the products of the sbh (encoding streptogramin b hydrolase) and lina' (encoding 3-lincomycin 4-clindamycin o-nucleotidyltransferase) genes, respectively; and 3) active efflux of mac and stg-b antibiotics determined by the msra and msrb genes in staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus xylosus, respectively, both of which appear to act as an atp-dependent efflux pump. i have shown that staphylococcus aureus 8325(pep2104) exhibits inducible resistance to pms (partial macrolide and streptogramin b)-antibiotics [the 14-membered macrolides, erythromycin (em), and  oleandomycin (ol), and the 16-membered macrolide mycinamicin (mcm) and stg-b]. the sequence of the n-terminal amino acid residues of a 63 kda protein (msrsa) that appeared in the membrane of pms-resistant strains was identical to that of an msra polypeptide related to enhanced efflux of [14c]em. ribosomes from pms-resistant strains showed a similar affinity for em to those from the pms-sensitive host strain nctc8325, and no inactivation of em by 8325(pep2104) was observed. in the present study, i showed the dna sequence of the msrsa region on the constitutive pms-resistant plasmid pmc38, pms-inducible resistant plasmid  pep2104 and pms-sensitive mutant plasmid psp6, and the region that is essential for inducible expression in pms resistance. in addition, i investigated the relationship between pms resistance and intracellular accumulation of em.

TI  == mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

TI  == etiology of septic arthritis in children: an update for the 1990s.
AB  == objective: to establish the etiology of septic arthritis in children after implementation of hib immunization guidelines. methods: a retrospective review of all charts with a discharge diagnosis of septic arthritis (icd-9: 711) from january 1991 to december 1996 at st. louis children's hospital was conducted. results: sixty-four patients (male = 58%) were identified, whose median age was 6.0 years. twenty-one children (33%) were misdiagnosed on initial presentation. an organism was isolated in 38 (59%) of cases. the predominant organisms were staphylococcus aureus (10 isolates), group a streptococcus (4), enterobacter species (4), kingella kingae (3), neisseria meningitides (3), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), neisseria gonorrhoeae (2), candida (2), staphylococcus epidermidis (2). the only isolate of haemophilus influenzae type b was in 1992 in an unimmunized 14 month old. conclusions: these data confirm staphylococcus aureus as a frequent pathogen and suggest that h influenzae type b is no longer the predominant isolate in young children with septic arthritis. in addition, early septic arthritis in children is frequently misdiagnosed on initial evaluation.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin a, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against  719 recent clinical gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type  cultures. hmr 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with mic90s of < or =0.5 mg/l, except for staphylococcus epidermidis (mic90 > 128 mg/l), haemophilus influenzae (mic90 = 2 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic90 = 2 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 1 mg/l) and the anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 2 mg/l) and clostridium difficile (mic90 = 1 mg/l). in general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the mics of hmr 3647. additionally, the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647 was not affected by the presence  of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. the antichlamydial activity of hmr 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.

TI  == bacteriology of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == the bacteriology of chronic sinusitis was studied by using swab and mucosal specimens from both the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. the specimens of the maxillary sinus were taken through translabial antroscopy. the specimens of the ethmoid sinus were taken after removing the ethmoid bulla during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (fess). eighty-six samples of each type of specimen were collected. among the maxillary sinus samples, the culture rate was 60.5 per cent  from the swab specimens and 36 per cent from the mucosal specimens. among the ethmoid sinus samples, the culture rate was 58.1 per cent from the swab specimens and 75.6 per cent from the mucosal. the p-value by the chi-square test is higher  than 0.01 (p = 0.015). as there were more isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis  from the mucosal specimens, they are not a better choice of specimen for sampling the ethmoid sinus than a swab specimen.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  == a total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to staphylococcus aureus (200), staphylococcus epidermidis (200), streptococcus pneumoniae (20), escherchia coli (200), klebsiella spp. (177), serratia marcescens (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), haemophilus influenzae (35) and salmonella (38) from the department of infectious diseases, la sapienza university in rome (italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of h. influenzae,  salmonella and s. pneumoniae, more than 75% of staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of enterobacteriaceae and 50% of p.  aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for klebsiella, s. aureus and epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae. levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. regarding the distribution of resistant strains in italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as e. coli and p. aeruginosa were concerned. quality control parameters are also summarized. s. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. in fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. these results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.

TI  == the effect of successful contact lens wear on mucosal immunity of the eye.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to assess the effect of contact lens wear on the mucosal defenses of the outer eye against infection. design: a case-controlled study of daily contact lens wearers in their initial 6 months of contact lens wear. participants: contact lens wearers (mean age, 23.1 years; 47 subjects) were compared with age-matched control subjects (mean age, 24.7 years; 44 subjects). intervention: outer eye defenses were studied by assay of tear constituents and quantitative conjunctival microbiology. main outcome measures: antimicrobial activity of tears was studied by assay of total immunoglobulin a (iga), iga isotype-specific antibodies reactive with escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis, albumin and lysozyme, and the ocular surface microbial load determined using quantitative microbiology of the conjunctival sac. results: the iga isotype-specific antibodies reactive with e. coli (p = 0.03) and s. epidermidis (p = 0.068) were lower in contact lens wearers, but antibody:albumin ratios were not significantly different in the two  groups. contact lens wear also had no significant effect on tear iga, albumin, or lysozyme or its ratios with albumin. bacterial numbers and colonization rates for coagulase-negative staphylococci were greater in contact lens wearers than in age-matched control subjects. corynebacterium sp. and non-enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.007) were isolated more frequently and in greater numbers from contact lens wearers. colonization rates were increased for corynebacterium sp., but non-enterobacteriaceae were transient. in both daily contact lens wearers and age-matched control subjects, most conjunctival flora were transient rather than  colonizing, and no subject developed an outer eye infection during the study. conclusion: these results suggest that daily contact lens wear does not significantly alter the mucosal defenses of the outer eye that function to eliminate organisms from the conjunctival sac and prevent outer eye infection.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic sinusitis after ampicillin therapy.
AB  == the bacteriologies of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were studied in 74 chronic sinusitis patients who took ampicillin (500 mg every 6 hours) for 2 weeks preoperatively. the specimens from one ipsilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses  were obtained when undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery. in 74 specimens of the maxillary sinus, 38 bacterial isolates were recovered. the culture rate was 46.0%. on the other hand, 34 bacterial isolates were taken from  the ethmoid sinus specimens. the culture rate was 41.9%. as compared with a previous group who did not take any antibiotic preoperatively, the culture rate significantly decreased in the maxillary as well as the ethmoid sinus specimens.  not surprisingly, a significantly decreased sensitivity to ampicillin was also found in the recovered bacteria from both the maxillary sinus (23.7%) and ethmoid sinus (5.9%) specimens. these results demonstrate that antibiotic therapy with ampicillin could eradicate most sensitive bacteria in chronic sinusitis. however, persistence of resistant bacteria was demonstrated.

TI  == a review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly sm-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against gram-negative bacteria, including the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. in contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against  gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. these extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == cq-397 and cq-414: antimicrobial activity and spectrum of two fluoroquinolone---cephalosporin, dual-action compounds with carboxamido bonds.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential spectrum of activity of two novel dual-action compounds with carboxamido bonds (cq-397 and cq-414; laboratorios aranda, san rafael, mexico) against human pathogens. methods: approximately 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic clinical bacteria were tested in vitro using the mueller-hinton broth microdilution method of the national committee of  clinical laboratory standards. results: cq-397 (cefamandole+enrofloxacin) and cq-414 (cefamandole+norfloxacin) were equally potent against enterobacteriaceae (mic90 range, 0.06--0.5 microg/ml and 0.06--1 microg/ml, respectively). citrobacter freundii (mic90, 4 microg/ml) and providencia spp. (mic90, >32 microg/ml) exhibited elevated study drug mics. enterobacteriaceae resistant to fluoroquinolones generally remained resistant. cq-397 and cq-414 were active against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml) and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), but not oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic90, >32 microg/ml), staphylococcus  epidermidis (mic90, 8 microg/ml), and enterococci (mic90s, 8 to >32 microg/ml). there was no difference in the dual-action drug activity (mic90, 2 microg/ml) between penicillin-susceptible and -resistant pneumococci. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible (mic range, less-than-or-equal0.015--0.06 microg/ml) to both compounds. conclusions: the activity of these novel dual-action compounds, formed from the bonding of older antimicrobials, warrants further investigation for potential human and/or animal  health use, including toxicology and pharmacokinetics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem dz-2640.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == [clinical studies on acute otitis media in infants less than one year old].
AB  == epidemiological and bacteriological studies were made on 164 infants less than 1  year old with acute otitis media (oma) treated at the department of otorhinolaryngology, matsuyama red cross hospital between january 1991 and december 1993. the patients consisted of 101 males (61.6%) and 63 females (38.4%). compared with the general population in matsuyama city, the preponderance of male patients with oma is statistically significant at the level of p = 0.05. in infants less than 1 year old males are likely to be more susceptible to oma than females. one hundred and four patients among the 164 (63.4%) were referred by pediatricians. fever was the most common symptom (57.9%) and the next was otorrhea (19.5%). between the patients younger than 6 months (younger group) and those 6 months old or older (older group) there were epidemiological differences which were statistically significant at the level of  p = 0.05. the older group contained 128 patients (78.0%) and the younger group 36 (22.0%). the difference in incidence between the two groups indicates that infants 6 months old or older are more susceptible to oma than those younger than 6 months. in the older group 76.6% of the patients had bilateral oma, while in 38.9% of those in the younger group the oma was bilateral. in infants 6 months old or older bilateral involvement and, in contrast, in infants younger than 6 months unilateral involvement was more frequent. the period needed to cure oma was confirmed for 179 ears of 106 patients. for 80 (44.7%) of the 179 ears the period extended beyond 4 weeks. seventy-five of the 80 ears were those of patients in the older group. oma in the older group tended to be more resistant to treatment. the middle ear secretion of 117 ears was examined bacteriologically. specimens were collected from middle ear effusion of 99 ears following myringotomy and from otorrhea in 18 ears. cultures of 68 specimens were positive for one species of bacteria and 13 cultures yielded two species. streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and haemophilus influenzae were the three most common microorganisms in middle ear effusion. but it was considered that s. spidermidis was not pathogenic and was a result of contamination. in otorrhea s. aureus was frequently found. no difference in the results of bacteriological study was noted between the two groups. transplacental igg1 and igg2 antibodies to s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are known to decrease after birth and their serum levels are lowest between ages 6 months and 1 year. then the serum levels of the immunoglobulins increase gradually with active production until age 4 years. the incidence and period of restitution of oma in infants less than 1 year old in the present study seem to reflect the above change in the serum levels of igg1 and igg2 mentioned. based on the above results emphasis is placed on close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and the pediatrician in the treatment of oma in an infant less than 1 year old. particularly careful follow-up is important in patients in the older age group because they tend to be more susceptible to oma and the disease is more resistant to treatment.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == contamination of multi-use closed tracheal suction catheters: an in-vitro study.
AB  == the use of closed multi-use tracheal suction systems in ventilated patients is increasingly popular as it offers a number of potential physiological and microbiological advantages. as the use of these systems has been associated with  an increased prevalence of tracheal colonization, effective self-cleaning mechanisms employed in these catheters are necessary. using an in-vitro model we  assessed the degree of catheter colonization in two multi-use catheter systems; stericath and trach-care. fifty of each catheter type were tested for colonization with five challenge organisms: staphylococcus aureus (nctc 6571); pseudomonas aeruginosa (nctc 10662); haemophilus influenzae type b; s. epidermidis (slime producer); and s. epidermidis (slime non-producer). all five challenge strains had colonized both catheter types after 24 h and all 100 catheter tips were colonized. the extent and density of colonization was variable and interspecies variation in the pattern of catheter colonization was observed.  the mean colonized lengths of stericath catheters was 10.9 +/- 1.4 cm and of trach-care 2.7 +/- 1.3 cm (p < 0.0001).

TI  == [dirithromycin in the treatment of infections of the lower respiratory tract].
AB  == good results of the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections with dirithromycin (eli lilly, usa), a new semisynthetic macrolide, were recorded. the trial included 15 patients: 6 with acute bronchitis (ab) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ab) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ecb). the antibiotic was administered orally in a single dose of 500  mg once a day for 7 days. the treatment efficacy was estimated by the clinical results and laboratory findings. the sputum specimens were investigated bacteriologically with testing the microflora for the drug susceptibility by using the diffusion disks. 50 per cent of the patients with ab isolated streptococcus viridans with low (the diameter of the growth inhibition zones < 16 mm) and intermediate (16-17 mm) susceptibility to the antibiotic, 33.3 per cent of the patients isolated highly susceptible (19 mm) strains of str. pneumonia and 16.7 per cent of the patients isolated resistant (15 mm) strains of staphylococcus epidermidis. highly susceptible (17-19 mm) strains of haemophilus  influenzae and str. viridans were isolated respectively from 55.5 and 45.5 per cent of the patients with ecb. in 4 patients with ecb a clinical improvement of the state was recorded. in the other patients with ab and ecb the recovery was stated. the bacteriological tests revealed a new pathogen in 2 patients with ecb  and the failure of the treatment in another 2 patients with ecb. in all the other patients the pathogen was shown to be eradicated. in the patients isolating the new pathogen the symptomatic recovery was stated in the posttherapeutic period. therefore, diritromycin proved to be efficient in 13 out of the 15 patients with  lower respiratory tract infections. it should be noted that the drug tolerance was excellent. none of the patients showed any adverse reactions.

TI  == effect of inflammation on intraocular penetration of intravenous ofloxacin in albino rabbits.
AB  == the effect of inflammation on the intraocular penetration of ofloxacin was studied in 20 albino rabbits (new zealand white). inflammation was induced in the left eye by inoculation of a suspension of 10(9) cfu of heat-killed staphyloccus  epidermidis per 0.1 ml of saline solution (0.9%) in the midvitreous cavity. the other eye was kept as a control. twenty-four hours following inoculation, ofloxacin was administered in the marginal ear vein at a dose of 15 mg/kg over 20 min with an infusion pump. animals were sacrificed at different times up to 24 h  following drug administration. ofloxacin levels were determined in aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and serum by a bioassay. inflammation was scored on the basis of  perilimbal and corneal reactions and vitreoretinal statuses. inflammation had a relevant effect on intraocular penetration of ofloxacin, with levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye markedly exceeding the ones of the control eye. in the uninflamed eye, the levels were rapidly decaying below assay sensitivity and were no longer detectable at approximately 5 h following drug administration  while they were still detectable in both ocular fluids of the inflamed eye at 24  h. ofloxacin levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye were superior to the mic for several of the bacteria which commonly cause endophthalmitis, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == the role of hsv-induced fc- and c3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  == herpes simplex virus type-1 (hsv-1) induces fc- and c3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. the role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to hsv-infected and non-infected hep-2 cells. a flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of fitc-labelled bacteria, was developed. opsonisation of staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in  adherence to hsv-infected cells and revealed a role for c3b(i)r- and fcr-mediated adhesion. however, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment  to non-infected cells. increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the hsv-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of e. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to hsv-infected cells.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of sce-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == sce-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and e1040. against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, sce-2787 was more active than ceftazidime  and e1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. sce-2787 was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the mic90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. sce-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, although its mic90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. the activities of sce-2787 against streptococcus species, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. furthermore, mic90s of sce-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates  of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. sce-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with km or ki values of greater than 100 microm. the in vitro activity of sce-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. thus, sce-2787 appears to be a promising  cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the mics of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (mic90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of enterobacteriaceae except citrobacter freundii (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) and serratia marcescens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml). fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against pseudomonas spp, (mic90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). acinetobacter and haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against h. influenzae. methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and  methicillin-susceptible strains of s. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an mic90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (mic90 > 8 micrograms/ml). in addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against enterococcus spp. (mic90 > 8 micrograms/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. these results suggest that  fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bay y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  == in a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (ciep). twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. the lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and ciep. ciep was done to detect the bacterial antigens of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. altogether,  a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). in 10 babies, strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. eleven babies (25%) grew gram negative bacteria. the common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were strep. pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinatobacter lowfii, staph. aureus, pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. all the gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. all staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.

TI  == antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  == the major pathogens causing acute otitis media (aom) are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, with moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. the same organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. in chronic suppurative otitis media, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s aureus are most frequently found. antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating aom are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. currently, about 20% of aom cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually h influenzae or m catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in aom  than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.

TI  == acute shift in immune response to microbial activators in very-low-birth-weight infants.
AB  == investigation of lymphocyte activation in vitro to microbial pathogens was undertaken in very-low-birth-weight infants during the first 2 weeks of life. twenty-three infants with birth weights less than 1500 g were studied on day 1. normal adults (n = 23) and cord blood from seven full-term infants were used as controls. longitudinal studies were also carried out on seven of the 23 infants 2 weeks following delivery. results indicated that lymphocyte responses of very-low-birth-weight infants on day 1 of life were significantly greater than those of both adult controls and full-term infants, particularly to haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcal protein a. in contrast, response to the t cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (pha) was significantly less in very-low-birth-weight infants than in adult controls and full-term infants. the seven very-low-birth-weight infants studied showed a down-regulation of immune response in the 2 weeks following birth, such that responses on day 14 were significantly less than those on day 1 for the same activators. this shift in immune response appears to have important implications for the immune development and host defence in the post-natal period.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

AB  == the in vitro activity of faeriefungin, a new pentaene macrolide lactone antibiotic produced by streptomyces griseus var. autotrophicus, against 263 clinical bacterial isolates was examined. in contrast to the related fungicidal antibiotics nystatin and amphotericin b, which show no activity against bacteria, faeriefungin showed bactericidal activity against all species of gram-positive bacteria examined. mics for these species ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml, and  the mic for 90% of the isolates tested was 32 micrograms/ml. isolates of some fastidious gram-negative species, including neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae, were slightly susceptible to faeriefungin, with mics ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, but all members of  the families enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae, with the exception of pseudomonas cepacia, were completely resistant to faeriefungin at the concentrations tested. faeriefungin is also active against fungi, nematodes, and  mosquito larvae. the mode of action of faeriefungin against both bacteria and fungi is under investigation.

TI  == clinical management of orbital cellulitis in children.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out by the department of ophthalmology and the division of infectious disease at the children's hospital of eastern ontario to assess the outcome of our medical management of orbital cellulitis in children using a predetermined antibiotic regimen and to determine whether computed tomographic (ct) evidence of a subperiosteal abscess alone was an indication for  surgical drainage. between february 1985 and january 1988, 23 patients with true  orbital cellulitis were admitted. ct scans were ordered routinely at the time of  admission. the scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. ct showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. the results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. ct should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

AB  == a study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria present in the middle ear of patients with otitis media with effusion. middle ear effusions (mee), nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were obtained at operation and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. two hundred and fifty-nine effusions were obtained from 152 subjects examined. haemophilus influenzae was isolated from 32 (12.3 per cent) effusions, streptococcus pneumoniae from seven (2.7 per cent), staphylococcus aureus from seven (2.7 per cent), branhamella catarrhalis from one (0.4 per cent)--group a beta haemolytic streptococci from one (0.4 per cent) and staphylococcus epidermidis from three (1.9 per cent). the occurrence of respiratory pathogens in mee reflected their prevalence in the upper respiratory tract. significantly fewer children who had received antibiotics prior to surgery had organisms present in the mee. eight and a half per cent of h. influenzae and 64 per cent of b. catarrhalis were resistant to ampicillin. the present study confirms that bacteria are present in the middle ear in a significant number of patients with otitis media with effusion.

TI  == [the ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  == the prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from linko chang-gung memorial hospital (2,300 beds) in the period january 1985 to december 1986 and from taipei veterans general hospital (2,300 beds) during the period january 1986 to december 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) the isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species. (vi) the most common bacteria among fastidious gram negative bacilli was haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) of these gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) n. meningitidis. (viii) the more common isolates of gram positive bacilli included bacillus species and corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) of these gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of staphylococcus species and streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. the most common isolate among gram positive cocci was staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then s. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). the less common isolates were streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and s. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus in otitis media with effusion.
AB  == bacteriologic investigation of middle ear effusion (mee), external ear canal, and the nasopharynx was carried out on 458 patients with otitis media with effusion.  staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common bacteria in mee, even after excluding the contaminants from the external ear canal, which had the same value  of minimal inhibitory concentration as the paired mee. the bacterial agreement of s epidermidis between mee and the nasopharynx was extremely rare in contrast with haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and branhamella catarrhalis, although the organism was also frequently isolated from the nasopharynx. staphylococcus aureus, having the same minimal inhibitory concentration as that in the nasopharynx, was more frequently found in mee than s epidermidis. the results suggest that s epidermidis found in mee is not a pathogen, but rather a contaminant in many instances. staphylococcus aureus seems to be a causative agent in otitis media with effusion.

TI  == serous otitis media (s.o.m.). a bacteriological study of the ear canal and the middle ear.
AB  == a bacteriological study of the middle-ear effusions and the ear canals in children with chronic serous otitis media (s.o.m.) was performed. sixty-eight children (127 ears) were investigated. from this study it appeared that cleansing of the ear canal with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol for 30 s is partially effective; micro-organisms (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis) could still  be isolated in 29%. cleansing of the ear canal decreases the incidence of middle-ear fluid contamination by non-pathogenic ear canal organisms (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis, aerococcus), but after cleansing, 'non-pathogenic' micro-organisms could still be isolated in 33% of the effusions  (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis). from 12% of the middle-ear effusions pathogenic micro-organisms (hemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus pneumoniae) were isolated; cleansing of the ear canal did not influence this percentage. anaerobics were not isolated from the middle-ear effusions.

TI  == bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  == bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. the authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from january 1983 to march 1986 at the king khaled eye  specialist hospital, riyadh, saudia arabia. all patients were followed for at least 6 months. clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. the causative organisms among those patients included: streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). in addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (p less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (p less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (p less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (p less than 0.0001). the authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.

TI  == the effects of sinus bacteria on human ciliated nasal epithelium in vitro.
AB  == the mechanisms by which bacteria colonize and damage ciliated epithelium are important in understanding the pathophysiology of rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis. bacteria that have the ability to impair mucociliary clearance would be at an advantage in establishing infection of ciliated surfaces. this study investigates the effect of hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis on the ciliary activity of normal ciliated nasal epithelium in human beings. ciliary activity of the nasal epithelium in the presence of each pathogen was assessed for more than 240  minutes with a photometric method of ciliary beat frequency (cbf) measurement. h. influenzae exerted significant effects on ciliary activity, with a 46% decrease in the cbf by 4 hours (with bacteria-containing broth) and a 32% decrease with bacteria-free filtrate. s. epidermidis decreased cbf by 44% with the bacterial broth. a sterile cell-free filtrate had no significant effect. s. pneumoniae and  b. catarrhalis had no significant effect on cbf within a 240-minute period. h. influenzae and s. epidermidis disrupted normal synchronous ciliary motion, causing adjacent cilia to beat at different rates.

TI  == in vitro studies of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (mic 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. tobramycin was highly active against p. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. the quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. all the quinolones showed high activity against staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. the pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (mic range 4-32 mg/l). all isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). cefuroxime was also highly active against n. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against h. influenzae. the quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates (mic range 1-16 mg/l). the mics of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at ph 8.8 than those  obtained at ph 5.8 and 7.3. the activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in ph.

AB  == a microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; candida albicans: 29.4%; staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. in the majority of specimens with p. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. these strains were identical in colony appearance, o-serotype and pyocin-type. quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for p. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for p. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for s. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for s.  epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for c. albicans in the majority of specimens. significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. maximum persistence was observed for p. aeruginosa. p. maltophilia and a. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates,  which were lower than those for p. aeruginosa but above those for s. aureus and h. influenzae. s. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than s. aureus. c. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified,  showed a very low persistence rate. the microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of p. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of p. maltophilia and c. albicans). this underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by middle ear macrophages.
AB  == because macrophage dysfunction has been suggested as one of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for otitis media with effusion, we have examined macrophage-bacterial interactions using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced middle  ear macrophages from chinchillas. our data indicate that macrophages recruited to the middle ear were functional phagocytes capable of discriminate phagocytosis and intracellular killing of eight species of bacteria associated with otitis media, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. streptococcus pneumoniae types 14 and 19f, which are associated with the highest relapse frequency in cases of acute otitis media, were the most resistant to phagocytosis. the two organisms most often involved in chronic otitis media (staphylococcus epidermidis and nontypable haemophilus influenzae), however, were among the most readily phagocytized isolates. the relative importance of macrophage function in defense  of the middle ear, therefore, may be dependent on the causative agent.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == the comparison of myocardial dysfunction in three forms of experimental septic shock.
AB  == a rabbit model of septic shock was used to determine if myocardial dysfunction is a common component of shock due to diverse neonatal pathogens, and prostaglandins modulate septic myocardial dysfunction. the infusion of heat-killed escherichia coli (group i), haemophilus influenzae (group ii), or staphylococcus epidermidis  (group iii) produced significant decreases in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time (p less than 0.05). each organism also  produced significant changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate, while pulmonary artery pressure was altered in groups i and iii. saline-infused control animals (group iv) exhibited no significant changes in any hemodynamic variable. blood gas variables were not significantly changed in any group. these cardiovascular changes appeared dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism since indomethacin pretreatment prevented the cardiovascular changes induced by bacterial infusion. these results suggest that septic myocardial dysfunction is a common component of gram-negative and gram-positive septic shock, and that myocardial dysfunction is modulated by prostaglandin products.

AB  == middle ear effusions and swabs from the external auditory meatus, nasopharynx and anterior nares have been collected from 100 children with chronic secretory otitis media. isolates of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae were typed and in vitro sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics were determined for these species and staphylococcus aureus. positive middle ear cultures were obtained from 21 children (27 effusions). haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae were the commonest organisms isolated, both from the middle ear and upper respiratory tract. when one or other of these species was isolated from the middle ear, the same organism was generally found in the upper respiratory tract, but not in the ear canal. the serotypes isolated from the different sites  were also the same. type 19 was the commonest pneumococcal serotype isolated, while type e was the commonest capsulated strain of h. influenzae. thirty-six per cent of strains of h. influenzae were resistant to penicillin and 25% of those of s. pneumoniae were resistant to trimethaprim. eighty-one per cent of isolates of  s. aureus were penicillin resistant. there was no difference in the incidence of  either s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae in the post nasal spaces of children who had had their adenoids removed and those who had not.

TI  == microbiology of recently treated acute otitis media compared with previously untreated acute otitis media.
AB  == isolates were obtained from 169 middle ear aspirates of 148 children with recently treated acute otitis media (rtom) and from 123 aspirates of 84 children  with previously untreated acute otitis media (uom). in rtom streptococcus pneumoniae and group a streptococcus (p less than 0.02) were recovered less frequently whereas staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.001) and haemophilus influenzae (p less than 0.02) were recovered more frequently than in uom. patients with rtom had more beta-lactamase-producing organisms and multiple isolates. bilateral sterile aspirates were more common in rtom although bilateral otitis media was more common in uom. in rtom most branhamella catarrhalis isolates were co-pathogens whereas staphylococcus epidermidis were always isolated in pure culture. amoxicillin was the antimicrobial most frequently (83.9%) received for the recently treated episode of otitis media. in rtom 62.4%  of isolates were susceptible to previously prescribed antibiotics, suggesting that factors other than antimicrobial susceptibility are also important in the occurrence of rtom.

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

AB  == mupirocin (pseudomonic acid a), an antibiotic produced by pseudomonas fluorescens, showed a high level of activity against staphylococci and streptococci and against certain gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was much less active against most gram-negative bacilli an anaerobes. nearly all clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains, were susceptible (mupirocin mic, less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). there was no cross-resistance between mupirocin and clinically available antibiotics, and the selection of resistant variants in vitro occurred  at a low frequency. mupirocin was highly bound (95% bound) to the protein of human serum, and activity was reduced 10- to 20-fold in the presence of human serum. the activity of mupirocin was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but  was significantly enhanced in acid medium. in tests of bactericidal activity, mbcs were 8- to 32-fold higher than mics and the antibiotic demonstrated a slow bactericidal action in time-kill tests, resulting in 90 to 99% killing after 24 h at 37 degrees c.

TI  == cefotaxime monotherapy of bacterial meningitis caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == primary meningitis in children is caused by two gram-negative bacterial species,  neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae, and one gram-positive bacterial species streptococcus pneumoniae. despite optimal penicillin susceptibility, with few exceptions, therapeutic results in pneumococcal meningitis are by far worse than with the other two pathogens. therefore, and because of the detection of penicillin-resistant rods, the study of alternatives  in therapy is justified and was started with cefotaxime. including six of our own patients, there are reports on 87 patients in the literature suffering from s. pneumoniae meningitis who were treated with cefotaxime monotherapy. results of these studies will be analyzed. as none of these patients belonged to a prospective controlled study group, final evaluation in comparison with penicillin therapy remains open. there are also several reports on successful treatment of group b streptococcus meningitis with cefotaxime, although there is  no need to abandon penicillin therapy. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis, usually secondary in shunted hydrocephalus, brain tumors, brain injury or other causes, should not be treated with cefotaxime because of its limited activity on these bacteria. listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus  faecalis are primarily cefotaxime-resistant, and neonatal meningitis of unknown origin, therefore, should not be treated with cefotaxime alone as long as these pathogens cannot be excluded.

TI  == antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the massachusetts general hospital, boston, mass., and the bronx lebanon hospital center, new york, n.y., were compared. strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year  period, whereas streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. the close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in u.s. hospitals. since most of the species  analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  == a review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. an evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean mic90 being  less than 8 mg/l. the mic90 for cocci, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. the mic90 for all enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only pseudomonas maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic  resistance. imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the mic usually being below 1 mg/l even for bacteroides fragilis. rare bacteria such as nocardia asteroides, listeria monocytogenes or fast growing mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. in most species the mbc only slightly exceeded the mic; however in the case of streptococcus faecalis the mbc value was many times the mic value. synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

TI  == recognition and clinical significance of mechanisms of bacterial resistance to beta-lactams.
AB  == resistance to beta-lactams may be difficult to recognize. this is due to the difficulty in detecting these resistances, when the routine tests performed in diagnostic laboratories are interpreted in the usual manner. since failure to recognize this type of resistance may have serious consequences for the patient,  it is essential that it be detected when present. for the detection of methicillin resistance of staphylococcus aureus a standardized method using either a medium containing 5% nacl or a low incubation temperature is advocated.  methicillin resistance of s. epidermidis can only be recognized reliably by means of a quantitative test and incubation for 42-48 h. resistance of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin may be intrinsic or it may be caused by a tem beta-lactamase; a beta-lactamase test should be used to detect the latter type of resistance. inducible cephalosporinase may be responsible for the rapid development of resistance of some bacterial species to cefamandole, even during therapy. if a stable beta-lactamase production is attained by mutation, resistance to other beta-lactams will usually be present as well. routine induction tests should be performed for all isolates of species of enterobacter,  serratia, citrobacter and proteus, indole-positive. the same type of 'hidden' resistance may be present in pseudomonas aeruginosa, with regard to cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins. beta-lactamase-positive neisseria gonorrhoeae can easily be recognized by a beta-lactamase test. in addition, the results of diffusion tests allow one to distinguish between beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains. recognition of those strains of n. gonorrhoeae having a decreased susceptibility to penicillin is only possible when well-standardized quantitative tests are used.

TI  == rapidity of c-reactive protein in detecting potential septicemia.
AB  == eight episodes of clinical septicemia in five children were assessed using c-reactive protein (crp) determinations. the measurements were performed turbidimetrically, with quantitative results available in less than 10 minutes. three patients had epiglottitis, one had recurrent septicemia secondary to severe underlying illnesses and one patient was followed postoperatively after open heart surgery. regardless of etiology septicemia was consistently associated with a rapid increase (greater than or equal to 20 to 214 mg/liter) in the crp concentration. elevated values were obtained 5, 13 and 16 hours after the onset of symptoms of epiglottitis. when determined the crp level was invariably elevated at the time of the first positive blood culture. crp determinations in patients with symptoms of septicemia would have supported the diagnosis at least  24 hours before the positive blood culture. in addition, sequential crp measurements proved beneficial in monitoring the course of septicemia.

TI  == third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: ii. microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, hemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. in general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria gonorrhea. they also tend to be active against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis. however, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. these cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  == fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to  the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == a controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  == optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. we studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in  the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double  blind comparative trial. infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included streptococcus pneumoniae (14), haemophilus influenzae type b (5), h. influenzae nontypeable (3), staphylococcus aureus (4),  branhamella sp. (2), and streptococcus pyogenes (1). nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and streptococcus viridans. two aspirates were sterile. a satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of  19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. we conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.

TI  == experimental otitis media in gerbils and chinchillas with streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == to ascertain the usefulness of mongolian gerbils as an inbred model for otitis media, 52 mongolian gerbils (meriones unguiculatus, strain mont/tum) were compared with 26 chinchillas (chinchilla laniger) for susceptibility to streptococcus pneumoniae type 3. haemophilus influenzae type b, and a polymicrobic culture including anaerobes (streptococcus intermedius, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, and corynebacterium sp.). organisms were inoculated percutaneously into the superior chamber of the middle  ear bulla. the gerbils and chinchillas shared similar susceptibilities and responses to the inoculated organisms as determined by x-ray, otoscopic, histopathological, and microbiological determinations at 5 to 7 days. koch's postulate studies proved the role of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae in the pathology found in both animal models. the animals were also susceptible to the polymicrobic culture, although the relative virulence of the individual members of this mixture was low, suggesting that these species potentiated as a polymicrobic mixture. the corynebacterium sp. appeared to elicit the greatest histopathological response in chronic (8-week) studies in gerbils. the gerbils were found to be useful as an alternative animal model for the study of otitis media of bacterial etiology.

TI  == the bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  == the bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. thirty-five percent of these  chronic effusions were culture-positive. type b and non-type b haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria sp. and staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. in addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. effusions which yielded h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded s. epidermidis or neisseria or were sterile. phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on gram stain. phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. the results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid penicillinase paper strip test for detection of beta-lactamase.
AB  == the penicillin-starch paper strip method was compared with the acidometric and iodometric methods for assaying beta-lactamase production, using fresh isolates of clinically important bacteria. results obtained by the three methods were compared for rapidity, accuracy, and stability of reagents. of the 210 isolates tested by the paper strip method, 301 isolates tested by the acidometric method,  and 117 isolates tested by the iodometric method, all were in perfect agreement with the disk diffusion susceptibility test except one strain each of haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the h. influenzae isolate was penicillin resistant and failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase in all three tests. the staphylococci (intermediate and resistant in susceptibility, respectively) failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase with the iodometric method. the results of the paper strip method, in which 3,241 strains representing nine species of bacteria were used, correlated completely with disk susceptibility tests except for 2 and 69 strains, respectively, of penicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-negative h. influenzae and  h. parainfluenzae. the results of this study indicate that the paper strip method is accurate, simple to perform, extremely economical, and uses materials that are stable when stored frozen. it is eminently suitable for routine laboratory use.

AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  == the significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative staphylococcus epidermidis and corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. this study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and  nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in  both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. the results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. there is some evidence that specific igm and igg as well as iga responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. these results  suggest that coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. one very interesting point is the presence  of igf coating of organisms in some effusions.
