TI  == molybdate and sulfide inhibit h2 and increase formate production from glucose by  ruminococcus albus.
AB  == h2 production from glucose by ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) m molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. the results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form h2 are used to reduce co2 to formate. growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) m. reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of h2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) m molybdate. h2 production by r. bromei but not by r. flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, veillonella alcalescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.
