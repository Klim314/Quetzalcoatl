TI  == computing smallest intervention strategies for multiple metabolic networks in a boolean model.
AB  == this article considers the problem whereby, given two metabolic networks n1 and n2, a set of source compounds, and a set of target compounds, we must find the minimum set of reactions whose removal (knockout) ensures that the target compounds are not producible in n1 but are producible in n2. similar studies exist for the problem of finding the minimum knockout with the smallest side effect for a single network. however, if technologies of external perturbations are advanced in the near future, it may be important to develop methods of computing the minimum knockout for multiple networks (mkmn). flux balance analysis (fba) is efficient if a well-polished model is available. however, that  is not always the case. therefore, in this article, we study mkmn in boolean models and an elementary mode (em)-based model. integer linear programming (ilp)-based methods are developed for these models, since mkmn is np-complete for both the boolean model and the em-based model. computer experiments are conducted with metabolic networks of clostridium perfringens sm101 and bifidobacterium longum djo10a, respectively known as bad bacteria and good bacteria for the human intestine. the results show that larger networks are more likely to have mkmn solutions. however, solving for these larger networks takes a very long time, and often the computation cannot be completed. this is reasonable, because small networks do not have many alternative pathways, making it difficult to satisfy the mkmn condition, whereas in large networks the number of candidate solutions explodes. our developed software minfvsko is available online.

TI  == feed supplementation with red seaweeds, chondrus crispus and sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii, affects performance, egg quality, and gut microbiota of layer hens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of red seaweed  supplementation to standard poultry diets on production performance, egg quality, intestinal histology, and cecal short-chain fatty acids in lohmann brown classic  laying hens. a total of 160 birds were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups. control hens were fed a basal layer diet; positive control hens were fed a diet containing 2% inulin; and 6 treatment groups were fed a diet containing one of the following; 0.5, 1, or 2% chondrus crispus (cc0.5, cc1, and cc2, respectively) and one of the same 3 levels of sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii (sg0.5, sg1, and sg2,  respectively). dietary supplementation had no significant effect on the feed intake, bw, egg production, fecal moisture content, and blood serum profile of the birds. the feed conversion ratio per gram of egg was significantly more efficient (p = 0.001) for cc2 and sg2 treatments. moreover, sg1 supplementation increased egg yolk weight (p = 0.0035) and birds with cc1 supplementation had higher egg weight (p = 0.0006). the sg2 and cc2 groups had greater (p < 0.05) villus height and villus surface area compared with the control birds. seaweed supplementation increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria [e.g., bifidobacterium longum (4- to 14-fold), streptococcus salivarius (4- to 15-fold)] and importantly reduced the prevalence of clostridium perfringens in the gut of the chicken. additionally, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, and i-butyric acid, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cc and sg treatments than in the control. in conclusion, dietary supplementation using red seaweed inclusions can act as a potential prebiotic to improve performance, egg quality, and overall gut health in layer hens.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == a probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  == objectives: evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics bifidobacterium longum bar33 and lactobacillus helveticus bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. participants: thirty-two elderly volunteers living in italy. the group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). intervention: subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. measurements: for each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform htf-microbi.array before and after intervention. results: our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. in particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens clostridium cluster xi, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecium  and the enteropathogenic genus campylobacter. conclusion: the present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == enzymatic depolymerization of gum tragacanth: bifidogenic potential of low molecular weight oligosaccharides.
AB  == gum tragacanth derived from the plant "goat's horn" (astragalus sp.) has a long history of use as a stabilizing, viscosity-enhancing agent in food emulsions. the gum contains pectinaceous arabinogalactans and fucose-substituted xylogalacturonans. in this work, gum tragacanth from astragalus gossypinus was enzymatically depolymerized using aspergillus niger pectinases (pectinex be color). the enzymatically degraded products were divided into three molecular weight fractions via membrane separation: hag1 < 2 kda; 2 kda < hag2 < 10 kda; hag3 > 10 kda. compositional and linkage analyses showed that these three fractions also varied with respect to composition and structural elements: hag1 and hag2 were enriched in arabinose, galactose, and galacturonic acid, but low in fucose and xylose, whereas hag3 was high in (terminal) xylose, fucose, and 1,4-bonded galacturonic acid, but low in arabinose and galactose content. the growth-stimulating potential of the three enzymatically produced gum tragacanth fractions was evaluated via growth assessment on seven different probiotic strains in single-culture fermentations on bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (two strains), b. longum subsp. infantis (three strains), lactobacillus acidophilus , b. lactis, and on one pathogenic strain of clostridium perfringens  . the fractions hag1 and hag2 consistently promoted higher growth of the probiotic strains than hag3, especially of the three b. longum subsp. infantis strains, and the growth promotion on hag1 and hag2 was better than that on galactan (control). hag3 completely inhibited the growth of the c. perfringens strain. tragacanth gum is thus a potential source of prebiotic carbohydrates that exert no viscosity effects and which may find use as natural functional food ingredients.

TI  == the principal fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk exhibit prebiotic properties on cultured infant microbiota.
AB  == breast-fed infant microbiota is typically rich in bifidobacteria. herein, major human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are assessed for their ability to promote the  growth of bifidobacteria and to acidify their environment, key features of prebiotics. during in vitro anaerobic fermentation of infant microbiota, supplementation by hmos significantly decreased the ph even greater than supplementation by fructooligosaccharide (fos), a prebiotic positive control. hmos elevated lactate concentrations, increased the proportion of bifidobacterium spp. in culture, and through their fermentation into organic acids, decreased the proportion of escherichia and clostridium perfringens. three principal components of hmos, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose and 3-fucosyllactose, were consumed in these cultures. these three principal oligosaccharides of human milk  were then individually tested as supplements for in vitro growth of four individual representative strains of infant gut microbes. bifidobacterium longum  jcm7007 and b. longum atcc15697 efficiently consumed oligosaccharides and produced abundant lactate and short-chain fatty acids, resulting in significant ph reduction. the specificity of fermentation differed by microbe species and strain and by oligosaccharide structure. escherichia coli k12 and c. perfringens  did not utilize appreciable fucosylated oligosaccharides, and a typical mixture of organic acid fermentation products inhibited their growth. in summary, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, and 3-fucosyllactose, when cultured with  b. longum jcm7007 and b. longum atcc15697, exhibit key characteristics of a prebiotic in vitro. if these bifidobacteria are representative of pioneering or keystone species for human microbiota, fucosylated hmos could strongly promote colonization and maintenance of a mutualist symbiotic microbiome. thus, these simple glycans could mediate beneficial effects of human milk on infant health.

TI  == treatment of bran containing bread by baking enzymes; effect on the growth of probiotic bacteria on soluble dietary fiber extract in vitro.
AB  == different ways of treating bran by baking enzymes prior to dough making and the baking process were used to increase the amount of water-soluble dietary fiber (df) in wheat bread with added bran. soluble df was extracted from the bread with water and separated from the digestible material with gastrointestinal tract enzymes and by solvent precipitation. the baking enzyme mixtures tested (xylanase and glucanase/cellulase, with and without lipase) increased the amounts of soluble arabinoxylan and protein resistant to digestion. the isolated fiber was used as a growth substrate for 11 probiotic and intestinal bifidobacterium strains, for commensal strains of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli, and  for potential intestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium perfringens. fermentation analyses indicated that the tested strains had varying capacity to grow in the presence of the extracted  fiber. of the tested probiotic strains b. longum species generally showed the highest ability to utilize the fiber extracts, although the potential pathogens tested also showed an ability to grow on these fiber extracts. in sum, the enzymes used to improve the baking process for high-fiber bread can also be used  to produce in situ soluble fiber material, which in turn can exert prebiotic effects on certain potentially beneficial microbes.

TI  == expression and characterization of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from emericella nidulans in pichia pastoris for enzymatic design of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides from potato galactans.
AB  == potato pulp is a high-volume side-stream from industrial potato starch manufacturing. enzymatically solubilized beta-1,4-galactan-rich potato pulp polysaccharides of molecular weights >100 kda (sppp) are highly bifidogenic in human fecal sample fermentations in vitro. the objective of the present study was to use potato beta-1,4-galactan and the sppp as substrates for enzymatic production of potentially prebiotic compounds of lower and narrower molecular weight. a novel endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from emericella nidulans (anamorph aspergillus nidulans), gh family 53, was produced in a recombinant pichia pastoris strain. the enzyme was purified by cu(2+) affinity chromatography and its optimal reaction conditions were determined to ph 5 and 49 degrees c via a statistical experimental design. the specific activity of the e. nidulans enzyme  expressed in p. pastoris was similar to that of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from aspergillus niger used as benchmark. the e. nidulans enzyme expressed in p. pastoris generated a spectrum poly- and oligo-saccharides which were fractionated by membrane filtration. the potential growth promoting properties of each fraction were evaluated by growth of beneficial gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria. all the galactan- and sppp-derived products promoted the growth of probiotic strains of bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus and generally did not support the propagation of clostridium perfringens in single culture fermentations. notably the growth of b. longum was significantly higher (p<0.05) or at least as good on galactan- and sppp-derived products as fructooligosaccharides (fos). except in one case these products did not support the growth of the pathogen cl. perfringens to any significant extent.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == crystallographic and mutational analyses of substrate recognition of endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (endo-alpha-galnac-ase), a member of the glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 101, hydrolyses the o-glycosidic bonds in mucin-type o-glycan between alpha-galnac and ser/thr. endo-alpha-galnac-ase from  bifidobacterium longum jcm1217 (engbf) is highly specific for the core 1-type o-glycan to release the disaccharide galbeta1-3galnac (gnb), whereas endo-alpha-galnac-ase from clostridium perfringens (engcp) exhibits broader substrate specificity. we determined the crystal structure of engbf at 2.0 a resolution and performed automated docking analysis to investigate possible binding modes of gnb. mutational analysis revealed important residues for substrate binding, and two trp residues (trp748 and trp750) appeared to form stacking interactions with the beta-faces of sugar rings of gnb by substrate-induced fit. the difference in substrate specificities between engbf and engcp is attributed to the variations in amino acid sequences in the regions  forming the substrate-binding pocket. our results provide a structural basis for  substrate recognition by gh101 endo-alpha-galnac-ases and will help structure-based engineering of these enzymes to produce various kinds of neo-glycoconjugates.

TI  == identification of lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase from vibrio vulnificus cmcp6.
AB  == a beta-1,3-galactosyl-n-acetylhexosamine phosphorylase (galglynacp) homolog gene  was cloned from vibrio vulnificus cmcp6. in synthetic reactions, the recombinant  enzyme acted only with glcnac and galnac as acceptors in the presence of alpha-d-galactose-1-phosphate as a donor to form lacto-n-biose i (lnb) (galbeta1  --> 3glcnac) and galacto-n-biose (gnb) (galbeta1 --> 3galnac), respectively. glcnac was a much better acceptor than galnac. the enzyme also phosphorolysed lnb faster than it phosphorolysed gnb, and the k(cat)/k(m) for lnb was approximately  60 times higher than the k(cat)/k(m) for gnb. this result indicated that the enzyme was remarkably different from galglynacp from bifidobacterium longum, which has similar activities with lnb and gnb, and galglynacp from clostridium perfringens, which is a gnb-specific enzyme. the enzyme is the first lnb-specific enzyme that has been found and was designated lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase. the  discovery of an lnb-specific galglynacp resulted in recategorization of bifidobacterial galglynacps as galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylases.

TI  == top-down systems biology integration of conditional prebiotic modulated transgenomic interactions in a humanized microbiome mouse model.
AB  == gut microbiome-host metabolic interactions affect human health and can be modified by probiotic and prebiotic supplementation. here, we have assessed the effects of consumption of a combination of probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei or l. rhamnosus) and two galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics on the symbiotic microbiome-mammalian supersystem using integrative metabolic profiling and modeling of multiple compartments in germ-free mice inoculated with a model of human baby microbiota. we have shown specific impacts of two prebiotics on the microbial populations of hbm mice when co-administered with two probiotics. we observed an increase in the populations of bifidobacterium longum and b. breve, and a reduction in clostridium perfringens, which were more marked when combining prebiotics with l. rhamnosus. in turn, these microbial effects were associated with modulation of a range of host metabolic pathways observed via changes in lipid profiles, gluconeogenesis, and amino-acid and methylamine metabolism associated to fermentation of carbohydrates by different bacterial strains. these results provide evidence for the potential use of prebiotics for beneficially modifying the gut microbial balance as well as host energy and lipid homeostasis.

TI  == characterization of two different endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases from probiotic and pathogenic enterobacteria, bifidobacterium longum and clostridium perfringens.
AB  == endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase (endo-alpha-galnac-ase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the o-glycosidic bond between alpha-galnac at the reducing end of mucin-type sugar chains and serine/threonine of proteins to release oligosaccharides. previously, we identified the gene engbf encoding endo-alpha-galnac-ase from bifidobacterium longum, which specifically released the disaccharide gal beta 1-3galnac (fujita k, oura f, nagamine n, katayama t, hiratake j, sakata k, kumagai h, yamamoto k. 2005. identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type o-glycan-specific endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from bifidobacterium longum. j biol chem. 280:37415-37422). here we cloned a similar gene named engcp from clostridium perfringens, a pathogenic enterobacterium, and characterized the gene product engcp. detailed analyses on substrate specificities of engcp and engbf using a series of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-glycosides chemically synthesized by the di-tert-butylsilylene-directed method revealed that both enzymes released hex/hexnac beta 1-3galnac (hex = gal or glc). engcp could also release the core 2 trisaccharide gal beta 1-3(glcnac beta 1-6)galnac, core 8 disaccharide gal alpha  1-3galnac, and monosaccharide galnac. our results suggest that engcp possesses broader substrate specificity than engbf. actions of the two enzymes on native glycoproteins and cell surface glycoproteins were also investigated.

TI  == identification of galacto-n-biose phosphorylase from clostridium perfringens atcc13124.
AB  == lacto-n-biose phosphorylase (lnbp) from bifidobacteria is involved in the metabolism of lacto-n-biose i (galbeta1-->3glcnac, lnb) and galacto-n-biose (galbeta1-->3galnac, gnb). a homologous gene of lnbp (cpf0553 protein) was identified in the genome of clostridium perfringens atcc13124, which is a gram-positive anaerobic intestinal bacterium. in the present study, we cloned the gene and compared the substrate specificity of the cpf0553 protein with lnbp from bifidobacterium longum jcm1217 (lnbpbl). in the presence of alpha-galactose 1-phosphate (gal 1-p) as a donor, the cpf0553 protein acted only on glcnac and galnac, and galnac was a more effective acceptor than glcnac. the reaction product from glcnac/galnac and gal 1-p was identified as lnb or gnb. the cpf0553  protein also phosphorolyzed gnb much faster than lnb, which suggests that the protein should be named galacto-n-biose phosphorylase (gnbp). gnbp showed a kcat/km value for gnb that was approximately 50 times higher than that for lnb, whereas lnbpbl showed similar kcat/km values for both gnb and lnb. because c. perfringens possesses a gene coding endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, gnbp may play a role in the intestinal residence by metabolizing gnb that is available as a mucin core sugar.

TI  == the effect of probiotic fermented milk and inulin on the functions and microecology of the intestine.
AB  == we investigated the effects of a probiotic fermented milk and inulin on gastrointestinal function and microecology. the study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). after a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3x200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (bifidobacterium longum bb536, bifidobacterium spp. 420 and lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin,  or (3) a control fermented milk. during the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of ph and microbes,  including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, bacteroides  and clostridium perfringens. consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (p=0.009,  p=0.003) and bifidobacteria (p=0.046, p=0.038) compared with the baseline. compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (p=0.005, ancova). subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (p<0.001). in conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal  symptoms.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of a conjugated bile salt hydrolase from bifidobacterium longum reveals an evolutionary relationship with penicillin v acylase.
AB  == bile salt hydrolase (bsh) is an enzyme produced by the intestinal microflora that catalyzes the deconjugation of glycine- or taurine-linked bile salts. the crystal structure of bsh reported here from bifidobacterium longum reveals that it is a member of n-terminal nucleophil hydrolase structural superfamily possessing the characteristic alphabetabetaalpha tetra-lamellar tertiary structure arrangement.  site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic nucleophil residue, however, shows that it has no role in zymogen processing into its corresponding active form. substrate specificity was studied using michaelis-menten and inhibition kinetics  and fluorescence spectroscopy. these data were compared with the specificity profile of bsh from clostridium perfrigens and pencillin v acylase from bacillus  sphaericus, for both of which the three-dimensional structures are available. comparative analysis shows a gradation in activity toward common substrates, throwing light on a possible common route toward the evolution of pencillin v acylase and bsh.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type o-glycan-specific endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == we found endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase in most bifidobacterial strains, which are predominant bacteria in the human colon. this enzyme catalyzes the liberation of galactosyl beta1,3-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galbeta1,3galnac) alpha-linked to serine or threonine residues from mucin-type glycoproteins. the gene (engbf) encoding the enzyme has been cloned from bifidobacterium longum jcm  1217. the protein consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues, and the central domain  (590-1381 amino acid residues) exhibited 31-53% identity to hypothetical proteins of several bacteria including clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pneumoniae. the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli liberated galbeta1,3galnac disaccharide from galbeta1,3galnacalpha1pnp and asialofetuin, but did not release galnac, galbeta1,3(glcnacbeta1,6)galnac, glcnacbeta1,3galnac, and galbeta1,3glcnac from each p-nitrophenyl (pnp) substrate, and also did not release sialo-oligosaccharides from fetuin, indicating its strict substrate specificity for the core 1-type structure. the stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined by (1)h nmr and was found to be retention. site-directed mutagenesis of a total of 22 conserved asp and glu residues suggested that asp-682 and asp-789 are critical residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. the enzyme also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward various mono- and disaccharides and 1-alkanols, demonstrating its potential to synthesize neoglycoconjugates. this is the first report for the isolation of a gene encoding endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from any organisms and for the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family (gh family 101).

AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of cinnamomum cassia (blume) bark-derived materials toward five intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as four commercially available compounds (cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid,  eugenol, and salicylaldehyde). the biologically active component of c. cassia bark was characterized as cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. in a test using 1 and 0.5 mg/disks, cinnamaldehyde revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringensand bacteroides fragilis. at 1 and 0.5 mg/disk, growth of bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly inhibited, whereas weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against bifidobacterium longum or lactobacillus  acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in cl. perfringens, b. fragilis, and bi. bifidum, compared to bi. longum or l. acidophilus. salicylaldehyde exhibited moderate growth-inhibiting activity, but little or no inhibition was observed from treatments with cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, and eugenol. in contrast, tetracycline and chloramphenicol significantly inhibited growth of all test bacteria as low as 0.01 mg/disk. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. cassia bark.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.

TI  == oligofructose contributes to the protective role of bifidobacteria in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in quails.
AB  == bifidobacteria are dominant in the gut of full-term infants, although colonisation by them is often delayed in preterm neonates. bifidobacteria are recognised to have beneficial effects on digestive disorders and they might prevent neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (nec), a gastrointestinal disease that predominantly affects premature infants. they have been shown to protect gnotobiotic quails against nec-like lesions when the birds were inoculated with faecal flora from preterm infants, decreasing the clostridial population. the present study was designed to investigate whether oligofructose, which stimulates the activity of bifidobacteria, may enhance their protective role. experiments were done in eight groups of germ-free quails for 28 days. the groups differed as to their bacterial status, diet and environment. quails were inoculated with one  of two flora from premature twins. the first flora included bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum, escherichia coli and no clostridia. the second flora included clostridial species and was associated with b. infantis-longum. caecal bacterial  population and metabolism changes were investigated with a lactose (6%) diet versus a lactose-oligofructose (3%-3%) diet, either in a gnotobiotic environment  or in an ordinary environment permitting post-colonisation by exogenous bacteria. in both environments and with both flora, oligofructose significantly increased the level of bifidobacteria and this was associated with a decrease of e. coli or c. perfringens and c. ramosum. the bacterial changes in the ordinary environment  depended on the initial composition of the microflora and the colonisation resistance against exogenous bacteria was more efficient with the flora that included b. pseudo-catenulatum. the changes in caecal ph and short-chain fatty acids were minimal. it was demonstrated that, irrespective of the environmental conditions, the use of oligofructose helped to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria implicated in necrotising enterocolitis in preterm neonates.

TI  == clostridial pathogenicity in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in gnotobiotic quails and protective role of bifidobacteria.
AB  == the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (nec) remains unclear. gnotobiotic quails fed a lactose diet have been used to investigate the role of clostridial strains originating from faecal specimens of neonates through the intestinal lesions, the changes in microflora balance and the production of bacterial metabolites, i.e., short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen. bifidobacteria are thought to exert various beneficial effects on host health, including interaction with the colonic microflora. therefore, it was hypothesised that a protective role could be exercised through bifidobacterial colonisation. a clostridium butyricum strain (cb 155-3) and a whole faecal flora including three  clostridial species (c. butyricum, c. perfringens, c. difficile), each from premature infants suffering from nec, caused caecal lesions in quails similar to  those observed in man, i.e., thickening of the caecal wall with gas cysts, haemorrhagic ulceration and necrotic areas. conversely, a whole faecal flora including bifidobacteria (identified as bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum) and no clostridia, isolated from a healthy premature infant, was unable to produce nec-like lesions. when the two clostridial groups were associated with a bifidobacterium strain (b. infantis-longum, cuetm 89-215, isolated from a healthy infant), bifidobacterial colonisation suppressed all pathological lesions. this study is the first demonstration of a protective role for bifidobacteria against  nec via the inhibition of growth of c. butyricum or the disappearance of c. perfringens. c. difficile was not found to be responsible for the aetiology of the caecal lesions in quails. the main effect of bifidobacteria on lactose fermentation was either a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of butyric acid. the protective role was not associated with changes in h2 production. therefore,  a new step between colonic colonisation and its relevance to nec is thought to involve the fermentation of unabsorbed lactose into butyric acid at the onset of  the disease.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.
