TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == occurrence of zoonotic clostridia and yersinia in healthy cattle.
AB  == zoonotic pathogens are a frequent cause of disease worldwide. this study was designed to determine the occurrence of clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, and yersinia enterocolitica in cattle in southern bavaria, germany. the study population included 49 farms; 34 were dairy farms (30 also fattening beef cattle) and 15 were solely beef cattle farms. fecal and dust samples were collected from summer 2011 to summer 2012 and analyzed using a combination of enrichment procedures and real-time pcr. for the detection of c. difficile, samples were screened for the presence of the tpi gene and toxin genes tcda, tcdb, and cdta. samples also were screened for genes for c. botulinum toxins a through f and for the ail gene of y. enterocolitica. of 506 samples, c. difficile genes were found in 29 samples (5.7%): 25 samples from dairy farms and 4 samples  from beef cattle farms. toxin genes were identified in 17 samples, with toxigenic profiles of a(+)b(+)cdt(-), a(+)b(-)cdt(+), and a(+)b(+)cdt(+). c. botulinum toxin genes were not detected in fecal samples from cattle, but the gene for toxin b was detected in 1 (0.8%) of 125 dust samples. y. enterocolitica genes were found in 6 (1.6%) of 382 fecal samples from three dairy farms and one beef cattle farm. this study revealed that c. difficile and y. enterocolitica are rare on cattle farms in bavaria, germany. in contrast to results of previous studies,  c. botulinum was not detected in fecal samples but was found very rarely in dust  samples from the cattle environment.

TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food

TI  == bacterial toxins induce sustained mrna expression of the silencing transcription  factor klf2 via inactivation of rhoa and rhophilin 1.
AB  == yersiniae bearing the yersinia virulence plasmid pyv impact the transcriptome of  j774a.1 macrophage-like cells in two distinct ways: (i) by suppressing, in a yersinia outer protein p (yopp)-dependent manner, the induction of inflammatory response genes and (ii) by mrna induction of the silencing transcription factor klf2. here we show that klf2 induction by yersinia enterocolitica occurs in several cell lines of macrophage and squamous and upper gastrointestinal epithelial origin as well as in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. several strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are equally effective as y. enterocolitica in inducing klf2 expression. screening of mutant strains or  incubation with recombinant toxins identified the rho-inactivating toxins yopt from yersinia spp., exos from pseudomonas aeruginosa, edin-b from staphylococcus  aureus, and c3bot from clostridium botulinum as bacterial inducers of klf2 mrna.  klf2 mrna induction by these toxins does not require de novo protein synthesis. serum response factor or actin depolymerization does not seem to be involved in regulating klf2 expression in response to bacterial infection. instead, short hairpin rna-mediated inactivation of rhoa and its effector rhophilin 1 is sufficient to induce long-term klf2 expression. thus, bacteria exploit the rhoa-rhophilin signaling cascade to mediate sustained expression of the immunosuppressive transcription factor klf2.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  == aim: to develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (rdb) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. methods: the 12 intestinal pathogens tested were salmonella spp., brucella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, clostridium botulinum, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, vibrio parahaemolyticus, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the two universal primers were  designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16s and 23s rdna genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved rdb assay. results: the methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 cfus. the consistent detection rate of the improved rdb assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. conclusion: the hybridization results indicated that the improved rdb assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.

TI  == foodborne zoonoses due to meat: a quantitative approach for a comparative risk assessment applied to pig slaughtering in europe.
AB  == foodborne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrialised countries. new european food safety regulations were issued to apply risk analysis to the food chain. the severity of foodborne zoonoses and the exposure of humans to biological hazards transmitted by food must be assessed. for meat, inspection at  the slaughterhouse is historically the main means of control to protect consumers. however, the levels of detection of biological hazards during meat inspection have not been established in quantitative terms yet. pork is the most  frequently consumed meat in europe. the aim of this study was to provide elements for quantifying levels of risk for pork consumers and lack of detection by meat inspection. information concerning hazard identification and characterisation was obtained by the compilation and statistical analysis of data from 440 literature  references. the incidence and severity of human cases due to pork consumption in  europe were assessed in order to calculate risk scores. a ratio of non-control was calculated for each biological hazard identified as currently established in  europe, i.e. the incidence of human cases divided by the prevalence of hazards on pork. salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter spp. were characterised by high incidence rates. listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum and mycobacterium spp. showed the highest severity scores. the three main high risk hazards involved in foodborne infections, y. enterocolitica, s. enterica and campylobacter spp. are characterised by high non-control ratios and  cannot be detected by macroscopic examination of carcasses. new means of hazard control are needed to complement the classical macroscopic examination.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == [notification according to the law for protection against infections].
AB  == since january 1st 2001, the law for protection against infections decrees the duty of notification along two tracks, on the one hand by notification of infectious diseases and on the other hand by reporting the pathogens. however, the names of pathogens change due to scientific progress. furthermore, these names include in some cases not only harmful agents of infectious diseases but also inoffensive organisms, i. e. giardia lamblia. there are also problems in the notification of other pathogens such as brucella sp., campylobacter sp., chlamydia psittaci,clostridium botulinum, cryptosporidium parvum, leptospira interrogans, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar agents, norwalk-like viruses, salmonella paratyphi, treponema pallidum, trichinella spiralis and pathogenic serovars of yersinia enterocolitica. finally, the abandonment of notification for glanders, lymphogranuloma venereum, ulcus molle and variola appears to be risky, the reasons being partly unconvincing and  contradictory.

TI  == foodborne diseases in kenya.
AB  == objectives: to determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. design: cross-sectional survey. setting: forty two districts in kenya between 1970 and 1993. study subjects: foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens,  clostridium botulinum, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. outcome measures: number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. results: thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the ministry of health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. a high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. conclusion: under-reporting, inadequate investigation  of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease  outbreaks are more than is recorded by the ministry of health.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == indicative and pathogenic microbiological quality of aquacultured finfish grown in different production systems.
AB  == the nature and number of indicator and pathogenic microbes in fish reared using recirculating and nonrecirculating water systems were compared. for each system,  20 samples of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), tilapia (oreochromis spp.), hybrid striped bass (morone saxatilis x m. chrysops), and pacu (piaractus mesopotamicus) were randomly selected and gutted, and microbial analyses were performed using aoac procedures. five fish were subsampled and analyzed for indicative microbial quality with 3m petrifilm (). the general microbial quality  differed significantly (p < 0.05) among the production systems, except for total  coliform counts. rainbow trout cultured in recirculating and nonrecirculating water systems had lower counts for aerobes (2.00 to 3.11 log cfu/g) (p < 0.05), than other species, whereas trout reared in a recirculating water system had significantly lower psychrotrophic numbers (0.86 to 1.85 log cfu/g). pacu had the highest fecal coliform counts (2.74 to 3.70 log cfu/g), whereas hybrid striped bass and rainbow trout grown in nonrecirculating systems had lower fecal coliform counts (0.00 to 1.39 log cfu/g). rainbow trout grown in a nonrecirculating system had significantly higher escherichia coli counts (0.00 to 2.11 log cfu/g). the human bacterial pathogens listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. were not isolated form the fish sampled. however, clostridium botulinum botulinum was isolated from all the aquacultured fish sampled except pacu and tilapia grown in a recirculating aquaculture system. however, the counts were very low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.3 mpn/g.

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

TI  == [effectiveness of modified atmospheres against psychrotrophic pathogenic microorganisms in proteinaceous food].
AB  == modified atmosphere packaging (map) of proteinaceous raw foods (meat, poultry and fish) extends their shelf-lives. it is well established that modified atmospheres (ma) inhibit the psychotropic aerobic gram-negative bacteria, the main spoilage microflora of proteinaceous raw foods stored under refrigeration. several researchers have warned about the possible growth of food poisoning microorganisms on them. considering the minimal growth temperatures of pathogens, this review only deals with aeromonas hydrophila, clostridium botulinum, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. c. botulinum produces its toxin in many different atmospheres, but it is unable to grow at temperatures below 3.3 degrees c, and its production rate of the toxin at temperatures below 4.5 degrees c is very low, to the extent that fish can be spoiled before the toxin is detected. therefore, the control of the storage temperature of map fish seems to  be indispensable to assure the absence of botulinal toxin. with regard to the other pathogens, vacuum is the atmosphere that may support more readily its growth; the higher the co2 concentration in the atmosphere, the lower the growth  rate is. some investigations have shown that the growth rates of the psychotropic pathogens in map are lower than those of the spoilage flora. it has been shown also that a. hydrophila and l. monocytogenes growth rates are lower under ma than under aerobic storage. in relation to y. enterocolitica, more investigations should be carried out in order to clear up its behaviour, because the available data in the literature are still confusing and sometimes even contradictory. in conclusion, there are no evidences that support the concern about map of proteinaceous raw foods representing a greater hazard than its conventional storage under air.

TI  == enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (sids) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. serum samples from the sids infants were also analysed for these toxins. a significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of sids babies than in samples from the comparative group. these toxins were also found in serum from the sids babies. clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 sids cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); c. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 sids cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 sids cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies  (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); c. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 sids cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and bacillus cereus were not detected. heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (hlml) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 sids faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 sids faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 sids serum samples. c. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 sids faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 sids serum samples. c. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 sids faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%)  of 87 sids serum samples. c. difficile toxin was detected in four sids faecal samples and two serum samples. c. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 sids faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. staphylococcal  enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 sids faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 sids  serum samples.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.
