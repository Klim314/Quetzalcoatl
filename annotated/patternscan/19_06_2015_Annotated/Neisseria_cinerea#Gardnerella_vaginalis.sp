TI  == identification of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the microscan haemophilus-neisseria identification panel.
AB  == the haemophilus-neisseria identification (hnid) panel (american microscan, sacramento, calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of haemophilus and neisseria spp., branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, and gardnerella vaginalis. the hnid panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and hnid identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. in addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the hnid data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. the hnid panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 g. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28  neisseria lactamica strains and 48 b. catarrhalis strains. only 64.7% of 68 neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. among the haemophilus  spp., 98.8% of 83 h. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 h. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. eight strains of neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for b. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae. isolates of other species not included in the data base, including eikenella corrodens, kingella spp., and cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique  biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species,  and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and  utility of the hnid panel.
