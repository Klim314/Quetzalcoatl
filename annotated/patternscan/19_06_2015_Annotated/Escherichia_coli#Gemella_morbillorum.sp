TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == molecular analysis of oral and respiratory bacterial species associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == trauma intensive care unit (ticu) patients requiring mechanical respiratory support frequently develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). oral and oropharyngeal bacteria are believed to be responsible for many cases of vap, but  definitive evidence of this relationship is lacking. earlier studies used conventional culture-based methods for identification of bacterial pathogens, but these methods are insufficient, as some bacteria may be uncultivable or difficult to grow. the purpose of this study was to use a culture-independent molecular approach to analyze and compare the bacterial species colonizing the oral cavity  and the lungs of ticu patients who developed vap. bacterial samples were acquired from the dorsal tongue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 16 patients. bacterial dna was extracted, and the 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned into escherichia coli, and sequenced. the sequencing data revealed the following: (i)  a wide diversity of bacterial species in both the oral and pulmonary sites, some  of them novel; (ii) known and putative respiratory pathogens colonizing both the  oral cavity and lungs of 14 patients; and (iii) a number of bacterial pathogens (e.g., dialister pneumosintes, haemophilus segnis, gemella morbillorum, and pseudomonas fluorescens) in lung samples that had not been reported previously at this site when culture-based methods were used. our data indicate that the dorsal surface of the tongue serves as a potential reservoir for bacterial species involved in vap. furthermore, it is clear that the diversity of bacterial pathogens for vap is far more complex than the current literature suggests.

TI  == microaerophilic streptococcal infection in children.
AB  == a total of 148 isolates of microaerophilic streptococci (ms) (47 streptococcus constellatus, 43 streptococcus intermedius and five gemella morbillorum) were cultured from 123 children. there were predisposing conditions in 47 (38%) patients of which most common were previous surgery (14), trauma (11), malignancy (9) diabetes (6) and immunodeficiency (5). ms were the only bacteria isolated from 12 (10%) patients and mixed infections were encountered in 111, when the number of isolates varied between two and seven (average 3.0) isolates per specimen. the bacteria most commonly isolated with ms were anaerobic cocci (70 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (54), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (34) and escherichia coli (26). most b. fragilis and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections, and those of skin and soft tissue adjacent to the rectum. most pigmented prevotella and fusobacteria were isolated  from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, head and neck sites. most ms were recovered from abscesses (43%), the abdominal cavity (17%), sinuses (10%) and chest infections (9%). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients, in 61 this was combined with surgical drainage or correction. three patients died. these data illustrate that ms can occasionally be associated with infection in children.
