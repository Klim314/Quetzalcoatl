nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.
characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
background: lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri. results: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) fraction (47 out of 90). lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of lactobacillus positive infants) of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and muc7, and purified mfgm, and adhered to epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in 29.7% of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri (2.14 pg/ul) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/ul) or mfgm (0.697 pg/ul) formula. conclusions: lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.
antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.
antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
the objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesives used were corega ultra((r)), fixodent pro original((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip. for streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mutans, four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. in addition four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml without any denture adhesive was employed as control. for prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml without adhesive served as control. all samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. after 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/ml. the results were evaluated with anova on ranked data and tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. however, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. corega ultra((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than fixodent pro original((r)).
garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.
antibacterial compounds from siraitia grosvenorii leaves.
luo han guo (lhg) fruits (siraitia grosvenorii swingle) have been used as traditional medicine in china for centuries to treat sore throats and coughs. however, lhg leaves are seldom used and minimal scientific information is available on them. in our recent study on the leaves of s. grosvenorii, the bioactive compounds beta-amyrin (2), aloe emodin (5), aloe-emodin acetate (6), 5alpha,8alpha-epidioxy-24(r)-methylcholesta-6,22-dien-3beta-ol (7) and p-hydroxyl benzyl acid (8), accompanied by n-hexadecaoic acid (1), 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (3), beta-sitosterol (4) and daucosterol (9) were first obtained. their structures have been identified on the basis of spectroscopic studies. the activities of these compounds were evaluated in vitro against the growth of oral bacterial species streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and the yeast candida albicans, and their minimum inhibition concentrations were determined. furthermore, the activity against s. mutans is likely to be due to the inhibition of glucosyltransferase. the experimental data provide important information on bioactive phytochemicals in the leaf of s. grosvenorii, which shows that the leaf can be a new resource as an antibacterial agent.
[characterization and antibacterial effect of ag-nha-ntio2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
objective: undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (ag-nha-ntio2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (pa66) by co-polymerization method. the purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. methods: the morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (aas), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (edx). staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. results: xrd results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (ha). a homogeneous distribution of the ca, p, ti and ag element in the membrane was confirmed by edx. both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by sem and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. the bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of s. aureus and 56.31% of e. coli were killed. however, 91.84% of p. gingivalis, 90.64% of f. nucleatum and 90.49% of s. mutans were killed and pictures of sem showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. conclusion: the nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
pcr method is essential for detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. m. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. to evaluate the risk of m. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of m. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the detection rates by pcr in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. the detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. m. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. strains of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of m. tuberculosis, but strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. the present study concludes that the pcr method is essential for detecting m. tuberculosis in oral samples.
3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.
the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used, but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
[ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
this study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. bacterial strains used in this study, were fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mutans omz 176. the bacterial cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-k1, l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (n2: 80%, co2: 10%, h2: 10%). the effect of environmental eh and ph on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and eh and ph tolerance tests were also undertaken. the environmental ph decreased from ph 7.0 to ph 4.9 accompanied with the growth of s. mutans omz 176 and s. sanguis atcc 10557 in both single and mixed culture. the environmental eh increased from -308 mv to -180 mv accompanied with the growth of s. sanguis atcc 10557. the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with eh and ph. especially, the growth of p. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below ph 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 was strongly inhibited at eh -100 mv in an eh tolerance test. the oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of s. sanguis atcc 10557. therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by s. sanguis atcc 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. these results suggest that the high eh and the low ph generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.
lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
similar to streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. for lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at phs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate. for f. nucleatum suspended at ph 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/l bicarbonate activation. when lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, ph 5.3, lysis was observed only with l. plantarum and s. mutans, but not with l. casei. the latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. in experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for l. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to salivary factors other than lysozyme. f. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral ph, suggesting that both gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.
inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
