TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. A total of 545 clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2013. MICs were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampC genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Flomoxef showed excellent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. Moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/mL. Flomoxef showed MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/0.5 mug/mL against MSSA, 0.125/0.25 mug/mL against S. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/mL against S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis and was also potent against MSSA, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis and its role in dacryocystitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Dacryocystitis is a common inflammation of the lacrimal sac, usually from an underlying bacterial infection. Most cases can be attributed to common ocular flora such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae; however, uncommon bacterial causes such as Proteus mirabilis can still occur. P. mirabilis is a gram-negative bacillus that is found abundantly in people who have undergone long-term catheterization and is uncommonly found in or around the eyes except in people who have undergone long-term catheterization. Proteus species can cause conjunctivitis, canaliculitis, and dacryocystitis and have the ability to manifest into preseptal cellulitis; therefore, timely recognition and treatment are important to prevent potential further complications. CASE REPORT: An 84-year-old white man had several recurrences of acute dacryocystitis that had marginal improvement with empiric antibiotic treatment. Resultant culture of the ocular discharge revealed an uncommon bacterium, P. mirabilis. Successful dosing of oral antibiotics resolved the infection but ultimately the patient required an external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) procedure to maintain patency of the nasolacrimal lacrimal system and prevent recurrence. At 3 months after external DCR, the patient was symptom free with no recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Dacryocystitis has a distinctive clinical presentation and is usually easily treated when appropriate oral antibiotics are directed at the underlying pathogen. In nonresponsive cases, culturing of the ocular discharge should be performed to identify the underlying pathogen. Cases of dacryocystitis caused by Proteus species are usually responsive to several standard antibiotics used orally in eye care; however, culturing and susceptibility testing can streamline the diagnostic and management sequence considerably in unclear or unresponsive cases. Typically, patients with dacryocystitis return to normal after appropriate treatment, but chronic recurrences and epiphora are potential sequelae. Patients should be educated that a DCR surgical procedure may be needed to prevent future recurrences in some cases.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles green-synthesized  using pineapple leaf (Ananas comosus).
AB  - Pineapple leaf was used in this study for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles based on the search for sustainable synthetic means. Indeed, this offered an economical and sustainable synthetic route relative to expensive and toxic chemical methods. The leaf extract was used and the corresponding nanoparticles obtained were subjected to UV-vis analysis at different times. The UV-vis was used to monitor the silver nanoparticle formation through sampling at time intervals. The formation of silver nanoparticles was apparently displayed within 2 min with evidence of surface plasmon bands (SPB) between 440 and 460 nm. The crystals was equally characterized using FTIR, X-ray diffraction methods and TEM. The different results obtained suggested the appearance of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) as determined by the process parameters with a particle size of 12.4 nm. The sample was further screened against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli using Gentamicin as control. From the results, there is evidence of inhibition towards bacteria growth. It can now be inferred from the studies that biosynthesis of nanoparticles could be a gateway to our numerous health issues.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In-Vitro, Anti-Bacterial Activities of Aqueous Extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and Shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in Persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. METHODS: The well diffusion method (KB testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. RESULTS: A particular combination of Acacia catechu (L.F.) Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an outstanding anti-bacterial activity. It's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is significant when compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. The highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (Table1). CONCLUSION: The results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of Acacia catechu, Castanea sativa husk, Ephedra sp. and Mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in formula number 2 (ASLAN()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. These results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  - Hydramacin-1 (HM1) from the metazoan Hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. Notably, HM1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. To date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. Here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of HM1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. The high binding constants of HM1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain SWT(K/R) motifs. The residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 A and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. Our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. Furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by HM1 was observed for a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.
TI  - Serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of SSIs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is still high. An improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. Serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: After single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. We found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Report: Studies on antibacterial activity of some traditional medicinal plants used in folk medicine.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of eight medicinal plants commonly used in folk medicine were  tested for their antibacterial activity against four Gram positive strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and six Gram negative strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis. Salmonella typhi para A, Salmonella typhi para B and Shigella dysenteriae) that were obtained from different pathological laboratories located in Karachi, Pakistan. Disc diffusion method was used to analyze antibacterial activity. Out of eight, five medicinal plants showed antibacterial activity against two or more than two microbial species. The most effective antimicrobial plant found to be Punica granatum followed by Curcuma zedoaria Rosc, Grewia asiatica L and Carissa carandas L, Curcuma caesia Roxb respectively. From these results, it is evident that medicinal plants could be used as a potential source of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - [Epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Iasi, Romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  - Infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 at The Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). Cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. RESULTS: From 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. Severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high Charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). There were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated, being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci (14/18,66%), Enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group B Streptococcus (3/4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus equi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). Multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. Meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of S. aureus. Among 16 invazive strains of E. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. There were no E. coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. The mean mortality rate was 14,66%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance of S. aureus and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. Proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Confirmation of HIV-like sequences in respiratory tract bacteria of Cambodian and Kenyan HIV-positive pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and yeasts isolated from respiratory tracts of 39 Cambodian  and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children were tested for the presence of HIV-1 sequences. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract (nose, pharyngeal swabs) were isolated from 39 Cambodian and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children. Bacterial chromosomal DNA was prepared by standard protocol and by Qiagen kit. The PCR specific for HIV sequences was carried out using HIV-1-specific primers.The analysis was performed by colony and dot-blot hybridization using HIV-1-specific primers which represent gag, pol and env genes of the virus. The sequencing of some PCR products was performed on the ABI 373 DNA Sequencer. RESULTS: The majority of microbes were characterized as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resp. Candida albicans. In some cases E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Candida tropicalis were identified. Bacteria of 16 Cambodian (41%) and 8 Kenyan (31%) children were found to be positive in colony and dot-blot DNA hybridization. By the sequencing of PCR products synthesized on the template of patients' bacterial DNA using primers 68;69 for env HIV-1 gene, homology of greater than 90% with HIV-1 isolate HXB2 (HIVHXB2CG) was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract of 41% of Cambodian and 31% of Kenyan HIV-positive children bear HIV-like sequences. The role of bacteria in the HIV disease process is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Autoimmune diseases: Solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  - Autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. These are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. Here we describe these components and how they interact. Known microbial triggers are Streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, Proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and Klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. The immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is caused by loss of suppressor T cells. This leaves Burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in Graves' disease, as the immunological defect. With wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. This dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (H Gene Theory). We show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. Because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically. Isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. Kaplans's discovery that xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.
TI  - Microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.
TI  - Microbiological findings in prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to define the most common causes, symptoms and clinical  features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls, and to evaluate treatment success depending on the causative agent involved. The study included 115 girls aged 2-8 (mean 4.8) years, presenting with vulvovaginitis to the Outpatient Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, Zagreb Children's Hospital, between September 2006 and July 2007. Medical history data were obtained from parents. Vaginal samples were collected for microbiological culture by using cotton-tipped swabs moistened with saline. All samples were referred to microbiology laboratory, where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. Selective and non-selective media were used. Of 115 study patients, 43 (37.4%) had received antibiotic therapy more than one month prior to their visit to the Clinic, mainly for upper respiratory tract infection. The most common presenting symptom was increased vaginal discharge usually noticed on the pants or diaper, found in 26 of 115 (22.6%) patients, followed by vulvar redness in 16 (13.9%), burning in seven (6.1%), itching in the vulvovaginal area in seven (6.1%), soreness in six (5.2%), odor in three (2.6%) patients, and two or more of these symptoms in another 50 (43.5%) patients. Fifty-nine of 115 children had normal clinical finding on gynecologic examination. Among the remaining 56 children, the most common finding was erythema observed in 19, vaginal discharge in ten, and a combination of discharge and erythema in 13 patients. Of 115 study patients, causative agents were isolated from vaginal culture in 38 (33%) cases. Of these, 21 grew group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, five patients Haemophilus influenzae, three Escherichia coli, two Enterococcus spp., and one each Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 31 of these 38 patients, except for those cases where intestinal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated and topical therapy and hygienic measures were applied alone. Accordingly, vulvovaginitis in girls was most commonly caused by pathogens originating from the patient upper respiratory tract, accompanied by the symptoms of redness and vaginal discharge. In these cases, antibiotic treatment was administered. In the majority of prepubertal girls with either vulvitis or normal genital finding, simple measures to improve hygiene will lead to resolution of all symptoms.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity, phenol and flavonoid contents of Thespesia  populnea flower extracts.
AB  - Flavonoids which were reported as having many pharmacological activities, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, chemoprevention activities and they possess strong antiproliferative effects related to inhibition of cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction. On the basis of this Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. Ex Correa (Family-Malvaceae) was selected and it is having the major composition of flavonoids and the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers was investigated by agar well diffusion method. Furthermore our phytochemical studies indicated that methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers contains flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and anthroquinone glycosides. Moreover the individual components were identified by thin layer chromatography and Rf value was compared with standard flavonoid quercetin. The total phenolic and flavonoid content studies were also quantified. The bacteria used for antibacterial study were Shigella flexneri (NCIM 4924), Rhodococcus terrae (NCIM 5126), Escherichiae coli (ATCC 11775), Streptococcus faecalis (NCIB 2406), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883),Brevibacterium luteum (NCIM 2923), Micrococcus flavum (NCIM 2376), Proteus mirabilis (NCIB 8268), Bacillus licheniformis (NCIM 2468), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 2984), Flavobacterium devorans (NCIM 2581), Shigella sonei(ATCC 29930), Shigella boydii (ATCC 8700) and Shigella dysentriae (ATCC 13313).According to our results in the lowest tested concentration of 62.5 microg/ml and 125mug/ml 7.2% of the plant extract were active, 5% active in the concentration of 250 microg/ml, 75.7% active in the concentration of 500 microg/ml and 92.8% active at the concentration of 1000 microg/ml in a dose dependent manner.
TI  - [Evaluation of effectiveness and tolerance of treatment with azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Azithromycin is a macrolide class antibiotic, recently adapted for  topical use in ophthalmology. It is effective against the most frequent pathogens found in bacterial conjunctivitis, Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Azithromycin has the specificity to have sustained high tissue levels: after repeated instillation, it has been shown to reach sustained concentrations above the MICs of susceptible bacteria for 4 days in tears and for 7 days in conjunctiva. THE AIM OF STUDY: To investigate the effectiveness and tolerance of treatment with Azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in bacterial conjunctivitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective study included 40 patients (69 eyes) with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis; aged 21-70 years; average: 38.05 Patients were treated with 1.5% azithromycin eye drops topically twice-daily for 3 days. Conjunctival swabbings were taken at the 1st and the 7th +/- 1 day of the treatment. Effectiveness and tolerance of eye drops were assessed in 7th +/- 1 day from the beginning of the treatment. RESULTS: Bacteriological cultures were positive before treatment in 34 eyes (49.28%), negative--35 eyes (50.72%). In 69 eyes with bacterial conjunctivitis the following microorganisms were identyfied (34 eyes): Streptococcus pneumoniae 23.53% (8 eyes), Staphyllococcus aureus 23.53% (8 eyes), Staphyllococcus epidermidis 20.59% (7 eyes), Haemophilus influenzae 17.65% (6 eyes), Morganella Morgani 2.94% (1 eye), Proteus mirabilis 2.94% (1 eye), Enterococcus species 2.94% (1 eye), Streptococcus viridians 2.94% (1 eye), Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis 2.94% (1 eye). Positive bacteriological culture at the 7th day of treatment--2 eyes (1 eye--Staphyllococcus epidermidis MSCNS, 1 eye--Morganella Morgani). Clinical recovery or significant improvement were observed in 68 of 69 evaluated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Three-day topical therapy with azithromycin 1.5% eye drops is an effective and well tolerated therapy for purulent bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Surveillance of intrahospital infections at the clinic for gynaecology and obstetrics.
AB  - Intrahospital infections (IHI) and antibiotics resistance are the problems which  exist in virtually all hospitals in the world. The main aim of the present research is establishing of epidemiological surveillance over occurrence of IHI at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Clinical Center Tuzla and thus identifies: types of bacteria which cause IHI, types of infection according to anatomical localization and research resistance organisms causing of IHI on antimicrobial drugs. A study was implemented on all patients admitted to Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the period of one year and who subsequently developed infection. Determination of intrahospital infections was done according to criteria defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from the United States. The results of our work have shown that both urinary tract infections and surgical site infections are the most frequent. As IHI causers the most found are gram-negative organisms (73,7%), such as Escherichia coli (29,8%), right after that Klebsiella pneumoniae (24,6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,3%) (p<0,05). Gram-positive organisms as causers of IHI are registered in 26,3% cases. Out of that Streptococcus species are isolated in 10,5% cases, Staphylococcus aureus (8,8%) and coagulasa negative staphylococci (7%) (p>0,05). High percent resistance of bacteria was evident to beta-lactams, aminoglycosids and cephalosporin's of third generation. Gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to vancomycin, while gram-negative organisms manifested the high percent of sensibility to imipenem and cefepime.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem in US medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of MYSTIC program surveillance.
AB  - Since 1997, the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the United States, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 Enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, and 829 Gram-positive cocci. All isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. Meropenem (MIC(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/mL) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against Enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). KPC carbapenemases, usually found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. Meropenem remained active against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; MIC(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/mL). These US MYSTIC Program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against Enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial intrahospital infections in newborns].
AB  - Nosocomial infections are important problem for the modern medicine. Especially sensitive category, susceptible to nosocomial infections, are the infants. The aim of the research was to establish an active monitoring over the breaking out of the nosocomial infections in the Neonatology Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of the University Clinical Center Tuzla (UKC) and to determine the kind of bacteria that causes the nosocomial infections as well as the type of infection according to anatomical localization. The research encompassed 8000 of newborn infants at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in the years 2005 and 2006. The determining of the nosocomial infections was done by using the standard CDC criteria. The results show that in two researching years the leading nosocomial infections were bacteriemia, followed by other infections, respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The mostly identified carrier of the nosocomial infections in 2005 were gram-positive bacteria (65,5%): coagulase-negative staphylococci was isolated in 54,6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5,5% and Streptococcus species in 5,5% of cases (p<0,001). The isolated gram-negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2005 were Klebisiella pneumoniae (21,8%), Escherichia coli (5,5%), Pseudomanas aeruginosa (3,6%) and Morganella morganii (3,6%) (p<0,05). In 2006 the mostly identified and isolated carriers of nosocomial infections were gram positive bacteria (64,2%): coagulase-negative Staphylococci (43,3%), Streptococcus species (13,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7,5%) (p<0,001). Gram negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2006 were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19,4%), Escherichia coli (10,5%), Acinetobacter species (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,5%) and Proteus mirabilis (1,5%) (p<0,05). The bacteriemia was mostly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Infections of the urinary tract were caused by gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Other infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Infections of the respiratory tract were caused by Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most frequent carriers of the nosocomial infections at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in 2005 and 2006 was gram-positive bacteria-coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates from primary care clinics to oral antibacterial agents].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates from specimens of patients  in primary care clinics in 2005 was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral antibacterial agents. The numbers of test strains were 550 for Gram-positive aerobes, 700 for Gram-negative aerobes, and 150 for anaerobes. Cefcapene (CFPN), cefditoren (CDTR), and cefteram (CFTM) showed the most potent activities against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. among the cephems tested and moxifloxacin (MFLX) and tosufloxacin among the new quinolones. Although the new quinolones generally showed potent activities against these species, resistant strains were frequently detected in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, 70% or more of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were intermediate or resistant to macrolides. Cephems showed good activities against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria except for Proteus spp. Specifically, CFPN, CDTR, and CFTM showed the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae among the cephems tested. The new quinolones showed potent activities against Gram-negative bacteria, especially H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not against Proteus mirabilis and Providencia spp. When compared with the susceptibilities of clinical isolates from tertiary care hospitals, found in other research, differences were noted, for example, there was a lower frequency of quinolone-resistant strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus but a higher frequency of macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, to accurately grasp susceptibility trends, well-focused surveillance studies are necessary.
TI  - [Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in bronchiectatic patients and clinical reflections].
AB  - Bronchiectasis is characterized with irreversible dilatation according to destruction of epithelium, elastic and muscular layer. Most important cause of bronchiectasis is chronic bacterial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation is frequently seen in bronchiectatic patients. We aimed to find out P. aeruginosa colonisation frequency and clinical, radiological and spirometric reflections due to colonisation. We analysed 83 cases retrospectively. Mean age was 58.2 and 54.2% of them were female. Bronchiectasis were localised 19.3% in left lung, 19.3% right and 61.4% bilaterally. 29 (35.8%) normal, 28 (34.6%) obstructive, 7 (8.6%) restrictive, 17 (21%) mixed type disorders are detected in spirometric measures. Sputum culture performed in 50 cases. No microorganism colonisation determined in 30 (60%) cases, P. aeruginosa colonisation 16 (32%), Haemophilus influenzae 2 (4%), 1 (2%) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis 1 (2%) cases. P. aeruginosa colonisation determined more frequent in males (p<0.05). No significant correlation detected between colonisation and age or smoking habits (p>0.05). In cases with colonisation; clubbing and hemoptysis were significantly frequent (p<0.05). Only peribronchial thickening was significantly correlated with colonisation in radiological findings (p<0.05). In blood gase analysis PaO2, oxygen saturation were lower and PaCO2 higher in cases colonised with P. aeruginosa but it was not statisticaly significant (p>0.05). Hospitalization rate was higher in P. aeruginosa colonised cases (p>0.05). It is an important problem about mortality because of higher hemoptysis and hospitalisation requirement rate in P. aeruginosa colonised cases.
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - There is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) presenting with symptoms of UTI have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their PBS/IC symptoms. One hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed IC were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. At the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (Bard 14Fr female) and cultured for bacteria. Eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. Once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of PBS/IC was confirmed. A pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (PUF) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. After the diagnosis of PBS/IC, all patients received multimodal treatment. Patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of UTI, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. Greater than 10(3) colonies were considered positive. Patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. Seventy-two patients (68%) had no UTI episodes or flares. The remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54 flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. A single flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). Recurrent UTI symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. Of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). Therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). Nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (n = 6), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and Citrobacter sp. (n = 1). One grew Streptococcus sp. There was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or PUF scores between groups. This study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed UTIs in a large group of PBS/IC patients followed longitudinally. These data suggest that only a small number of PBS/IC patients with UTI symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). Although the symptoms of recurrent UTI are prevalent in IC patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent UTIs is only 6.6%. Because the flares of IC are usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. These data suggest that the symptom flares of IC are not usually associated with recurrent UTI and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in IC patients who are culture-negative.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - [Infectious spondylodiscitis in a health area of Galicia (Spain) from 1983-2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of infectious spondylodiscitis (IS) in adults of our health area in the late 20 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of adult patients with a diagnosis of both, tuberculous (TS) and non tuberculous spondylodiscitis (NTS), between January 1983 and December 2003. The diagnosis was made when compatible clinical-radiological picture were present in association with at least two positive blood cultures and/or micro-organism recovery from vertebral samples. Additionally, TS was diagnosed when biopsy showed typical caseating granulomas from vertebral or extra-vertebral lesions. RESULTS: 17 TS and 22 NTS were identified. The mean age was lower in patients with TS than in NTS (43.5 +/- 24.6 vs 52.0 +/- 15.2 years; mean +/- SD). Patients were predominantly males in both, TS (57%) and NTS (82%; p < 0001). The time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis was longer in TS (16.4 +/- 15.2 weeks) than in NTS (3.9 +/- 3.2 weeks), p= 0.005. Seven (41%) of the 17 patients with TS had active extra-vertebral tuberculosis. A source of infection was presumed in 20 NTS (90%), mainly surgical spinal procedures (9/22.41%). In three TS and four NTS one o more predisposing factors were observed. The patients with NTS presented a higher prevalence of fever (41 vs 24%; p= 0.0003) and leucocytosis (41 vs 12%; p < 0.001), but less neurological impairment (9 vs 21% p= 0,01). None patient with NTS presented mixed infection and Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen (14/22.64%) follows by Streptococcus sp (6/22.27%). Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were the remain causative agents. Spinal cord decompression and surgical drainage of abscess were performed in five patients (24%) with TS and four patients with NTS (18%), p= 0.0027). Neurological sequels were more common in the patients with TS (24 vs 14%, p= 0.008). The global incidence of IS was 2.2 cases/105 inhabitants/year, which 1.73 cases are NTS. CONCLUSIONS: The IS are a unusual disease what occurs predominantly in male patients. In the last 10 years, a increasing prevalence of NTS was observed, with high contribution (41%) of post-surgical cases. Diagnostic delay is greater in patients with TS and this condition was associated with more neurological sequels.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - [Chronic carriers of pathogen conjunctival bacteria. Possible risks in cataract surgery].
AB  - PURPOSE: To ascertain the frequency and characteristics of chronic carriers of conjunctival pathogen bacteria among patients undergoing cataract surgery in our hospital, to allow the design of studies of their postsurgical endophthalmitis risk. METHODS: Retrospective study of the preoperative conjunctival flora of 784 patients operated on for cataracts in both eyes, in two operations separated by 213 days (SD 170), from November 1993 to December 1997. Results of both cultures for each patient were obtained from the Laboratory cataract preoperative database, by means of an auxiliary utility in dBASE-III-PLUS program. The preoperative bacteria in both surgeries were compared and the patients having the same pathogen bacteria (all except Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Corynebacterium sp.) were identified. The mean values and standard deviations were calculated using Epiinfo 6.04, and the Chi2 test was carried out using Excel 97. RESULTS: The conjunctival flora stemming from the first preoperative culture of the 784 patients were statistically similar to those of our reference population. The pathogen bacteria decreased in the second preoperative culture; especially the Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Haemophilus sp. frequencies (p<0.05). The same pathogen was isolated in both cultures of 31 patients among the 784 who entered the study, Staphylococcus Aureus and Proteus Mirabilis being the most frequent colonizers. The mean age of those carriers was higher than the mean age of the reference population (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 3.95% of our patients awaiting cataract surgery are usual conjunctival carriers of certain pathogen bacteria; this finding is associated with the age of the patients and possibly with some pre-existing diseases.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. In this study the activity of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. Subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. Moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC of moxifloxacin. In conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. We created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 January, 1990 through 31 December, 2000). Improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. During the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). The mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). The 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: Escherichia coli (1494), Staphylococcus aureus (1240), Klebsiella pneumoniae (779), Enterococcus spp. (631), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), Streptococcus pneumoniae (447), Enterobacter spp. (338), Acinetobacter spp. (298), Proteus mirabilis (260) and Candida spp. (254). No significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was E. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was Candida (1, 0.3). Forty percent of organisms (N=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ED), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (ICUs). Trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ED Enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the ICU isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. The difference in susceptibility between ED and ICU isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (P<0.001). A significant decrease in the susceptibility of E coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. In K. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of K. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. Pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. Susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (P<0.001). Marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. Trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Infestation of fish-culturing communities with fish-borne bacteria: the Ghanaian  case.
AB  - Twenty different bacterial species were isolated from fishermen and members of communities associated with seven fish ponds with different fertilizer treatments, and an open system. The number and types of the bacterial species were different for the different ponds. Generally, neither the geographical location of the ponds nor the type of fertilizer used could be related to the bacterial flora. Escherichia coli was the predominant species in all the communities, while Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp., Shigella sp. or Streptococcus faecalis were common in individuals of communities of sewage-fed pond.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  - Between January 1986 and December 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. To compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). In this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. Its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. Of the pathogens, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by Viridans (V.) streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Other rare organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella Group B and D, Proteus mirabilis, Group B, D, and non-A, non-B and non-D streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. There was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. Of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with V. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with K. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. The timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates to a Glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - The characterization of bacterial isolates from acute otitis media in Ile-Ife, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in a comprehensive healthcare setting was investigated in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Out of the 617 children examined, 53 (11.64 per cent) suffered from the condition based on the criteria used. Staphylococci constituted the predominant organisms associated with the condition with Staphylococcus aureus (25.0 per cent) being the most frequent single microbe recovered from the subjects. This was followed by Proteus mirabilis (16.2 per cent), Staphylococcus sp. (8.8 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae (7.4 per cent each). Most isolates tested were multiply resistant to the antibiotics commonly employed in treating infections caused by these organisms. The study highlights the prevalence of multi-resistant organisms amongst the subjects and recommends prompt therapeutic intervention to avert ineffectiveness of antibiotics when used in treating infections caused by these organisms in the community.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF THE LEAF EXTRACT OF Lagerstroemia parviflora Roxb.
AB  - The benzene extract of the leaves of Lagerstroemia paviflora Roxb was tested for  its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against Gram Positive Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition Produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic Ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the mycotoxin citrinin obtained from the fungus penicillium citrinum.
AB  - The mycotoxin Citrinin was obtained from the fungus Penicillium citrinum. It was  tested for it's Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against some gram positive strains viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtillis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition produced by the fungal extract against the bacterial strains were assayed and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. Thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (OE), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (AOM-TT) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. METHODS: A survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of quinolone otic products for OE, AOM-TT and CSOM. RESULTS: OE: Floxin otic and Cortisporin TC otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CSOM: Ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. AOM-TT: Ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa CONCLUSIONS: In each of the studies of OE, CSOM and AOM-TT, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to Cortisporin for children with OE; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with AOM-TT who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients with CSOM.
TI  - Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  - Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - Characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in Taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  - During the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. The ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. The male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. The most common causative agent was group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 31.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (20%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. Among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. In contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after seven days of age). Ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. The most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. Since 1991, GBS has overtaken E. coli as the leading cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis. This was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potency of the Leaf - Stalk Extract of Curcuma longa (LINN).
AB  - The methanolic extract of the leaf-stalk of curcuma longa LINN, was tested for its minimum Inhibitor concentration (MIC) against Gram positive-staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pnemoniae, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative E.coli, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and Vibrio cholerae strains, further, the ones of inhibition produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml. Difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect. After 24 hours of incubation at pH 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except Staphylococcus intermedius. Against S. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.
TI  - Intracranial complications of acute mastoiditis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral antibiotic use may have changed the incidence and microbiology of otitic intracranial complications. We reviewed cases of acute mastoiditis to document: (1) incidence of intracranial complications; (2) risk factors; and (3) identify pathologic organisms. METHODS: A retrospective study of children at a tertiary care children's hospital with acute mastoiditis from July, 1986 through June, 1998. RESULTS: 118 children with acute mastoiditis were identified. Eight patients (6.8%), ages 20 months to 14 years, had intracranial complications related to acute mastoiditis. Three children had a sigmoid sinus thrombosis, two children had an epidural abscess, and two children had both complications of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and epidural abscess, and a sigmoid sinus thrombosis and meningitis was present in one child. Pre-admission oral antibiotics were administered for an average of 10 days in seven of the eight patients. Persistent otorrhea and/or otalgia were present in all patients. Intraoperative cultures were negative in four cases (50%). Organisms isolated included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (2); Proteus mirabilis (1); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1); and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1). Multi-drug resistant organisms were documented in only one case. All patients underwent a contrast enhanced CT of the temporal bones and brain. Surgical management included complete mastoidectomy in all patients and a pressure equalization tube in seven of the eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not document an increase in the incidence of otitic intracranial complications. Persistent otalgia or otorrhea while on oral antibiotics with associated neurologic symptoms are ominous signs suggestive of a complication. Multi-drug resistant organisms are uncommon whereas negative intraoperative cultures are common.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, GAR-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GAR-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. A total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. Among the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, GAR-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. All enteric bacilli MIC90 results were < or = 4 microg/mL; the exception being Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (> or = 8 microg/mL). GAR-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a MIC90 of 8 and > 8 microg/mL for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. All Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/mL of GAR-936 (MIC90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/mL). Although GAR-936 (MIC50, 0.25 microg/mL) was two-fold less active than minocycline (MIC50, 0.12 microg/mL) against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/mL. GAR-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90, 2 microg/ml) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 microg/mL), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 8 microg/mL). Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 1-2 microg/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 microg/mL), and various Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.12-0.5 microg/mL) were susceptible to GAR-936. These results indicate that GAR-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to GAR-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: 11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with AS, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. The peripheral T cell receptor Vbeta repertoire was investigated using FACS analysis and 14 different Vbeta antibodies. In addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma ELISPOT assays. RESULTS: Twins suffering from AS showed cellular hyporeactivity against K pneumoniae, S pyogenes, C albicans in the ELISPOT assays compared with healthy twins. In contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, AS concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their Vbeta repertoire on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective T cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. There are probably other environmental factors that influence disease concordance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - [Lumbar puncture in a pediatric emergency department: something more than a diagnostic technic].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to know the incidence of serious bacterial infections (SBI) in children without sepsis or intracranial infection in which spinal puncture (LP) was performed in an Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all 471 previously healthy children between 1 month and 14 years of age in which a lumbar puncture was performed between July 1995 and March 1997 in the Emergency Department of our hospital was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and three children (43%) had sepsis, meningitis or encephalitis (aseptic meningitis 149, 31.6%; sepsis-bacterial meningitis 26, 5.5%; nonspecific meningitis 26, 5.5%; encephalitis 2, 0.4%) and 14 (5.2%) had pneumonia. Of the other 254 children, 36 (14.1%) had a SBI: 19 urinary tract infections (E. coli), 11 bacteremia (Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, Salmonella enteritidis 1, Proteus mirabilis 1, E. coli 1, the latter two also having a positive urine culture) and 6 bacterial gastroenteritis (salmonella 5, Campylobacter jejuni 1). The incidence of SBI was significantly higher in the group of children younger than 5 years old (32/175, 18.2%) than in the older group (4/79, 5.0%, p = 0.009). Two patients died (one with pneumococcal meningitis and one with meningococcal sepsis). CONCLUSIONS: Children with fever and a normal result in the LP must be carefully examined and, especially in younger patients, urine, blood and stool (if stool abnormalities) cultures should be collected. These children must be closely observed in the hospital or at home and must be re-evaluated by their pediatrician in the following 24 hours.
TI  - Bacteria in lung tissue from an autopsy population of alcoholics.
AB  - The retrieval of bacteria from the lungs postmortem was examined in a population  of alcoholics who had a medico-legal autopsy performed. The results were compared with non-alcoholic controls. Pneumococci were found more frequently in alcoholics, but in general there were no major differences. Proteus mirabilis was detected in three out of five alcoholics with unascertainable cause of death. It is speculated whether this species may cause septicaemia in some alcoholics due to abnormal splanchnicus circulation.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Airways microbial flora in COPD patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  - Patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. The precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. In the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. Thus, we performed fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with COPD, 16 with stable clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. Twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with COPD exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.mL-1). The predominant bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococcus viridans and Chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). Although significant bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - The role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. Because of perceived limitations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. Ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the treatment of chronic otitis media where P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. Quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. Recently published guidelines in Canada, USA and Great Britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring ICU admission. A quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. For patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. In the absence of P. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. Early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151 consecutive CSF bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. Treatment decisions associated with individual CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. Treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial therapy based on the reporting of CSF culture isolates. Thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. Three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from 34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (Candida tropicalis, Proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second CSF specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. Thus, only a single isolate (3%; Staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. In contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; Cryptococcus neoformans, 10; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; Streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). We conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from CSF specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of CSF broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - This study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. The anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. Then, the sample of ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. Thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. Fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. The cultural rate was 60.9%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus viridans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae. Conversely, only three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. The results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus more accurate.
TI  - A national collaborative study of the in vitro activity of oral cephalosporins and loracarbef (LY 163892). Australian Group for the Study of Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR).
AB  - A national collaborative study involving the laboratories of 17 Australian hospitals examined the in vitro activity of loracarbef, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate against 2661 recently isolated common bacterial pathogens. Loracarbef was the most active agent against Escherichia coli (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) and had activity comparable to other agents against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Like the oral cephalosporins, it had no activity against species of Enterobacter and Serratia. beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 8 mg/l for both species). Streptococcus pneumoniae was moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) but strains which were insensitive to penicillin were often highly resistant.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. At the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees C. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. The highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours and 0800 hours, prior to operation. When applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). These mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. CONCLUSION: Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. This fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomanas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum.
AB  - Ten sesquiterpene lactones and one sesquiterpene isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum: 1 alpha, 6 alpha -dihydroxyisocostic acid methyl ester (2), 1 alpha-hydroxy-1-deoxoarglanine (3), douglanin (5), santamarin (6), reynosin (7), 1-epitatridin B (8), ludovicin A (10), armexin (12), armefolin (13), armexifolin (14), and 3 alpha-hydroxyreynosin (15) were tested against the human lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 and the colorectal cancer cell line COLO 320 as well as against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, two germacranolides tatridin A (16) and tamirin (17) were included in the study. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 124 microM) but most of them were not effective in the antimicrobial tests.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  - In laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. The absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. In a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. In a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.
TI  - Lung abscess in patients with AIDS.
AB  - We identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and lung abscess. All patients had advanced HIV disease, and the mean CD4 cell count was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). The pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), P. carinii (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. Patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. The outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. In patients with AIDS, lung abscess is associated with advanced HIV infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Changing patterns of susceptibilities of blood, urinary and respiratory pathogens in Hong Kong.
AB  - The incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms isolated from blood,  urine and respiratory specimens at a teaching hospital in Hong Kong were studied retrospectively from 1986-1993. The incidence of Gram-positive bacteraemia, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), increased significantly from 33.6 to 47.3% (P < 0.001) while that of Gram-negative bacteraemia fell from 60.0 to 47.0% (P < 0.001). Among blood isolates, methicillin resistance of CNS increased from 17.0 to 58.0% (P < 0.001) and cefuroxime resistance of Enterobacter spp. increased from 21.0 to over 50% (P < 0.01). Among urinary isolates, cefuroxime resistance of Klebsiella spp. (11.0 to 24.0%, P < 0.001) and Enterobacter spp. (32.0 to 75.0%, P < 0.001) increased. Nalidixic acid resistance among Gram-negative urinary isolates, except Proteus mirabilis, rose by three- to sixfold. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated from the respiratory tract, penicillin resistance increased dramatically (2 to 18%, P < 0.001). For respiratory isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin resistance increased from 17.0 to 29.0% (P < 0.001). These data are useful in guiding empirical treatment of nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 71.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) was also active with the MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis VCM showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The others except ABPC were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae Most of the agents were active against S. agalactiae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Penicillins, cephems, erythromycin (EM), and clindamycin (CLDM) showed the highest activities. The MIC90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml or below. Amikacin (AMK) and minocycline (MINO) showed somewhat low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. Cefozopran (CZOP) and gentamicin (GM) were also active with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems generally were not so active. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM and GM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. CZOP and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Flomoxef (FMOX), CZOP, IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli.

TI  - Microflora associated with percutaneous craniofacial implants used for the retention of facial prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  - Craniofacial implants have been used successfully for the retention of facial prostheses. However, complications occur that can lead to the loss of implant integration. One such complication is infection possibly resulting from crevicular microflora activity. As part of an ongoing study, samples from crevicular sites surrounding 17 craniofacial implants were collected and submitted for microbiological assay. The results demonstrated the presence of opportunistic pathogens in many sites regardless of subjects' hygiene efforts. The significance of the findings is reviewed.

TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of L-695,256, a carbapenem active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - The activity of a new prototype carbapenem, L-695,256, against clinical isolates  of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes was studied in vitro by agar dilution. L-695,256 was highly active against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible isolates of staphylococci (MICs, 0.016 to 2 micrograms/ml) and against penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MICs, 0.016 to 0.064 micrograms/ml), irrespective of penicillin susceptibility. Activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was less than that of imipenem, while Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii were more susceptible to L-695,256.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  - Using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. The bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Rhodococcus equi (n = 4), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and Escherichia coli (n = 3). In addition, two isolates of Enterobacter spp. and one isolate of Streptococcus equisimilis, Staphylococcus intermedius, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens were examined. For determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were fixed as limiting values: Trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. As expected, Rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. However, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. According to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - [Multicenter evaluation of oral antibiotics: resistance behavior in 5 Swiss centers].
AB  - The susceptibility of 2196 fresh clinical isolates to twelve different oral compounds was assessed in five Swiss microbiology institutions during summer 1992. A standardized microdilution system including all other material necessary was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin. The aminopenicillins (including the beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) were highly active against the streptococci, in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor they covered the majority of the bla+ E. coli and Proteus mirabilis and between 60 to 80% of the Klebsiella spp. and Proteus vulgaris isolates. All the cephalosporins exhibited good activity against the streptococci, they were active against Gram-negative fermentative rods to a varying degree. Cefetamet was also active against many cefaclor and cefuroxime-resistant isolates. A considerable part of the species studied exhibited resistance to doxycycline; the observed resistance of S. agalactia, P. mirabilis, and Morganella morganii agreed with previous findings. Most of the Streptococcus spp. were inhibited by erythromycin and clindamycin. There were only single penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in the five Swiss centers. Taking account of the above particulars the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in Switzerland can be considered satisfactory.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - Bacteremia in a long term care facility.
AB  - Episodes of bacteremia identified in a long term care facility over a seven and a half-year period from July 1984 to December 1991 were reviewed. Twenty-nine episodes of bacteremia were identified, a rate of 4.35/100,000 patient-days. The most common infecting organisms were Escherichia coli (11 episodes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (four), Proteus mirabilis (three), Staphylococcus aureus (three) and Bacteroides species (two). The source of bacteremia was urinary in 45% of patients, gastrointestinal in 17%, pneumonia in 14%, skin in 14% and unknown in 10%. The overall case fatality rate was 24%, but for the final six years of the review the case fatality rate was only 9.5%. These observations report a rate of bacteremia 10-fold lower than reported from other North American long term care facilities and, potentially, a lower case fatality rate. The primary site of bacteremia, however, in long term care facilities is the urinary tract.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration and in-vitro activity of loracarbef, a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of loracarbef in plasma and a mild inflammatory exudate were studied in human volunteers. After a single oral dose of 400 mg, a mean maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of 17.8 mg/L was achieved in the plasma at 1.2 h (mean Tmax). The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) was 1.3 h. In the inflammatory exudate the mean Cmax was 8.9 mg/L at a mean Tmax of 2.0 h and with a mean T1/2 of 1.7 h. The mean penetration into the inflammatory exudate was 90.1%. The in-vitro activity of loracarbef was determined against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L respectively, regardless of beta-lactamase production), as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 of 2 mg/L). Loracarbef was also active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s of < or = 2 mg/L). The in-vitro activity and pharmacokinetics of loracarbef suggest that it would be efficative therapy for patients with community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by the most frequently-encountered bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - Bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984-1989).
AB  - Twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH), University of California, Davis, between 1984 and 1989. Characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13 foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. Laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dL), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microL), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microL). Thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. In 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. Microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (TBA) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. Microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. Tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. Cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or postmortem. Virologic examination of TBA, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. Viral culture of TBA from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type II (EHV-II). In addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. Pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. The predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. Many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. The peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. Type II cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  - In order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (CFTM), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from July 1990 to June 1991 and from July 1992 to February 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. The obtained results are summarized below. 1. No CFTM-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. It appeared that Streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were increasing. The former included benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) of PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "Extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. The MIC's of beta-lactams against the above PISP or PRSP, and against cephems-resistant E. coli tended to be high, but those of CFTM were relatively low (in most cases). 3. Proportions of strains resistant to cephems, including CFTM among Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri were high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. As mentioned above, CFTM is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. Except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of MIC90's, and as far as MIC80's are concerned, CFTM still is as active as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - The management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  - The standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. For those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. Despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. Over a six-year-period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. The initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. The surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. There were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. Blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. The blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. in two, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. From the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), Proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and Enterobacter sp. in two. Both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. Amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature, and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by MEDLINE; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. STUDY SELECTION: Only published comparative clinical trial reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. Noncomparative clinical data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the Food and Drug Administration are not included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. In clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. Cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. Cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Loracarbef. A review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  - Loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. At low concentrations (< 2 mg/L) in vitro, it inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups B, C and G. Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. At therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. When administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. Loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is administered twice daily. It offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. A total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. Of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. All were included in the safety analysis. Clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. Bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18 (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. One Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. Persisting organisms with amoxicillin included Haemophilus influenzae (four), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), Escherichia coli (two), Streptococcus pneumoniae (one), Neisseria species (one), and Proteus mirabilis (one). Adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. Insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. Fleroxacin may be indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due to Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis. The 92% incidence of resistance among the S. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  - Immunological characterization of various Pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using sera from infected humans and from patients with other bacterial infections. Somatic (SOM) and partially purified cell extracts (PCE) gave more complex SDS-PAGE patterns: M(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kDa, respectively. The culture-filtrated antigens (CF) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands M(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kDa. PCE and CF reacted specifically with infected human sera; SOM did not. The components with M(r) of 40 kDa in CF reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri. This peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in CF thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.
TI  - [Nose and throat carriage in "food handlers"].
AB  - From December 1991 to February 1992, 450 personnel have been investigated for pathogen microorganisms in their nose and throat. The study was performed in the Infectious Diseases Section of Gulhane Military Medical Academy. Pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from 54 nose culture (12%) and 6 throat culture (1.33%). In one person pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from his nose and throat. The difference between the two groups (The nose and throat cultures) was significant at p = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test (t = 6.414). In the nose cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (85.2%), Proteus vulgaris (5.6%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.8%), Citrobacter freundii (1.8%), Group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (1.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%). Only one (1.85%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris) in his nasal culture. In the throat cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (66.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (50%). Only one (16.6%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) in his throat culture. The same pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus) has been isolated in an only one person's nasal and throat cultures (0.22%). We treated 60 personnel who were nasal and throat carriers according to the results of antibiograms. After treatment, two still had previous pathogen microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus). These two carriers were eradicated by repeating the treatment.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefprozil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a fine granular form for pediatric use, was administered to children with bacterial infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) against the following 84 strains isolated from cases to which CFPZ was administered; 55 strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 49 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 29 strains of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including 10 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. MIC determination of these strains was done with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. In pharmacokinetic studies, serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were investigated using bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CFPZ was orally administered 30 minutes before meals to 9 children with ages ranging from 7 years and 1 month to 12 years and 3 months. Three groups of 3 children were tested with doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. In addition to the above, clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 160 cases consisting of children with ages ranging 5 months to 12 years and 5 months. A mean dose of 8.6 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses (130 cases of t.i.d. and 30 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 7 days. The 160 cases included 34 cases of pharyngitis, 5 cases of tonsillitis, 8 cases of acute bronchitis, 8 cases of pneumonia, 52 cases of scarlet fever, 4 cases of acute purulent otitis media, 47 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis and 1 case of posthitis. Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined in 166 cases, including 6 cases excluded from the evaluation of clinical efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. With regard to GPC, MICs of CFPZ against 2 strains of S. aureus were 0.78 or 1.56 micrograms/ml and CFPZ showed the second highest activity to MCIPC. MICs of CFPZ against 49 strains of S. pyogenes were all less than 0.025 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - Parameters characterizing the in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, against respiratory and urinary pathogens.
AB  - The wide and potent in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, has been confirmed on a collection of respiratory and urinary pathogens recently isolated in Italy. The new cephem emerged as the most bactericidal of all the comparators tested against several fast as well as slowly-growing gram-negative species including Enterobacteria, Haemophilus and Moraxella, irrespective of their ability to synthetize beta-lactamases. Among the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were effectively covered. Cefixime activity was not adversely influenced by several important variables such as pH (over the range from 5 to 8), inoculum size (from 10(5) to 10(8) CFU per ml) and the presence of 50% human serum or urine. Time-kill tests confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of the drug especially towards common respiratory pathogens (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes). Killing of urinary strains was optimal at cefixime concentrations reached in urine since eradication, except for Proteus mirabilis, was enhanced with increasing levels of the drug. The absence of an untoward paradoxic effect on the rate of cefixime bactericidal action was confirmed by employing a dynamic bladder model simulating the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single 200 mg daily dosage. Interactions of cefixime with several other drugs that may be employed in combination therapy were generally prone to provide indifference and synergism while antagonism was never observed. Favorable interactions were also registered when cefixime acted with other antibiotics on partially resistant species such as Staphylococci and Pseudomonas. The new cephem seems to provide excellent opportunities for expanding oral cephalosporin therapy to a wide range of infections produced by susceptible pathogens in the adult and pediatric populations.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin BK-218.
AB  - BK-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. BK-218 was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher MICs. BK-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. Moderate BK-218 activity was observed against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (MIC90, 1 mg/l), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 2 mg/l), and Proteus mirabilis (MIC90, 2 mg/l). The following organisms were generally BK-218-resistant (MIC90, greater than 16 mg/l): Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus, Serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - In most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (BM) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. The search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. In this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of BM was done in two hospitals in Mali and Niger, between March, 1989, and May, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48 h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). The cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). No outbreak occurred during the study period. The hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. Main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. The case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for Neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133) for Haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for Streptococcus pneumoniae. In a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference between treatment groups. Our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for BM in high-incidence countries.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten. Results of a multicenter study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftibuten (CBT) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (I) Naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: E. coli 0.12-0.5, Shigella 0.06-0.12 and Salmonella 0.03-0.12, P. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (II) Chromosomal penicillinase producing species: K. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and K. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (III) Chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii 1- greater than 128: S. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + Proteus 0.06-0.12. Activity of CBT was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, CBT was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. CBT was inactive on P. aeruginosa (MIC greater than or equal to 32) and on A. baumannii (8- greater than 128). Haemophilus and Gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to CBT (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for Meningococci; B. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin G) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin G). CBT was inactive on Staphylococci. Enterococci and Streptococci B were generally resistant; Streptococci A, C, G were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas MIC for other Streptococci 0.12 to 128 (MIC 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for Pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). These antibacterial properties particularly against Enterobacteriaceae placed CBT in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Severe infections treated with intravenous ofloxacin: a prospective clinical multicentre Swiss study.
AB  - In this open prospective clinical trial of iv ofloxacin, 87 patients were treated for severe bacterial infections. Overall results showed a clinical cure rate of 75% and 79/87 87 patients improved. 86% of causative organisms (all sensitive to ofloxacin) were eliminated. The best results were obtained in urinary tract infections where all 30 patients were clinically cured and 27 organisms (Escherichia coli, group D streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were eliminated. Rapid clinical cure was observed in five patients with prostatitis. Good results were seen in arthritis and osteomyelitis. Less than three days of parenteral therapy were required before improvement was seen in patients presenting with severe enterocolitis. Ofloxacin treatment was used for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 35 patients. Clinical improvement was noted in 28 patients. Five patients had unsatisfactory responses, mainly due to underlying diseases. There were two failures, both in pneumococcal pneumonia. Three minor side effects were recorded. Ofloxacin can be given for severe bacterial infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, other Gram-negative rods and other sensitive organisms. It can be given in penicillin allergic patients but it should not be used in pneumococcal pneumonia.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Open trial of cefepime (BMY 28142) for infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum, semisynthetic parenteral cephem antibiotic, were evaluated in an open trial at a single hospital. Seventy patients were treated with cefepime: 44 had lower respiratory tract infections, 4 had urinary tract infections, and 22 had skin or soft tissue infections. Of 65 clinically evaluable patients, 64 (98%) had satisfactory responses. No mortality or superinfections occurred. Of 57 respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, 54 (95%) were eradicated and 3 (5%) persisted after therapy. Five bacteremias (two with Streptococcus pneumoniae and one each with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and a coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were eradicated. MICs ranged from 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for 13 S. aureus and 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and were less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 10 streptococcal isolates. Adverse effects occurred in two patients: transient diarrhea and Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool in one patient and loose bowel movements and increased transaminases in the other patient. Cefepime appeared to be well tolerated in humans and was effective against a wide range of isolates, including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Hygienic status of food handlers.
AB  - The study demonstrated bacterial species on hands and nails of food-handlers before and after hand-washing. Those were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Diphtheroid, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Citrobacter freundii. Before hand washing, each food-handler harboured one to eight bacterial species. After hand-washing (eight with water from plastic boxes, 97 from pipe water, 57 out of 97 (58.8%) used soap or detergent with water), disappearance of one to four bacterial strains from hands and nails were found in 47.6 per cent of food-handlers. Cultures of water used for washing from eight plastic boxes yielded Staph. spp., Strep. spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Kleb.pneumoniae, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae. From pipe water, Diphtheroid in 4, 4.1 per cent Micrococcus in 1, 1.03 per cent were shown. Comparing bacterial species found in food-handlers with long nails and short nails, 4-8 more species were revealed in the former than the latter for 35.7 per cent. After hand-washing, there was recontamination of bacterial species in 17 food-handlers. This was probably due to dirty napkins or dresses during hand-drying or from water in plastic boxes.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  - Meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. All antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. Generalized infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. Immunocompromised mice infected with Ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. Those given a greater challenge of Ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. Treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of E. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. Infection with Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. Lung infections caused by Ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. These results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. In the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. The more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml) of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). Cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. Due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). As a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in primary care: predominant microbes and their antibiotic sensitivity].
AB  - We have prospectively evaluated 227 episodes of community-acquired urinary tract  infection (UTI) from October 1st to December, 15th, 1987. The urine samples, adequately collected, were processed in the Bacteriology Laboratory of the Albacete General Hospital. E. coli was the most commonly isolated organism (62%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (6.6%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.6%), Serratia marcescens (6.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.2%). As regards the sensitivity of E. coli to the most commonly used antibiotics, there was a 56% resistance to ampicillin, 37% to cotrimoxazole, 40% to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, and 46% to cephalothin. These are in contrast with the small number of resistance, at least in vitro, to urinary chemotherapeuticals and phosphomycin. We emphasize the importance of the knowledge of the organisms more commonly involved in UTI and their updated sensitivity to antimicrobials for the best management of these infections.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - A new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. BMY-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. BMY-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more active than cephalexin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to BMY-28100 and cefaclor. The bactericidal activity of BMY-28100 against S. aureus, E. coli and P. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as MIC value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. The stability of BMY-28100 against penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. BMY-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three Gram-positive bacterial infections. BMY-28100 was also more potent against infections of H. influenzae and P. mirabilis, but slightly less active against E. coli Juhl than cefaclor. Blood level parameters of BMY-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. The urinary recovery of BMY-28100 was somewhat higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees C.
TI  - The resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  - Isolates of Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with Escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. All species survived the antiseptic. Organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. The effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. Examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. We conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.
TI  - Post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies were conducted to evaluate cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new cephem type antibiotic, in the pediatric field. A total of 9 pediatric patients (2-14 years) was treated with intravenous injection of CZON: 4 cases with one shot of 20 mg/kg, 2 cases with one shot of 40 mg/kg and 3 cases with drip infusion over 1 hour of 40 mg/kg. CZON concentrations in serum and the excretion in urine were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 49.0, 22.7, 9.03, 2.13, 0.37, and 0.09 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. With 40 mg/kg one shot intravenous injections, mean serum concentrations were 117.5, 68.0, 26.2, 8.80, 0.63 and 0.19 micrograms/ml at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. With 40 mg/kg intravenous drip infusions over 1 hour, mean concentrations were 57.1, 78.8, 12.9, 1.12 and 0.23 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively. Mean half-lives were 0.69 hour for 20 mg/kg one shot injections, 0.44 hour for 40 mg/kg one shot injections, and 0.58 hour for 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusions. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hour after administration were 70.8% (mean) for the 20 mg/kg one shot injection, 44.1% (1 case) for the 40 mg/kg one shot injection, and 60.0% (mean) for the 40 mg/kg 1 hour drip infusion. CZON was administered in 26 cases of pediatric infections, and the clinical efficacy, antibacterial activity, and side effects were evaluated. Of the 26 cases 2 were excluded for the reason of not having bacterial infection, and the remaining 24 cases were assessed. Included in the 24 cases were 16 cases of acute pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent lymphadenitis, and 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent otitis media, acute apical periodontitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), acute pyelonephritis, and acute enteritis. Clinical efficacy evaluation showed 19 excellent cases and 5 good cases, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, beta-Streptococcus 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 10 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain, Proteus mirabilis 1 strain, and Campylobacter jejuni 1 strain were determined or assumed as pathogens, but all of them were eradicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis. Influence of antibiotic treatment on the bacterial spectrum.
AB  - The work was undertaken to investigate the spectrum of bacteria responsible for acute mastoiditis and to find out whether it is affected by intake of antibiotics prior to surgical treatment. The records were reviewed of 22 children with acute mastoiditis in whom mastoidectomy had been performed and bacterial cultures obtained. Eleven of the patients had had antibiotic treatment prior to admission (9 penicillin V and 2 erythromycin). Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in 8 of the purulent discharges: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus beta-hemolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus in 2 each; Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas pyocyaneus and a Bacteroides strain in 1 each, while five discharges-all from patients pretreated with antibiotics-yielded no growth. None of the 9 patients pretreated with penicillin V provided pure cultures of pneumococci or beta-hemolytic streptococci, while one or the other of these species was found in 8 of the 11 untreated patients. Gram-negative bacteria were found both among those with and those without antibiotic pretreatment. The data indicate that pneumococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci are more likely to cause mastoiditis than are the other pathogens found in acute otitis media, and that, when drained at operation, purulent discharges are often found to have been sterilized by the pre-operative antibiotic treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MICs for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for Streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. CI-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to CI-934. CI-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii. The medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of CI-934. Magnesium at a concentration of 9 mM increased MICs and MBCs four- to eightfold, and testing at pH 6 increased MICs as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with MICs at pH 7. The frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. SK&F 88070 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. It was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus. SK&F 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to SK&F 88070. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the Proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. SK&F 88070 inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in Hungary.
AB  - This survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by Public Health Network laboratories in 1983. Facultatively pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except Escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. Oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against Staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. In contrast to other streptococci, all Streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. The majority of the Gram-positive strains were resistant to tetracycline. A comparison to results reported earlier (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. Resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of Proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. Emergence of Haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of P. mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. The increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. In some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. A restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. Multiresistant Gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in Hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a representative clinical material. The frequent occurrence of multiresistant P. mirabilis and Acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. Surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant E. coli strains was very low. Amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - A 12-month fever surveillance study in a veterans' long-stay institution.
AB  - This report describes a 12-month fever surveillance survey in a 258-bed veterans  long-term care institution. There were 128 episodes of fever (one episode per 24 patient-months); 114 were studied. Lower respiratory tract infections were most frequent, 36 (32%), with 26 (23%) urinary tract infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in the chest infections and Proteus mirabilis the most common of the urinary tract infections. In 40 (35%) there was no evidence of a lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, or other bacterial infection. Most recovered rapidly, many with no specific treatment. There was a 16% mortality associated with the febrile episodes.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - [Distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. II].
AB  - In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as ABPC, SBPC, MPC, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX, CPZ, CFS and GM against major clinical isolates, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, was examined. In this paper, we will report the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. CEZ- and GM-resistant S. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. CMZ and CFS have showed potent activity against CEZ-resistant S. aureus. It seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant S. aureus. The penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of S. pyogenes could not be found in our study. Quite a few strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. Some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to CPZ, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to GM.
TI  - [Bronchial diffusion of piperacillin in 18 intensive care patients].
AB  - Eighteen patients (13 under mechanical ventilation) in an intensive care unit received piperacillin for pneumonia (7 cases) or bronchial infection (11 cases), related to Haemophilus influenzae (7), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4) or miscellaneous pathogens (7) including Staphylococcus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Each patient was given 2g piperacillin intravenously every six hours. Concentrations in serum and bronchial secretion samples were assayed by the agar diffusion technique using a susceptible strain of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Maximum concentrations were 157 micrograms/ml in serum and 3.60 micrograms/ml in bronchial secretions. These results are similar to those obtained with the same dosage by 0. Cars in serum (150 micrograms/ml) and by G.E. Marlin in the bronchial secretions (3.78 micrograms/ml). They approximate those published for other penicillins with the same dosage.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - The use of penicillins in orthopaedic surgery.
AB  - The main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group D streptococci (enterococci). Penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. The tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. Semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Canine urinary tract infections: a comparison of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results and response to oral therapy with ampicillin or with trimethoprim-sulfa.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of ampicillin therapy in all 56 urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and S intermedius), in all 26 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 38 of 44 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 29 of 31 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 8 of 10 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and in 16 of 20 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 173 of 187 (92.5%) isolates responded to ampicillin therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results. In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of therapy with trimethoprim-sulfa in 119 of 138 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 33 of 45 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, in 38 of 43 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 21 of 25 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 9 of 11 UTI caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci, and in 19 of 21 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 239 of 283 (84%) isolates responded to trimethoprim-sulfa therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - The effect of capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis on polymorph function and serum killing.
AB  - The determinant responsible for the ability of Bacteroides spp. to inhibit polymorph phagocytic killing of aerobic organisms has not yet been identified. Therefore, the roles of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide of B. fragilis were investigated. Serum-resistant and serum-sensitive strains of Proteus mirabilis were used to indicate inhibition of phagocytic killing and serum killing of aerobes. Whole organisms of B. fragilis, purified lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide were added to an in-vitro phagocytosis system. Results showed that greater than 10(7) bacteroides/ml inhibited both serum and phagocytic killing. Concentrations below 10(7)/ml had little effect on either process. Purified capsular polysaccharide (10 or 100 micrograms/ml), either alone in the system or in combination with sub-inhibitory concentrations of B. fragilis also markedly inhibited serum and phagocytic killing. Lipopolysaccharide (9 micrograms/ml) appeared relatively inert. B. ovatus, reputedly non-capsulated, produced identical results to those obtained with B. fragilis, but an encapsulated strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae did not inhibit serum or phagocytic killing.
TI  - Low levels of functional of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in the promotion of C3-cleavage by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyema.
AB  - It has been suggested that C3 breakdown by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyemas may be related to a decreased inhibitor potential for these enzymes. In the present study it was shown that in 17 infected pleural effusions, high proteolytic activity on 125I-labeled C3 (16.3% +/- 4.4%) correlated with low functional levels of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI), as determined by trypsin-inhibitory capacity (56.2 +/- 20.1 IU/ml; rs = -0.97, P less than .001), whereas in 18 sterile pleural effusions there was no such correlation (125I-labeled C3 cleavage, 2.2% +/- .2%; trypsin-inhibitory capacity, 192.6 +/- 26.7 IU/ml). However, alpha 1-PI and alpha 2-macroglobulin protein concentrations in infected and sterile effusions (as measured by immunodiffusion) were similar. Fifteen strains of three bacterial species--Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis--isolated from patients with pneumonia or empyema inactivated the elastase-inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-PI in vitro. These results show that in empyemas functional levels of alpha 1-PI were too low to inactivate granulocyte elastase and that some bacterial species may contribute to the low inhibitor potential of infected pleural fluid by direct alpha 1-PI inactivation.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Volatile products from acetylcholine as markers in the rapid urine test using head-space gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Head-space gas--liquid chromatographic analyses of cultures of all Proteus spp. showed that the production of trimethylamine from acetylcholine could be the marker for the detection in 3.5 h of significant numbers of P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans A in the rapid test for Escherichia and Klebsiella spp. in urine specimens. Trimethylamine was not detected in cultures of five other urinary pathogens. Six of fifteen strains of K. aerogenes produced trimethylamine from acetylcholine but were distinguished from Proteus spp. by ethanol production from arabinose. Ethyl acetate was produced from acetylcholine by P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, P. inconstans A, P. inconstans B, E. coli, K. aerogenes and Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of canine urinary bacteria to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary tract infections. Antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Escherichia coli; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, Str faecium, and Str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of Str canis. No antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin was closest, at 89%.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Bacteremia in a Veterans Administration Medical Center (1961-1981).
AB  - Laboratory data on blood cultures were reviewed for the period 1961-1981. Blood cultures accounted for 18% of all bacterial cultures. Nine percent of all blood cultures were positive for growth, including pathogens and contaminants. Of these, 21% wer contaiminants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common contaminant while Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently occurring pathogens, respectively. Four percent of all positive blood cultures, involving pathogens, had multiple organisms with E. coli the most common. There was no drastic change in the frequency of occurrence of Gram negative or positive isolates over the years, but certain pathogens like Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp. and Group A Streptococci were more common from 1971-81 than 1961-70. One percent of all patients with positive blood cultures had the same organism for two months or longer. Analysis of these longer occurring infections yielded a mean of 15, median of 7 and range of 2-87 months. E. coli was the most common pathogen in these chronic infections, followed by S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  - During a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. The annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. Gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (24 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and Proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). Candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. The burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of Enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). The plastic surgery service had more Serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more Escherichia coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. More than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. Hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. Estimates were made of the economic benefits of successful control programs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  - Sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Actinobacillus equuli, and Corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. When diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. pH values were recorded for each filtrate. Specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. All specimens were maintained at 25 degrees C in a water bath. Ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. The major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. From this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. The differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at P less than 0.01.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in complicated urinary infections failing to respond to conventional therapy.
AB  - Forty-three patients with a history of recurrent urinary infections, many of whom had renal involvement and had recently failed treatment, were then treated with pivmecillinam (400 mg 8-hourly for seven days). One week after the end of treatment the bacteriological cure rate was 72.1%. During the following four weeks, however, several of the cured patients relapsed, so that the cure rate five weeks after the end of treatment was only 46%. Thus, it is recommended that such patients should begin prophylactic treatment if found to be abacteriuric after the one week follow-up. Pivmecillinam was extremely well tolerated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  - Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. Cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although cefotiam was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  - Persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. The persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. Although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. With gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. With gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The duration of the postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration of exposure up to a point of maximal response. Persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.
TI  - Relation of antibody-coated urine bacteria to the site(s) of infection in experimental dogs.
AB  - Antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (Ig)G and anti-IgA, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. Urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with Staphylococcus aureus were tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with Escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with Proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with Klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with P rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, or Streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. Specimens of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. The results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. False-positive results (ie, evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%) tests of dogs infected with S aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with P mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with E coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with K pneumoniae. False-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with E coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with P mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with S aureus. It was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and clinical experiences of the combination sulfadiazine-trimethoprim in the short-term treatment of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of sulfadiazine (SD) combined in a small dose (250 mg) with  trimethoprim (TMP, 160 mg) and given twice daily were studied in eight healthy subjects. Both drugs were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and their concentrations in serum as well as in urine could be considered high enough for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (UTI). In none of the subjects did the concentration of SD in urine exceed the experimental limit established for crystallization of the drug. Serum half-lives of SD and TMP were 10.8 and 11.8 hrs, respectively. In microbiological assay synergistic interaction was found in human urine with both the combination of SD + TMP and SM (sulfamethoxazole) + TMP on all the tested strains of E. coli, Str. faecalis, Str. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. A double-blind clinical trial was carried out with patients having acute UTI, using either the combination SD + TMP (250 mg + 160 mg) or the combination SM + TMP (800 mg + 160 mg) twice daily for one week. The results of the treatment were equally successful in both groups. Treatment failed in only 4 out of 85 cases, although in 12 cases the causative micro-organism was resistant in vitro to the combination of SM + TMP.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of co-trimoxazole and tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the newly developed combination, tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine, was evaluated and compared with that of the combination, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Tested strains were: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus faecalis. The components in both combinations were assayed in different ratios on a weight basis and activities measured as minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations employing serial dilution tests in Isosensitest bouillon in microtiter plates. It was found that the combination tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine acts synergistically -- as does the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole -- optimal antibacterial activities being achieved with a weight ratio benzylpyrimidine/sulfonamide of 1:1 or 1:5, respectively. In all instances, the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole proved to be of higher antibacterial in vitro activity than that of tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine.
TI  - Clinical experience with cefamandole in pneumonia.
AB  - The efficacy and patient acceptance of i.m. cefamandole 1 000 mg 8 h and 500 mg 8 h, were compared in the treatment of assumed community-acquired pneumonia in 59 hospitalized adult patients. Of 31 patients treated with 1 000 mg 8 h, 94% had a satisfactory clinical response with a 13% bacteriological failure rate. Of 28 patients treated with 500 mg 8 h, 89% had a satisfactory clinical response with a 60% bacteriological failure rate. The only side effect registered was pain at the injection site after doses of more than 1 000 mg. The pain could be eliminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of lidocaine to the drug solution before injection.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity of bacteria isolated from clinical samples (author's transl)].
AB  
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as growth medium. The results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. The concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. Moxalactam was highly inhibitory against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. Moxalactam was highly superior against Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the MIC100 and MIC90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. High sensitivity was found in strains of Salmonella species, nine of which were Salmonella typhi: the MIC90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. The broad-spectrum activity and unusual MIC patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on three hydroxyiminophenylacetyl cephalosporins with particular reference to SK&F 80303, an unusually long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - Three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (SK&F 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and various Gram-negative bacilli. All three were active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against S. aureus, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. SK&F 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. It was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from S. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from E. coli strains. SK&F 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (partially). SK&F 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. Its combined biological properties make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Trimethoprim in combination with a sulfonamide for oral treatment of canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - Trimethoprim, in combination with sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole was administered orally for 7 to 14 days to 84 dogs with urinary tract infections (UTI). The daily dosage of 26.4 mg/kg (12 mg/lb) was divided into 2 equal parts and administered at about 12-hour intervals. Response to treatment, based on negative urine culture during or after therapy, was 37 of 45 (82%) for UTI caused by Escherichia coli, 11 of 15 (73%) UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, 8 of 12 (67%) UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 of 6 (100%) UTI caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 of 9 (56%) UTI caused by Streptococcus spp. These 5 species comprised 88% of the bacteria isolated from the dogs in this study.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - BL-S786 (ceforanide), a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - BL-S786 (ceforanide) is a new cephalosporin which showed broad-spectrum activity  in vitro against 453 clinical isolates. At a concentration of 3.12 mug/ml, it inhibited greater than 75% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essentially no activity was observed against isolates of Serratia marcescens, and only minimal activity was observed against Enterobacter spp. Its activity was directly related to the size of the inoculum. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar to the minimal inhibitory concentrations for isolates of all organisms except S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for these organisms.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefaclor (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study was conducted on the in vitro activity of cefaclor and other  oral cephalosporins against a large number of freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The activity of cefaclor against gram-positive pathogens is very similar to that of cephalexin. The action of cefaclor against Streptococcus pneumoniae is superior. Cefaclor is the most active antibiotic against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and is also more active than cephalexin and cephradine against non-beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Significance of microbial contamination of stored cadaver kidneys.
AB  - The importance of microbial contamination of cadaver kidneys was assessed in 83 consecutively stored and transplanted kidneys. Fourteen kidneys had a single positive culture during storage and five had multiple positive cultures. Only one postoperative infection could be traced to kidney contamination during storage (Candida wound infection). In three of 64 patients who received noncontaminated kidneys, posttransplant wound infections developed. No wound infections occurred in 35 patients who received prophylactic antibiotics, whereas four wound infections occurred in 48 patients without antibiotic coverage. It is concluded that, although microbial contamination of stored cadaver kidneys occurs commonly, it is not an important source of infection in renal transplant recipients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - An overview of results of world-wide clinical trials with cefadroxil.
AB  - Cefadroxil, a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, is absorbed similarly by fasted and non-fasted subjects, produces sustained serum levels and is eliminated at a relatively slow rate. These pharmacokinetic properties permit less frequent and more convenient dosage scheduling than cephalexin and cephradine and consequently greater patient compliance. Cefadroxil was evaluated for safety in 1051 patients and for efficacy in 1030 patients. Overall it achieved a 91.8% rate of clinical success resulting from 881 complete cures and sixty-five clinical cures. Among 363 patients with respiratory tract infections and 471 patients with genito-urinary tract infections, cefadroxil treatment produced 97.5% and 84.5% clinical success, respectively. In the remaining infectious diseases treated, cefadroxil therapy resulted in 99.0% clinical success. Cefadroxil eradicated 87% of 1110 pathogens isolated, among which the most predominant pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Drug-related side-effects were reported in 7.2% of the patients.
TI  - Chemotactic activity of L-forms and mycoplasma.
AB  - L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis showed  significantly less chemotactic activity for normal human leucocytes than did parent bacterial forms which were strongly chemotactic. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma hominis did not demonstrate chemotactic activity.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  - Inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the WHO-ICS agar dilution technique. Cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, Haemophilus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. Cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. None of these cephalosporins was active against Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteeae, Pseudomonas, or Bacteroides fragilis.

TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. With P. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. Passive immunity against P. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized P. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. With S. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. These data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. The results further demonstrate that with P. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.
TI  - Bactericidal mechanisms in rabbit alveolar macrophages: evidence against peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The role of peroxidase-mediated bacterial killing by rabbit alveolar macrophages  was examined. During 3 h of incubation in vitro, alveolar macrophages ingested and killed greater than 88% of the Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae present in the incubation mixture. Preincubation of alveolar macrophages with inhibitors of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or sodium nitrite, did not alter their bactericidal potential. Iodination of ingested zymosan particles, a peroxidase-dependent and hydrogen peroxide-dependent reaction, was not observed, in spite of vigorous phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, iodination by alveolar macrophages was not significantly increased when peroxidase-coated zymosan particles were ingested. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide may not be available to the phagocytic vacuole for microbial killing. Since tetrazolium dye reduction reflects the activity of an oxidase responsible for stimulated oxygen consumption by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, this reaction was also measured. Rabbit alveolar macrophages incubated with latex particles did not exhibit an increased dye reduction compared with resting cells. The absence of significant stimulation of tetrazolium dye reduction indicates that the oxidase reaction does not occur in the proximity of the phagocytic vacuole of alveolar macrophages.
TI  - Polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  - Current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. The validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). During 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. In these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4 months before the episode of bacteremia. Only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. Monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). The mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. Prospectively, nine other patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). This study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.
TI  - In vitro studies of cefamandole.
AB  - Cefamandole is a new cephalosporin antibiotic that was tested in vitro against 540 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. A concentration of 0.39 mug/ml inhibited 95% of the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. A concentration of 6.25 mug/ml inhibited over 90% of the isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, 69% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 31% of the isolates of indole-positive Proteus spp. and Enterobacter spp. It was active against most cephalothin-resistant isolates of E. coli but not of K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin C, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin C and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. All of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited over 60% of isolates of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. There was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. Cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. There was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and pharmacology of flucloxacillin.
AB  - Flucloxacillin, a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins, was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers. The bactericidal activity of the drug against most strains of gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin. Each of the three penicillins was administered orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of 500 mg four times a day. The mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the serum were two- to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first, fourth and eighth days of therapy. The percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was 94.6 per cent; for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were 93.5 and 91.5 per cent, respectively. Using these data, the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin. These findings suggest that, when administered orally, this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of human peritoneal fluid.
AB  - Cell free peritoneal fluids from 23 normal women had antimicrobial activity which was directed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against yeasts. The activity was bacteriostatic or bactericidal and seemed to be due to the presence of a variety of factors which varied in their heat stability and dependence on complement. Lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not responsible for all the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Bacterial studies of Clindamycin-associated colitis. A preliminary report.
AB  - The cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. To test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. We were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. Those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. Those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. A third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. Thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the anaerobic microflora of the colon. The symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. Resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from patients at National Taiwan University Hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. Cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria except Enterococci. Staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. More than 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. The relative potency of cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. The gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. Among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative pathogens tested. The relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against E. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. One hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. The sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. Very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.
TI  - In vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
TI  - [Synthetic medium for testing of susceptibility. II. Susceptibility of bacteria to sulphonamides (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study of 9 media for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to 7 sulphonamides has been carried out. The evaluated culture-media included 4 "Mueller Hinton" media (MH), 4 others based on the formula of the "Diagnostic Sensitivity Test" agar base (D.S.T.) and a "Synthetic Medium" (SM) which has been developed in our laboratory. MH and D.S.T. culture-media have been supplied by 4 manufacturing companies in Europe and USA. A total number of 21 bacterial cultures have been employed. The included species belong to the gram negative genera Citrobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia and Shigella, and to the gram positive genus Streptococcus. Sulphafurazole, sulphasomidine, sulphamethoxazole, sulphamethoxypyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, sulphaphenazole and sulphamethoxydiazine have been investigated. SM proved to be clearly superior to the other 8 culture-media mentioned above. Just one MH afforded good results. The 3 other MH and 2 D.S.T. media were not quite satisfactory. The two remaining D.S.T. media were unsuitable. Moreover, the activity of the tested sulphonamides was not equally high against the concerned bacteria. The author discussed the significance of the inoculum-size and of competitive and noncompetitive sulphonamide-antagonists in commercial culture-media and the difficulties they raise by the interpretation of the results.

TI  - Treatment of pneumonia and other serious bacterial infections with cephapirin.
AB  - Nineteen patients with pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus  aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli were treated with 4 to 18 g of cephapirin daily. There were three treatment failures. One patient each with pneumonia due to E. coli or S. pneumoniae died despite apparent eradication of the pathogen. Lobar pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae progressed during therapy in a third patient to lung gangrene, necessitating pneumonectomy. Five additional patients with pneumococcal pericarditis or septic bursitis, empyema, cannula-associated bacteremia, and thoractomy wound infection due to S. aureus were cured. All isolates of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and group A Streptococcus were inhibited by 0.8 mug of cephapirin per ml; minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin were similar. Ninety percent of K. pneumoniae, 85% of Proteus mirabilis, 73% of E. coli, and 30% of Enterobacter were inhibited by 12.5 mug cephapirin per ml. All isolates of Pseudomonas, Serratia and indole-positive Proteus had a cephapirin minimal inhibitory concentration of [Formula: see text] 100 mug/mg. Serum concentrations after intravenous and intramuscular injection were similar to those reported for cephalothin. The intramuscular injections were moderately painful, and intravenous infusions caused phlebitis in three of nine patients treated with doses up to 18 g per day. Cephapirin appears comparable to cephalothin in vitro and is an effective agent in treatment of infection due to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - New antimicrobial nitrofuran, trans-5-amino-3-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-delta2-1,2,4-oxadiazole: antimicrobial efficacy in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.
AB  - A new antimicrobial nitrofuran designated SQ 18,506 showed some therapeutic activity when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella flexneri, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Animals infected parenterally with Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Candida albicans, or topically with Trichophyton mentagrophytes, did not respond to therapy with the drug at the dosage levels used. The compound was as effective as metronidazole in the topical treatment of experimental trichomonal infections in mice and in guinea pigs and as effective as nystatin, candicidin, or a sulfanilamide-aminacrine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of a candidal vaginal infection in rats. The chemotherapeutic efficacy of SQ 18,506 in experimental vaginitis caused by Escherichia coli in the rat surpassed that shown by four commercial products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.
TI  - Pulmonary infection due to disruption of the pharyngeal bacterial flora by antibiotics in hamsters.
AB  - An animal model was used to determine the effect of oxacillin on the pharyngeal bacterial flora and the relationship of this flora to pneumonia. The pharyngeal bacterial flora of 68 healthy Golden Syrian hamsters was determined. A quantitative comparison between Streptococci and Escherichia, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter from 70 hamsters was made before and at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after oxacillin administration. Lung cultures were positive in 22 of 25 hamsters, yielding K pneumoniae type 1 most frequently. Lung histology from 25 hamsters revealed bronchopneumonia. Intestinal postmortem cultures of treated and untreated animals were similar. The importance of throat cultures in diagnosing pneumonia and the value of the hamster model to study the effect of other antibiotics on the temporary flora are demonstrated.

AB  - IgG with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to IgG antibacterial antibody preparations. Opsonic human IgG obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. Antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. In vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. Under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of I(-) and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. Potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and E. coli. However, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of P. aeruginosa. Bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated IgG preparations. Antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. These in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

TI  - Clinical and in vitro evaluation of cefazolin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. Cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Proteus mirabilis. Cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against Escherichia coli and slightly more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive Proteus species. After a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, group A streptococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of Proteus species other than P. mirabilis. All of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. There were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. Cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. Its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.
TI  - Activity of methacycline, related tetracyclines, and other antibiotics against various L-forms and their parent bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The activity of methacycline against microbial L-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. The L-forms and bacteria used were Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (three strains), Proteus mirabilis (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (two strains), Sarcina flava, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of S. flava was more susceptible than the L-form. In general, other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms. There were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more susceptible than the L-form. These included the effect of polymyxin B and colistin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and P. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. flava, and S. marcescens.

TI  - Butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

A comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that BL-S 217 is about eightfold more effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BL-S 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., BL-S 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against Salmonella and Enterobacter. Overall, of 208 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to BL-S 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. BL-S 217 was less bound to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. The LD(50) of BL-S 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. When administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in S. pyogenes and D. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an E. coli infection. Its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.
TI  - In vitro activity of coumermycin A1.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. Coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against Staphylococcus aureus. It was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. Coumermycin also showed good activity against group A streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against Escherichia coli, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against Klebsiella-Enterobacter and enterococci. Against P. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. The new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. Coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. Also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin C antibiotic.
AB  - Concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. The in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. All strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all S. aureus, 80% of Escherichia coli, 72% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and 56% of Proteus mirabilis strains. About 90 to 96% of E. coli, Klebsiella Aerobacter, and P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. A peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. A mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. Food did not interfere with absorption. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. The mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group A streptococci, D. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, 85% of E. coli, and about 40 to 75% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter and P. mirabilis strains. Levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of E. coli, and P. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  - Serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. The in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. All strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Eighty per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Klebsiella-Aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. When single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. A full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. The peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group A streptococci and D. pneumoniae. Many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis. Urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the E. coli and P. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of Klebsiella-Aerobacter.
TI  - Bacterial interference induced in embryonated eggs by staphylococci.
AB  - Studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. All strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. The interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (A(2)J 305). Prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.Interference required infection with viable bacteria. The onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. The protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. Studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. Other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. Similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated virulence of the challenge organisms. All interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.
TI  - A NEW SELECTIVE BLOOD AGAR MEDIUM FOR STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES AND OTHER HAEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.
TI  - IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CEPHALOTHIN.
AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
