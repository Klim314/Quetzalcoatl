TI  - Telavancin activity tested against Gram-positive clinical isolates from European, Russian and Israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against Gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in European and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. METHODS: 11 601 consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. Interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the FDA and EUCAST, as available. RESULTS: Telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. All Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for VanA-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin MIC, >1 mg/l). Telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MIC values were obtained for VanA strains. Telavancin (both MIC50 and MIC90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the FDA/EUCAST-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. VanA-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. These results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from Europe.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug-resistant Enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. Despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant Enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. The present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted among hospitalized patients at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, from January to July 2013. Fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. Stool samples were inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (Bile Esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. The isolates were identified to genus and species level by cultural characteristics, Gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% NaCl broth, growth at 45 degrees C, motility test and by using API 20 Streptococcus system. Sensitivity testing was done using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using E-test strips. RESULT: Overall, Enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. The isolates were Enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), Enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and Enterococcus durans (8.8%). Among 114 tested Enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. Other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by Enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). Multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of E. faecium and E. faecalis. Vancomycin resistant Enterococci were observed in 5% of E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: This study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant Enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. Thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.
TI  - Collagen-like peptide sequences inhibit bacterial invasion of root dentine.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of peptides derived from the sequence of collagen to inhibit penetration of human or bovine dentine by species of streptococci and enterococci. METHODOLOGY: Blocks of human or bovine root dentine were infected for 14 d with bacterial cultures, in the presence or absence of various collagen-like peptide sequences. Invasion of dentinal tubules was determined from microscopic images of histochemically stained dentine thin sections. Extent of invasion was expressed as Tubule Invasion Index (TI), or Tubule Invasion Factor (TIF) which, in addition to the density of invasion, took into account the depth of invasion. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis were associated with heavy invasion (TI > 2.5, TIF > 4) of human or bovine root dentinal tubules, with E. faecalis being the most penetrative. Incorporation of peptides Gly-Pro-Ala or Gly-Pro-Hyp into the in vitro model system significantly reduced (P < 0.05) dentine invasion by the three species of highly-invasive organisms. Inhibition of bacterial invasion by the peptides was dose dependent, and the peptides did not inhibit bacterial growth in culture. CONCLUSION: Specific collagen-like peptide sequences inhibited the invasion of dentine in vitro by a range of oral bacteria. The peptides likely act as competitive inhibitors blocking bacterial collagen receptors and could potentially allow for target-specific control of dentine infections.

TI  - The cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  - AIM: To examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. METHODOLOGY: A total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. Samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. Microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (ATB system). The antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. RESULTS: A total number of 54 species were isolated. The most common was E. faecalis followed by Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus spp. Five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. However, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. Radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by Actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococci and Streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. The resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication.

TI  - Antimicrobial effect of zataria multiflora extract in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash on experimentally contaminated orthodontic elastomeric ligatures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Long-term use of orthodontic appliances and fixation ligatures creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of oral normal microflora and increases the risk of enamel demineralization and periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of Zataria Multiflora extract and 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash on experimentally contaminated orthodontic elastomeric ligatures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this lab trial study, Iranian and foreign-made elastomeric ligatures were experimentally contaminated in Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans suspensions. Ligatures were then decontaminated using 0.2% CHX as the control, 0.5 mg/ml Zataria multiflora extract mouthwashes as the test and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as the negative control for one hour. Antimicrobial properties of both solutions were evaluated by comparing the mean viable bacterial cell count on both rings after decontamination, using SPSS version 15 software. RESULTS: The mean viable bacterial cell count on Iranian ligatures was greater than that on foreign-made ligatures before disinfection (P=0.001), however this difference for C. albicans was not statistically significant (P=0.061). Chlorhexidine mouthwash completely eliminated all tested microorganisms attached to both elastomeric rings, but Zataria extract was only capable of completely eliminating C. albicans from both ligatures. Statistically significant differences were found in viable bacterial counts on both ligatures before and after disinfection with Zataria extract (P=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Zataria multiflora extract has antimicrobial properties and can be used for disinfection of elastomeric ligatures. In vivo studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the incorporation of this herbal extract in mouthwashes for orthodontic patients.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400, and polyethylene glycol 1000 against selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), and polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG 1000) against selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five vehicles, namely propylene glycol, glycerine, PEG 400, PEG 1000, and combination of propylene glycol with PEG 400, were tested for their bactericidal activity. The minimum bactericidal concentration was noted against four standard strains of organisms, i.e. Streptococcus mutans American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25175, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 12598, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 35550, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, using broth dilution assay. Successful endodontic therapy depends upon thorough disinfection of root canals. In some refractory cases, routine endodontic therapy is not sufficient, so intracanal medicaments are used for proper disinfection of canals. Intracanal medicaments are dispensed with vehicles which aid in increased diffusion through the dentinal tubules and improve their efficacy. Among the various vehicles used, glycerine is easily available, whereas others like propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol have to be procured from appropriate sources. Also, these vehicles, being viscous, aid in sustained release of the medicaments and improve their handling properties. The most commonly used intracanal medicaments like calcium hydroxide are ineffective on many microorganisms, while most of the other medicaments like MTAD (Mixture of Tetracycline, an Acid, and a Detergent) and Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP) consist of antibiotics which can lead to development of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms. Thus, in order to use safer and equally effective intracanal medicaments, newer alternatives like chlorhexidine gluconate, ozonized water, etc., are being explored. Similarly, the five vehicles mentioned above are being tested for their antimicrobial activity in this study. RESULTS: All vehicles exhibited bactericidal activity at 100% concentration. CONCLUSION: Propylene glycol was effective against three organisms namely S. mutans E. faecalis and E. coli and its bactericidal activity was at 50%, 25% and 50% respectively. PEG 1000 was effective against S. mutans and E. coli at 25%. Hence propylene glycol was effective on more number of organisms of which E. faecalis is a known resistant species. PEG 1000 was bactericidal at a lower concentration but was effective on two organisms only.
TI  - A derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A highly selective against Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A chemical derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A, designated NAI003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, NAI003 retained low MICs against all tested isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, NAI003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive P. acnes isolate. Gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, NAI003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (EF) Tu derived from Escherichia coli, E. faecalis or P. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, EF-Tu's derived from the NAI003-insenstitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that NAI003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the P. acnes EF-Tu. P. acnes mutants resistant to NAI003 were isolated by direct plating. With one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding EF-Tu. Because of its selective effect on P. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, NAI003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
TI  - Decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and Candida spp.
AB  - Tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by Bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. The polypeptide and its components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. Though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state of resistance are lacking. In the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. Using a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC and MIC90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus of the variety MSSA (susceptible to methicillin), Staphylococcus aureus of the variety MRSA (methicillin resistant), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spec., Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis was determined. All of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with MICs </= 4mg/l. The tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with MICs of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. No acquired resistance of the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. Thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of Staphylococcus aureus, both with MSSA and MRSA strains. The broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of cationic norbornanes as peptidomimetic antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A series of structurally amphiphilic biscationic norbornanes have been synthesised as rigidified, low molecular weight peptidomimetics of cationic antimicrobial peptides. A variety of charged hydrophilic functionalities were attached to the norbornane scaffold including aminium, guanidinium, imidazolium and pyridinium moieties. Additionally, a range of hydrophobic groups of differing sizes were incorporated through an acetal linkage. The compounds were evaluated for antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Activity was observed across the series; the most potent of which exhibited an MIC's </= 1 mug mL(-1) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and several strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant methicillin resistant (mMRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate (GISA) and vancomycin-intermediate (VISA) S. aureus.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004-2013.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. This report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The Cochran Armitage Trend Test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: Among the Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). Against Acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). The MIC90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/L. 40% (6,743/16,778) of A. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. Enterococci were highly susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2% of Enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of Enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. Against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. Globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in TEST during 2004-2013.
TI  - Total and Specific Bacterial Levels in the Apical Root Canal System of Teeth with Post-treatment Apical Periodontitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most studies of the microbiota in root canal-treated teeth focused  only on the main canal, not distinguishing regions nor incorporating the intricate anatomy in the analysis. Moreover, most of them provided only prevalence data. This study was designed to evaluate the total bacterial counts and the presence, levels, and relative abundance of candidate endodontic pathogens exclusively in the apical root canal system associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis. METHODS: Apical root specimens obtained during periradicular surgery of 27 adequately treated teeth with persistent apical periodontitis were cryogenically ground. DNA was extracted from the powder, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the total bacteria and 7 bacterial taxa. RESULTS: Samples from 21 teeth were positive for bacteria. Streptococcus species were the most prevalent (76%) followed by members of the Actinobacteria phylum (52%) and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (19%). The mean total bacterial load in the apical root segments was 5.7 x 104 cell equivalents per root apex (or 2.1 x 104/100 mg root powder). Streptococci comprised from 0.02%-99.9% of the total bacterial counts, Actinobacteria from 0.02%-84.7%, and P. alactolyticus from 67.9%-99%. Although Enterococcus faecalis was found in only 3 (14%) cases, it was dominant in 2. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus species, members of the Actinobacteria phylum, and P. alactolyticus were the most prevalent taxa in the apical canal system and dominated the bacterial populations in many cases of post-treatment apical periodontitis.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase A(2) of honey bee  (Apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  - In this work, we used the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by Apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. Apitoxin was assayed in natura and in the commercially available form. The antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase A2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. The following bacteria were tested: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus casei, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / mL, which indicated good antibacterial activity. Melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising MIC values, from 4 to 40 microg / mL. Phospholipase A2 presented MIC values higher than 400 microg / mL. Association of mellitin with phospholipase A2 yielded MIC values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / mL. Considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.
TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Plectasin NZ2114 in Combination with Cell Wall Targeting Antibiotics Against VanA-Type Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptide plectasin targeting bacterial cell wall precursor Lipid II  has been reported to be active against benzylpenicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae but less potent against vancomycin-resistant enterococci than their susceptible counterparts. The aim of this work was to test plectasin NZ2114 in combination with cell wall targeting antibiotics on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The activity of antibiotic combinations was evaluated against VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis strain BM4110/pIP816-1 by disk agar-induction, double-disk assay, determination of fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index, and time-kill curve. The results indicated that plectasin NZ2114 was synergistic in combination with teicoplanin, moenomycin, and dalbavancin but not with vancomycin, telavancin, penicillin G, bacitracin, ramoplanin, daptomycin, and fosfomycin. To gain an insight into the synergism, we tested other cell wall antibiotic combinations. Interestingly, synergy was observed between teicoplanin or moenomycin and the majority of the antibiotics tested; however, vancomycin was only synergistic with penicillin G. Other cell wall active antibiotics such as ramoplanin, bacitracin, and fosfomycin did not synergize. It appeared that most of the synergies observed involved inhibition of the transglycosylation step in peptidoglycan synthesis. These results suggest that teicoplanin, dalbavancin, vancomycin, and telavancin, although they all bind to the C-terminal D-Ala-D-Ala of Lipid II, might act on different stages of cell wall synthesis.
TI  - Could beta-hemolytic, group B Enterococcus faecalis be mistaken for Streptococcus agalactiae?
AB  - A beta-hemolytic Enterococcus faecalis strain agglutinating Lancefield group A, B, C, D, F, and G antisera was observed from a rectovaginal swab, in the context of antenatal screening for Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]). This is the first multi-Lancefield antisera-agglutinating isolate of this species, and it raised particular concern, as it may mimic GBS, leading to false reporting and useless receipt of intrapartum antibiotics.
TI  - Quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  - Various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qPCR in a single cohort. We quantify these bacteria (Fusobacterium spp., Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and afaC- or pks-positive E. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. We further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and MSI-status. With the exception of S. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. ETBF (FDR = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afaC-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. ETBF (FDR = 0.04 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and Fusobacterium spp. (FDR = 0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (III/IV) colorectal cancers. Fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. Fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). We also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by Fusobacterium and MSI-H (FDR = 0.05), age (FDR = 0.03) or pks-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.01). Furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical EPEC in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. By quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of Fusobacterium and ETBF.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - The effect of Indomethacin and Betamethasone on the cytokine response of human neonatal mononuclear cells to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Intrauterine infections with gram-positive bacteria pose a serious threat to neonates since they can result in neonatal sepsis, induce a fetal inflammatory response and also cause preterm birth. Despite intensive care, prematurity remains a leading cause of neonatal death, and is often accompanied by a number of morbidities. In order to prevent premature birth, tocolytic agents like Indomethacin are administered. Betamethasone is used to promote lung maturation and prevent respiratory distress syndrome. A combination of both drugs is assumed to prevent premature delivery while simultaneously facilitating lung maturation. This study investigates the effect of Betamethasone, Indomethacin and a combination of both on the cytokine production of neonatal cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) after stimulation with lysates of the gram-positive pathogens Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The aim of the study is to determine the impact of these drugs on the function of the neonatal immune system which should aid clinicians in choosing the optimal therapy in case of preterm birth associated with intrauterine infection. Betamethasone reduced the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12p40, MIP-1alpha and TNF and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, depending on the pathogen used for stimulation. In contrast to Betamethasone, Indomethacin almost exclusively increased IL-10 production. The combination of both drugs decreased the expression of IL-6, IL-12p40, MIP-1alpha and TNF while increasing IL-10 production, depending on the concentration of Indomethacin and the pathogen used for stimulation. Based on our results, the combination therapy with Indomethacin and Betamethasone has a similar effect on cytokine production as Betamethasone alone, which is generally administered in case of impending preterm birth. However, the combination therapy has the advantage of promoting lung maturation while simultaneously blocking preterm labor effectively.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Anacardium occidentale and Mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral health is an integral and important component of general health. Infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. The present day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. The uses of herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Anacardium occidentale (cashew) and Mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in India since time immemorial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), and suppression of biofilm. The cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cell lines. RESULTS: Cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (P < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. Although the MIC and MBC/MFC values of mouth rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. The leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (P < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. CONCLUSIONS: Plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of Ferula gummosa plant essential oil compared to NaOCl and CHX: a preliminary in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The usage of medicinal plants as natural antimicrobial agents has grown in many fields including dental medicine. The aim of this in vitro study was three-fold: (i) to determine the chemical compositions of the Ferula gummosa essential oil (FGEO), (ii) to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of the oil with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine (CHX), (iii) to assess the toxic behavior of FGEO in different concentrations compared to 5% NaOCl and 0.2% CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to determine the chemical compositions of the oil. The disk diffusion method and a broth micro-dilution susceptibility assay were exploited to assess the antimicrobial efficacy against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, and Candida albicans. The cytocompatibility of the FGEO was assessed on L929 fibroblasts, and compared to that of NaOCl and CHX. RESULTS: Twenty-seven constituents were recognized in FGEO. The major component of the oil was beta-pinene (51.83%). All three irrigants significantly inhibited the growth of all examined microorganisms compared to the negative control group. FGEO at 50 microg/mL was effective in lower concentration against Enterococcus faecalis than 5% NaOCl and 0.2% CHX, and was also more potent than 0.2% CHX against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. FGEO was a cytocompatible solution, and had significantly lower toxicity compared to 5% NaOCl and 0.2% CHX. CONCLUSIONS: FGEO showed a promising biological potency as a root canal disinfectant. More investigations are required on the effectiveness of this oil on intracanal bacterial biofilms.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial and antifungal activity of new calcium-based cement (Biodentine) compared to MTA and glass ionomer cement.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties of calcium-based cement, Biodentine (Ca3SiO2), compared to commercial glass ionomer cements (GICs) and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pellets of GICs, ProRoot MTA, and Biodentine were prepared to test the influence of these cements on the growth of four oral microbial strains: Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans; using agar diffusion method. Wells were formed by removing the agar and the manipulated materials were immediately placed in the wells. The pellets were lodged in seeded plates and the growth inhibition diameter around the material was measured after 24-72 h incubation at 37 degrees C. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. RESULTS: Test indicates that the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine, on all the microorganisms tested, was very strong, showing a mean inhibition zone of 3.2 mm, which extends over time towards all the strains. For Biodentine, GIC, and MTA, the diameters of the inhibition zones for S. mutans were significantly larger than for E. faecalis, Candida, and E. coli (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for GIC on Candida. Largest inhibition zone was observed for Streptococcus group. Biodentine created larger inhibition zones than MTA and GIC.
TI  - Isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. The aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (S1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (S2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (S3). METHODS: Bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root canals. Samples were inoculated into culture media at a pH of 9 and incubated anaerobically. The identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. RESULTS: All S1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a pH of 9. Gram-positive bacteria Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus and Streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. Of 13 culture-positive S2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a pH of 9, namely Streptococcus sanguinis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Streptococcus oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at S1. All 3 culture-positive S3 samples tolerated a pH of 9, namely S. sanguinis and E. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding S1 and S2 samples. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the presence of alkaline-tolerant Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of Gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - A revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Telavancin activity was assessed against Gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. A total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the Telavancin International Surveillance Program for the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/mL, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/mL (revised FDA breakpoint). Telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All 692 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/mL) at </=0.25 mug/mL (FDA breakpoint), except for 1 strain (MIC, 0.5 mug/mL). All Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis with telavancin MIC values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/mL, respectively, had a VanA phenotype. A comparison data analysis based on the MIC90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Streptococci showed telavancin MIC50 values of </=0.015 mug/mL, except for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50, 0.03 mug/mL). These in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF 7.
AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of Solanum trilobatum. The aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. The bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. In addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7) using MTT, nuclear morphology assay, Western blot and RT-PCR expression. These results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using S. trilobatum fruits.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and stability of electron beam irradiated dental irrigants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The electron beam (e-beam) radiation is considered as an effective means of sterilization of healthcare products as well as to induce the structural changes in the pharmaceutical agents/drug molecules. In addition to structural changes of pharmaceutical it also induces the formation of low molecular weight compounds with altered microbiological, physicochemical and toxicological properties. Among the several known medicaments, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) are used as irrigants in dentistry to kill the pathogenic microorganisms like Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans inhabiting the oral cavity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and stability of e-beam irradiated dental irrigants, NaOCl and CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two dental irrigants NaOCl (1.25% and 2.5%) and CHX (1% and 2%) were exposed to various doses of e-beam radiation. The antimicrobial activities of e-beam irradiated irrigants were compared with the non-irradiated (control) irrigants against E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. mutans and C. albicans by disc diffusion method. Following the storage, physico-chemical properties of the irrigants were recorded and the cytotoxic effect was evaluated on human gingival fibroblast cells. RESULT: The irrigants, 1.25% NaOCl and 1% CHX showed significantly increased antimicrobial activity against both E. faecalis, (16+0.0) and S. aureus (25+0.0) after irradiation with 1 kGy e-beam. Whereas, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX showed slightly increased antimicrobial activity only against S. aureus (28+0.0). The significant difference was noticed in the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of irradiated and non-irradiated irrigants following the storage for 180 d at 4(0)C. CONCLUSION: The e-beam irradiation increased the antimicrobial activity of irrigants without altering the biocompatibility.
TI  - Characterisation of the efficacy of endodontic medications using a three-dimensional fluorescent tooth model: An ex vivo study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a three-dimensional fluorescent tooth  model to investigate bacterial viability against intra-canal medicaments across the thickness and surface of root dentine. Dental microbial biofilms (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans) were established on the external root surface and bacterial kill was monitored over time against intra-canal medicament (Ca(OH)2 ) using fluorescent microscopy in conjunction with BacLight SYTO9 and propidium iodide stains. An Olympus digital camera fitted to SZX16 fluorescent microscope captured images of bacterial cells in biofilms on the external root surface. Viability of biofilm was measured by calculating the total pixel area of green (viable bacteria) and red (non-viable bacteria) for each image using ImageJ(R) software. All data generated were assessed for normality and then analysed using a Mann-Whitney t-test. The viability of S. mutans biofilm following Ca(OH)2 treatment showed a significant decline compared with the untreated group (P = 0.0418). No significant difference was seen for E. faecalis biofilm between the Ca(OH)2 and untreated groups indicating Ca(OH)2 medicament is ineffective against E. faecalis biofilm. This novel three-dimensional fluorescent biofilm model provides a new clinically relevant tool for testing of medicaments against dental biofilms.
TI  - The new Schiff base 4-[(4-Hydroxy-3-fluoro-5-methoxy-benzylidene)amino]-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dih ydro-pyrazol-3-one: experimental, DFT calculational studies and in vitro antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The synthesized Schiff base, 4-[(4-Hydroxy-3-fluoro-5-methoxy-benzylidene)amino]-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dih ydro-pyrazol-3-one (I), has been characterized by (13)C NMR, (1)H NMR, 2D NMR ((1)H-(1)H COSY and (13)C APT), FT-IR, UV-vis and X-ray single-crystal techniques. Molecular geometry of the compound I in the ground state, vibrational frequencies and chemical shift values have been calculated by using the density functional method (DFT) with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The obtained results indicate that optimized geometry can well reflect the crystal structural parameters. The differences between experimental and calculated results of FT-IR and NMR have supported the existence of intermolecular (O-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO type) and intramolecular (C-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO type) hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), frontier molecular orbital analysis (HOMO-LUMO) and electronic absorption spectra were carried out at B3LYP/6-311G++(d,p). HOMO-LUMO electronic transition of 3.92eV is due to contribution of the bands the n-->pi *. The antimicrobial activity of the compound I was determined against the selected 11 bacteria and 8 fungi by microdilution broth assay with Alamar Blue. In vitro studies showed that the compound I has no antifungal effect for selected fungal isolates. However, the compound I shows remarkable antibacterial effect for the bacteria; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.
AB  - Prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), E. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and S. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. Oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. While the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. By using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. Staphylococcus aureus and A. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. They localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high numbers, and suppressed the growth of A. oris and S. mutants. Enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas E. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. In conclusion, it is possible for selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. Moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.
TI  - Synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. The treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1% proteinase K and 2% CHX (with and without ultrasonics). 2% CHX was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (P < 0.05). The viable counts of the proteinase K and CHX group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu mL-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/- 1.36 log10 cfu mL-1 ) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) as compared with the untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu mL-1 ). The CHX group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase K. CONCLUSION: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of Rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ethanolic extract of rose (Rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterized AgNPs showed an effective antibacterial activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) than Gram positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. MTT assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. In addition, green synthesized AgNPs also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (O2(-) and NO) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  - Guedes-Pinto paste is the filling material most employed in Brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the Rifocort(R) ointment has been removed. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace Rifocort(R) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: Nebacetin(R) ointment, 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate gel, and Maxitrol(R) ointment. A paste composed of Iodoform, Rifocort(R) ointment and Camphorated Paramonochlorophenol (CPC) was employed as the gold standard (G1). The other associations were: Iodoform, Nebacetin(R) ointment and CPC (G2); Iodoform, 2% Chlorhexidine Digluconate gel and CPC (G3); Iodoform, Maxitrol(R) ointment and CPC (G4). The associations were tested for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. The results were tested using statistical analysis ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis. They showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with G1. S. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of Tukey), insofar as G2 and G3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. All associations were bactericidal for E. coli, S. aureus, S. mutans and S. oralis. Only G3 and G4 were bactericidal for E. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for B. subtilis. Thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.
TI  - Isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  - Endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. To clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16S rDNA full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: Bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Staphlococcus aureus (33%), S. Epidermidis (75%), Micrococcus luteus (25%), Kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: Neisseria mucosa (58%), Streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Lactococus lactis (33%), Escherichia coli (92%), Salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: S. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: N.mucosa (67%); anus: L. lactis (33%), E. coli (100%). These results indicate that S. epidermidis, N. mucosa, L. lactis and E. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, S. aureus, M. luteus, K. gibsonii, E. faecalis and S. typhosa were species-specific flora. This study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of PGLa-AM1, CPF-AM1, and magainin-AM1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (HDPs). Three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-AM1), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AM1) and magainin-AM1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the African volcano frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by microbroth dilution. PGLa-AM1 and CPF-AM1 were particularly active against Streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. A type strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. PGLa-AM1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All three peptides showed less binding to P. gingivalis LPS than to LPS from the other species studied. Oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 muM peptide treatments. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 muM magainin-AM1 but not following treatment with PGLa-AM1 or CPF-AM1. In conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the X. amieti peptides bound to LPS from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.
TI  - Antibacterial compounds from Salvia adenophora Fernald (Lamiaceae).
AB  - From the aerial parts of Salvia adenophora Fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. Compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. The structures were established by extensive 1D, 2D NMR and HRESI-TOFMS spectroscopic methods. Finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ECD spectra. Despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on Gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, Staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against S. epidermidis. Interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. No action was reported on Gram-negative strains nor on Candida albicans. These results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.
TI  - An in vivo comparison of internal bacterial colonization in two dental implant systems: identification of a pathogenic reservoir.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare internal bacterial colonization  in two implant systems, one screw root form (SRF) with an external hexagon connection and one plateau root form (PRF) with a Morse taper internal connection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two implants; 12 SRF and 20 PRF, were sampled in 15 patients. All implants had been in function for at least 6 months prior to sampling. The implant restoration was removed and 10 microl of sterile saline was introduced into the implant well via a sterile glass syringe. The saline was drawn back up and transferred to the laboratory for microbiological analysis. The number of aerobic and anaerobic colony forming units per millilitre was determined and the dominant micro-organism in each sample was identified by 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between bleeding on probing around the SRF implants (3%) and the PRF implants (28%) (p = 0.0496). Bacterial colonization was identified at 11 SRF and 19 PRF implants. The numbers of anaerobic bacteria recovered from PRF implants was significantly higher than that from SRF implants (p = 0.0002). Streptococcus species and Enterococcus faecalis were found to dominate. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study demonstrated bacterial colonization in both types of implant systems, irrespective of the type of connection. Significantly greater anaerobic counts were found in the Morse taper internal connection implants.
TI  - Bacteriocin protein BacL1 of Enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes L-Ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, BacL1 and BacA. We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Baseline activity of telavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in U.S. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher MIC values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). Streptococci showed telavancin modal MIC results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against Streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). This study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the United States (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of two root canal sealers: MTA Fillapex and AH 26.
AB  - AIM: Even after a complete root canal therapy, reinfection may occur as a result  of incomplete seal and activation of residual bacteria. Thus, antimicrobial activity is an important characteristic of root canal sealers. MTA Fillapex is a newly developed MTA-based sealer. It has been subjected to various studies evaluating its physical and chemical properties. In this study, we aimed to compare the antimicrobial activity of this sealer to the commonly known widely accepted sealer, AH26. METHODS: MTA Fillapex and AH 26 were exposed the bacterial suspension of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans after setting. After incubation and complete evaporation, BHI was added to microtubes. 24 hours later, the liquid content was placed in agar diffusion plate and bacterial count was performed. ANOVA followed by Tukey test, and t-Test were performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: With regard to all four bacterial groups, the bacterial count was significantly lower in MTAFillapex group comparing to AH 26 group. CONCLUSION: Newly developed MTA Fillapex sealer, has better antimicrobial properties in comparison to the widely accepted AH26 sealer.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive pathogens isolated in Canadian hospital laboratories from 2011 to 2013.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens isolated in 15 Canadian hospital laboratories between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility to oritavancin and comparative antimicrobial agents using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Oritavancin demonstrated in vitro activity equivalent to, or more potent than, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against the isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=1460; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.7% oritavancin-susceptible), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n=427; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.5% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=132; oritavancin MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL; 99.2% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=156; oritavancin MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL; 100% oritavancin-susceptible), and Enterococcus faecalis (n=304; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 98.7% oritavancin-susceptible) tested.
TI  - Antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (PDT) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during root canal treatment. The aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (CSRBnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. METHODS: The interaction of CSRBnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. Their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (OD260nm) using Enterococcus faecalis. The penetration of CSRBnps into E. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Multispecies biofilms of Streptococcus oralis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. The biofilms were subjected to PDT (60 J/cm(2)) using CSRBnps and rose bengal. The treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and CLSM. RESULTS: The CSRBnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. Atomic force microscopy showed adherence of CSRBnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after PDT. CSRBnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (P < .05). CSRBnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. Scanning electron microscopy and CLSM confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on Ricinus communis.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a Ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was performed with R. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. Only E. coli was not inhibited by R. communis, but the MIC (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. From these results it was determined the R. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. The commercial dentifrices Colgate, Trihydral and Corega Brite were tested for comparative purposes. The diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). Neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against E. coli. The experimental dentifrices containing R. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against S. mutans, S. aureaus and E. faecallis. The experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. and E. coli in any of the tested concentrations. Trihydral was the most effective. Comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% R. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against S. aureus.
TI  - Plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  - Autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. The rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. In addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. In this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. The antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. Results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus oralis and Staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. The findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.
TI  - Construction of a chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - Developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. In the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (Ply187N-V12C) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (Ply187N) of the bacteriophage lysin Ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, V12C) of the lysin PlyV12. The results showed that the chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C had not only lytic activity similar to Ply187N against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which Ply187N could not lyse. Our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.
TI  - The effect of sodium hypochlorite on Enterococcus faecalis when grown on dentine  as a single- and multi-species biofilm.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is often involved in the aetiology of apical periodontitis  after endodontic treatment. This project aimed to establish, on dentine in vitro, a multi-species biofilm containing E. faecalis, and to determine if the organism had an increased resistance to sodium hypochlorite compared with an axenic biofilm. Biofilms were established on dentine discs in flow cells with either E. faecalis alone (axenic) or together with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus sanguinis. Following treatment with either 0.9% sodium hypochlorite or saline, the viability of E. faecalis was determined by serial plating and qualitative analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Viable counts indicated that 0.9% NaOCl is highly effective against E. faecalis grown alone and as part of a multi-species biofilm (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.001, respectively). No significant difference in its survival in the two biofilm types was found (P = 0.8276).
TI  - Control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain Enterococcus faecalis EF37 and the histamine producing strain Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). The results showed that the three L. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 and EG46 produced, respectively, nisin Z and lacticin 481, while for the strains CG27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. The co-culture of E. faecalis EF37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of E. faecalis. Tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when E. faecalis EF37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. All the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with E. faecalis EF37; in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 induced the death of S. thermophilus PRI60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). The other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against S. thermophilus PRI60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if L. lactis subsp. lactis EG46 was less effective when the initial streptococci concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. This preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate BA and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on BA production on the same strain. This knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Streptococcus agalactiae isolates harboring small erm(T)-carrying plasmids.
AB  - Among 1,827 group B Streptococcus (GBS) strains collected between 2006 and 2013 by the French National Reference Center for Streptococci, 490 (26.8%) strains were erythromycin resistant. The erm(T) resistance gene was found in six strains belonging to capsular polysaccharides Ia, III, and V and was carried by the same mobilizable plasmid, which could be efficiently transferred by mobilization to GBS and Enterococcus faecalis recipients, thus promoting a broad dissemination of erm(T).
TI  - Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  - The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of </=10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants.
TI  - Inspecting the potential physiological and biomedical value of 44 conserved uncharacterised proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major Gram-positive coccoid pathogens cause similar invasive diseases and show high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Uncharacterised proteins shared by these organisms may be involved in virulence or be targets for antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Forty four uncharacterised proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae with homologues in Enterococcus faecalis and/or Staphylococcus aureus were selected for analysis. These proteins showed differences in terms of sequence conservation and number of interacting partners. Twenty eight of these proteins were monodomain proteins and 16 were modular, involving domain combinations and, in many cases, predicted unstructured regions. The genes coding for four of these 44 proteins were essential. Genomic and structural studies showed one of the four essential genes to code for a promising antibacterial target. The strongest impact of gene removal was on monodomain proteins showing high sequence conservation and/or interactions with many other proteins. Eleven out of 40 knockouts (one for each gene) showed growth delay and 10 knockouts presented a chaining phenotype. Five of these chaining mutants showed a lack of putative DNA-binding proteins. This suggest this phenotype results from a loss of overall transcription regulation. Five knockouts showed defective autolysis in response to penicillin and vancomycin, and attenuated virulence in an animal model of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Uncharacterised proteins make up a reservoir of polypeptides of different physiological importance and biomedical potential. A promising antibacterial target was identified. Five of the 44 examined proteins seemed to be virulence factors.
TI  - Antibacterial peptide nisin: a potential role in the inhibition of oral pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Although the antimicrobial peptide nisin has been extensively studied in the food industry for decades, its application in the oral cavity remains to develop and evaluate its feasibility in treating oral common diseases. Nisin is an odorless, colorless, tasteless substance with low toxicity and with antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria. These biologic properties may establish its use in promising products for oral diseases. This article summarizes the antibacterial efficiency of nisin against pathogenic bacteria related to dental caries and root canal infection and discusses the combination of nisin and common oral drugs.
TI  - Microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. METHODOLOGY: Apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the Kyushu University Hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. DNA was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and specific fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were P. gingivalis (19.9%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and Propionibacterium acnes (9%). Bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. In addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113, Olsenella uli, Slackia exigua, Selemonas infelix, P. gingivalis with type IV fimA, and a combination of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113 and predominance of Streptococcus spp. On the other hand, neither Enterococcus faecalis nor C. albicans were detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSION: Whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. The diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.
TI  - vanG element insertions within a conserved chromosomal site conferring vancomycin resistance to Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus anginosus.
AB  - Three vancomycin-resistant streptococcal strains carrying vanG elements (two invasive Streptococcus agalactiae isolates [GBS-NY and GBS-NM, both serotype II and multilocus sequence type 22] and one Streptococcus anginosus [Sa]) were examined. The 45,585-bp elements found within Sa and GBS-NY were nearly identical (together designated vanG-1) and shared near-identity over an ~15-kb overlap with a previously described vanG element from Enterococcus faecalis. Unexpectedly, vanG-1 shared much less homology with the 49,321-bp vanG-2 element from GBS-NM, with widely different levels (50% to 99%) of sequence identity shared among 44 related open reading frames. Immediately adjacent to both vanG-1 and vanG-2 were 44,670-bp and 44,680-bp integrative conjugative element (ICE)-like sequences, designated ICE-r, that were nearly identical in the two group B streptococcal (GBS) strains. The dual vanG and ICE-r elements from both GBS strains were inserted at the same position, between bases 1328 and 1329, within the identical RNA methyltransferase (rumA) genes. A GenBank search revealed that although most GBS strains contained insertions within this specific site, only sequence type 22 (ST22) GBS strains contained highly related ICE-r derivatives. The vanG-1 element in Sa was also inserted within this position corresponding to its rumA homolog adjacent to an ICE-r derivative. vanG-1 insertions were previously reported within the same relative position in the E. faecalis rumA homolog. An ICE-r sequence perfectly conserved with respect to its counterpart in GBS-NY was apparent within the same site of the rumA homolog of a Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain. Additionally, homologous vanG-like elements within the conserved rumA target site were evident in Roseburia intestinalis. Importance: These three streptococcal strains represent the first known vancomycin-resistant strains of their species. The collective observations made from these strains reveal a specific hot spot for insertional elements that is conserved between streptococci and different Gram-positive species. The two GBS strains potentially represent a GBS lineage that is predisposed to insertion of vanG elements.
TI  - Using color histograms and SPA-LDA to classify bacteria.
AB  - In this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, and Staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the Successive Projections Algorithm associated with Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA). In this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (RGB), hue-saturation-value (HSV), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (Soft Independent Modeling by Class Analogy (SIMCA), Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Successive Projections Algorithm-Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA)). The bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. The best result in classification was obtained by using RGB and SPA-LDA, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. This result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using Gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. Therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.
TI  - Revised reference broth microdilution method for testing telavancin: effect on MIC results and correlation with other testing methodologies.
AB  - The reference broth microdilution (BMD) antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for telavancin was revised to include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent and diluent for frozen-form panel preparation, following the CLSI recommendations for water-insoluble agents. Polysorbate 80 (P-80) was also added to the test medium to minimize proven drug losses associated with binding to plastic surfaces. Four hundred sixty-two Gram-positive isolates, including a challenge set of organisms with reduced susceptibilities to comparator agents, were selected and tested using the revised method for telavancin, and the MIC results were compared with those tested by the previously established method and several Sensititre dry-form BMD panel formulations. The revised method provided MIC results 2- to 8-fold lower than the previous method when tested against staphylococci and enterococci, resulting in MIC50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 mug/ml for staphylococci and 0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml for Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Less-significant MIC decreases (1 to 2 log2 dilution steps) were observed when testing streptococci in broth supplemented with blood, which showed similar MIC50 values for both methods. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae had MIC50 results of 0.008 and 0.03 mug/ml when tested by the revised and previous methods, respectively. Highest essential agreement rates (>/=94.0%) were noted for one candidate dry-form panel formulation compared to the revised test. The revised BMD method provides lower MIC results for telavancin, especially when tested against staphylococci and enterococci. This is secondary to the use of DMSO for panel production and the presence of P-80, which ensure the proper telavancin testing concentration and result in a more accurate MIC determination. Moreover, earlier studies where the previous method was applied underestimated the in vitro drug potency.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Azadirachta indica, Mimusops elengi, Tinospora cardifolia, Ocimum sanctum and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate on common endodontic pathogens: An in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To check the antimicrobial activity of Azadirachta indica (Neem), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi), Mimusops elelngi (Bakul), Tinospora cardifolia (Giloy) and Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHX) on common endodontic pathogens like Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion test was used to check the antimicrobial activity of the Methanolic extracts of the medicinal plants along with CHX. Six different concentrations of the tested agents were used for the study. The values of Zone of Inhibition were tabulated according to the concentration of the tested agent and data was statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni post- hoc tests. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) values were also recorded. RESULTS: All the plants extracts showed considerable antimicrobial activity against selected endodontic pathogens. At 3mg. concentration, O.sanctum was the most effective against S. mutans, M. elengi showed highest zone of inhibition against E.faecalis, whereas CHX was the most effective agent against S.aureus. CHX was also the most consistent of all the medicaments testes, showing inhibitory effect against all the tree pathogens at all the selected concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The Methanolic extract of A.Indica, O.sanctum, M. Elengi, T.cardifolia and Chlorhexidine Gluconate has considerable antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, E. faecalis and S. aureus.
TI  - Effect of addition of 2% chlorhexidine or 10% doxycycline on antimicrobial activity of biodentine.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the addition of  2% chlorhexidine gluconate or 10% doxycycline would enhance the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC-29212), Candida albicans (ATCC-90028), and Streptococcus mutans (MTCC-497). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three wells of 4 mm diameter and 4 mm depth on each plate were prepared on the agar medium with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. Biodentine powder mixed with 2% chlorhexidine (0.06 g) or 10% doxycycline (0.30 g) in its liquid or liquid alone was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. The data were analyzed using independent "t" test to compare the differences among the three cement preparations for different micro-organisms. RESULTS: All Biodentine samples inhibited microbial growth. The highest mean diameters of zone of inhibition for all the micro-organisms were found around Biodentine/chlorhexidine (13.417) followed by Biodentine alone (12.236) and Biodentine/doxycycline (11.25). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, adding 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in liquid of Biodentine enhanced the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine against all the tested micro-organisms except Candida albicans, while addition of 10% doxycycline decreased the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine. The differences were significant statistically (P < 0.05).
TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Quality control MIC ranges used for telavancin with application of a revised CLSI reference broth microdilution method.
AB  - The telavancin broth microdilution susceptibility testing method was revised, which provides MIC results lower than those obtained by the previous method. This study was performed to reestablish the quality control ranges for telavancin when tested against the strains (updated MIC range) Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.03 to 0.12 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03 to 0.12 mug/ml), and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml).
TI  - Determination of kinetics and the crystal structure of a novel type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) is a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and is required for all organisms that synthesize isoprenoid metabolites from mevalonate. Type 1 IDI (IDI-1) is a metalloprotein that is found in eukaryotes, whereas the type 2 isoform (IDI-2) is a flavoenzyme found in bacteria that is completely absent from human. IDI-2 from the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme indicated that FMNH2 (KM =0.3 muM) bound before isopentenyl diphosphate (KM =40 muM) in an ordered binding mechanism. An X-ray crystal structure at 1.4 A resolution was obtained for the holoenzyme in the closed conformation with a reduced flavin cofactor and two sulfate ions in the active site. These results helped to further approach the enzymatic mechanism of IDI-2 and, thus, open new possibilities for the rational design of antibacterial compounds against sequence-similar and structure-related pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Potent oxazolidinone antibacterials with heteroaromatic C-ring substructure.
AB  - Novel oxazolidinone analogues bearing a condensed heteroaromatic ring as the C-ring substructure were synthesized as candidate antibacterial agents. Analogues 16 and 21 bearing imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and 18 and 23 bearing [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine as the C-ring had excellent in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). They also showed promising therapeutic effects in a mouse model of lethal infection. Preliminary safety data (inhibitory effects on cytochrome P450 isoforms and monoamine oxidases) were satisfactory. Further evaluation of 18 and 23 is ongoing.
TI  - Improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-II photosensitizers.
AB  - Increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. This demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB) uses light activated photosensitizers (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. Positively charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of PS for light-mediated killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield PhiDelta of >97%. Upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase C8, 1260 +/- 50 mW/cm(2)) the PS showed high activity against the oral key pathogens Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. At a concentration of 10 muM, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 J/cm(2)) after one single treatment. The pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.
TI  - Characterisation of the antibacterial effect of polyethyleneimine nanoparticles in relation to particle distribution in resin composite.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterise the antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating cross-linked quaternised polyethyleneimine (QPEI) nanoparticles in relation to their distribution in the bulk material. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating QPEI nanoparticle was tested against various oral pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscousus, Lactobacilus casei and whole saliva. Nanoparticle distribution in the modified resin composite was assessed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the degree of conversion was recorded. RESULTS: Total bacterial inhibition was detected against all the tested pathogens following direct contact with the outer surface of the modified resin composite. Similarly, the inner surface of the modified resin composite caused total inhibition. Electron microscope images showed bacterial death. XPS revealed surface I(-) ions on both the outer and the inner surfaces of the modified composite. No I(-) ions were detected in the unmodified composite. Nanoparticle distribution was higher on the inner surface of the modified composite. The composite's degree of conversion was unaffected by nanoparticle addition. CONCLUSIONS: QPEI nanoparticles represent a new generation of antibacterial nanoparticles which are highly promising in preventing bacterial recontamination when restoring teeth.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in Dhaka City, Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. We planned to find out the prevalent microbial strains causing UTI in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Urine sample was collected from 462 UTI suspected female subjects. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. A higher incidence (16.8%) of UTI was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. Escherichia coli (69%), Streptococcus spp. (15%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to Enterococcus faecalis (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and Hafnia alvei (2%). The E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. Isolated strains of E. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. CONCLUSION: The extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. This study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the UTI pathogens to reduce the morbidity of female UTI patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - The elongation of ovococci.
AB  - The morphogenesis of ovococci has been reviewed extensively. Recent results have  provided new insights concerning the mechanisms of elongation in ovoid bacteria. We present here the proteins involved in the elongation (firmly established and more or less hypothetical) and discuss the relationship between elongation and division of ovococci.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in New Zealand: data from the International Collaboration  on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study.
AB  - AIMS: The International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS) collected worldwide data on the presentation, management and outcome of infective endocarditis (IE). We present data from patients with endocarditis enrolled from New Zealand. METHODS: Patients who fulfilled the Duke criteria for definite or probable endocarditis were enrolled from five district health boards: Auckland, Counties Manukau, Waitemata, Capital and Coast, and Canterbury, between June 2000 and September 2005. RESULTS: There were 336 New Zealand patients enrolled in the ICE-PCS. Prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred in 31%. Underlying medical conditions were present in 28% of patients, but only 4% of patients had rheumatic heart disease. Forty patients (12%) had healthcare-associated endocarditis. Viridans streptococci were the most common cause of IE (32%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (24%). Patients with S. aureus IE were more likely to present within a week of symptom onset than those with viridans streptococcus IE (OR 4.18, 95% CI 2.36-7.42). Surgery was performed in 33% of patients. In total, 20 patients (6%) died in hospital. Those with endocarditis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci had an increased risk of death compared with those viridans streptococcus endocarditis (RR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-17). The risk of stroke was higher in those with endocarditis caused by S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.05, and 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-13, respectively). CONCLUSION: While viridans streptococci remain the predominant causative organisms of IE in New Zealand, many 'traditional' clinical and management aspects of this disease no longer apply. This paper provides a reference for local practitioners assessing and managing IE.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - The Physiology and Metabolism of Enterococci
AB  - When possible, the authors have provided open reading frame (ORF) numbers (EF####) from the extensively annotated E. faecalis V583 genome sequence. This information can be easily accessed at enterocyc.broadinstitute.org. If applicable, non-V583 enterococcal sequences with homology to the annotated ORF have been supplied. Additionally, we have included IUBMB nomenclature for most reactions, which are available at http://www.iubmb.org. Enterococci have been isolated and characterized for more than 113 years (MacCallum & Hastings, 1899). During the past century, the classification of this genus has been refined, with the most significant change occurring in 1984 when most members of the Group D streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium, were included in the new genus Enterococcus (Schleifer & Kilpper-Balz, 1984). This genus currently consists of 37 species that occupy a broad range of habitats that include the gastrointestinal microbiota of nearly every animal phylum (See Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization for details). An ability to widely colonize is due, at least in part, to their metabolic versatility and intrinsic resistance to inhospitable conditions. Despite being unable to form spores, enterococci are highly tolerant to desiccation and can persist for months on dried surfaces. Enterococci also tolerate extremes of pH, ionizing radiation, osmotic and oxidative stresses, high heavy metal concentrations, and antibiotics. Enterococci survive or grow over a wide range of temperatures for mesophilic bacteria, from 10 to 45 degrees C. These bacteria, as highly evolved commensals, have been extensively used in the food industry and as probiotics to prevent or ameliorate disease. Finally, rogue strains of enterococci have emerged on the worldwide stage as multidrug-resistant and hospital-acquired pathogens. Enterococci are often simply described as lactic-acid-producing bacteria-a designation that understates their vast metabolic potential. The ubiquitous nature of enterococci in our environment implies this potential. Investigations into the remarkable physiology of these bacteria have fluctuated over the past century. Prior to publication of The Enterococci (Huycke M. M., 2002), and now with this volume, the last formal comprehensive review of enterococcal metabolism was written in 1964 (Deibel, 1964). At that time, substantial efforts by Gunsalus, Sokatch, Gale, Niven, and Deibel, among others, focused on the central metabolism of enterococci. Since then, research into enterococcal physiology has increasingly used the tools of molecular biology and has shifted toward understanding antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and genomics. With this new information, there has been increasing recognition that many metabolic genes and pathways vary, even within single species, and led investigators to question the concept of a uniform core metabolism for enterococci. To address this perspective and update the available information on enterococcal physiology, this chapter compiles and reviews the most recent findings from laboratories around the world, and integrates those results with the older literature. As will be evident, the rapid growth of genomic databases continues to offer valuable insights into the physiology of enterococci and greatly facilitates experimental designs into their metabolism.
TI  - Characterization of aid1, a novel gene involved in Fusobacterium nucleatum interspecies interactions.
AB  - The oral opportunistic pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum is known to interact with a large number of different bacterial species residing in the oral cavity. It adheres to a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including oral streptococci via the arginine-inhibitable adhesin RadD. In this study, we describe a novel protein encoded by the predicted open reading frame FN1253 that appears to play a role in interspecies interactions of F. nucleatum, particularly with oral streptococci and related Gram-positive species. We designated FN1253 as aid1 (Adherence Inducing Determinant 1). Expression analyses demonstrated that this gene was induced in F. nucleatum single species biofilms, while the presence of representative members of the oral microbiota known to adhere to F. nucleatum triggered its suppression. Inactivation as well as overexpression of aid1 affected the ability of F. nucleatum to coaggregate with oral streptococci and the closely related Enterococcus faecalis, but not other Gram-positive oral species tested. Furthermore, overexpression of aid1 led to a drastic change in the structure of dual species biofilms of F. nucleatum with oral streptococci. Aid1 function was abolished in the presence of arginine and found to be dependent on RadD. Interestingly, differential expression of aid1 did not affect messenger RNA and protein levels of RadD. These findings indicate that RadD-mediated adhesion to oral streptococci involves more complex cellular processes than the simple interaction of adhesins on the surface of partner strains. Aid1 could potentially play an important role in facilitating RadD-mediated interaction with oral streptococci by increasing binding specificity of F. nucleatum to other microbial species.
TI  - Impact of Staphylococcus aureus on pathogenesis in polymicrobial infections.
AB  - Polymicrobial infections involving Staphylococcus aureus exhibit enhanced disease severity and morbidity. We reviewed the nature of polymicrobial interactions between S. aureus and other bacterial, fungal, and viral cocolonizers. Microbes that were frequently recovered from the infection site with S. aureus are Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Candida albicans, and influenza virus. Detailed analyses of several in vitro and in vivo observations demonstrate that S. aureus exhibits cooperative relations with C. albicans, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, and influenza virus and competitive relations with P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp., and Corynebacterium sp. Interactions of both types influence changes in S. aureus that alter its characteristics in terms of colony formation, protein expression, pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility.
TI  - In vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. The role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efficacy of three oral rinses, Acclean, Noplak and Prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. Oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an MTT assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an XTT assay. RESULTS: The two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio lm-grown organisms when compared to the Prevention oral rinse. CONCLUSION: Both Acclean and Noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. In addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. All samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia bacteria. First group was treated with Aseptim Plus(R) photo-activated (LED) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm Diode Laser and Toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) using EDTA 17% and NaOCl 2.6% solutions. The working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. Presence or absence of biofilm was assessed by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by Aseptim Plus(R) and Diode Laser (P<0.6267). In cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. The group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and NaOCl and EDTA solutions had the best results (P<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. CONCLUSION: Under the condition of this study, Photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem. Patients can benefit from an open dialogue between both cardiologists and gastroenterologists for the optimal effective patients care. The focused update on infective endocarditis of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (IE) as not recommended for gastroscopy and colonoscopy in the absence of active infection but increasing evidence suggests that the role of IE antibiotic prophylaxis remains a dark side of the cardio-oncology prevention. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and new findings indicate that there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem.The focused update on infective endocarditis of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis as not recommended for urinary tract procedures in the absence of active infection. A statistical association has been recently shown between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Actinobaculum schaalii, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and new findings indicate there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - A Comparison between Antibacterial Activity of Propolis and Aloe vera on Enterococcus faecalis (an In Vitro Study).
AB  - Removing the bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, from the root canal is one of the important aims in endodontic treatment.We aimed to compare the antibacterial activity of Chlorhexidine with two natural drugs. The antibacterial activities of three different propolis extracts (alcohol concentrations: 0, 15, 40%) and Aloe vera gel on E. faecalis were compared using three methods: disk diffusion, microdilution and direct contact test. In addition to the above bacterium, the Aloe vera gel effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans was evaluated. Disk diffusion test revealed that propolis ethanolic extracts (the alcohol concentration of 15 and 40%) and Aloe vera gel have antibacterial activities but aqueous extract of propolis did not show any effect in this test. The MICs for propolis ethanolic extracts, Aloe vera gel and aqueous extract of propolis (0% alcohol) were 313 microg/ml, 750 microg/ml, 2250 microg/ml, and >/= 500 microg/ml respectively, much higher than the Chlorhexidine one. In direct contact test, contrary to Aloe vera, all three propolis extracts showed antibacterial effects on E. faecalis. The Aloe vera gel also showed significant antibacterial effect on S.aureus and S.mutans. The hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis and Aloe vera gel had antibacterial effects on E. faecalis, however, propolis is more potent than Aloe vera. The antibacterial effect of Aloe vera on S. aureus and S. mutans is low (MIC >/= 2250 microg/ml). Appropriate concentrations of alcoholic extracts of propolis and some fractions of Aloe vera gel might be good choices for disinfecting the root canal in endodontic treatments.
TI  - Mechanism for transfer of transposon Tn2010 carrying macrolide resistance genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae and its effects on genome evolution.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism responsible for the horizontal transfer of transposon Tn2010 in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the genomic alterations introduced by the transfer process. METHODS: Tn2010 was identified using PCR in 15 clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae with erythromycin resistance. S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were used as recipient cells in mating and transformation experiments to test the conjugative transferability and transformability of Tn2010. Whole-genome sequencing was used to assess the effects of the Tn2010 transfer on recipient genomes. The biological cost of the horizontal acquisition of Tn2010 and additional genomic changes was investigated by growth competition experiments. RESULTS: Tn2010 was transformed at a frequency of 3 x 10(-7) transformants per cfu, whereas no transconjugants were detected using S. pneumoniae or E. faecalis as recipient cells. Genome analysis showed that many other recombinations were scattered throughout the genome of the transformants in addition to transposon Tn2010. The transformants demonstrated a negligible fitness cost compared with the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: Tn2010 tended to be transferred by transformation rather than conjugation in S. pneumoniae, and the spread of Tn2010 could have a profound effect on the evolution of the genome. The acquisition of Tn2010 with negligible fitness cost may facilitate spread of the transposon.
TI  - Comprehensive metagenomic approach for detecting causative microorganisms in culture-negative infective endocarditis.
AB  
TI  - gamma-Alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5H)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae Delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. We have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis. In the present Letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus mutans. Our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. In some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/mL (1.3 muM, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/mL (1.3 muM, 3f). Results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
TI  - Diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. However, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. METHODS: We searched the hospital charts for in-house patients who were treated for PID or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010. In cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. RESULTS: 73 patients with suspected PID or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. Median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7 %) patients had an IUD at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. In 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. In vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), Escherichia coli (22.2 %), Enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and Staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). In eight patients (11 %) Chlamydia trachomatis could be found, there was no case of Neisseria gonorrhea. In 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. In nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. CONCLUSION: In severe cases of PID, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. However, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. In this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. METHODS: Antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin G, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized Etest method (Bio Merieux, Marcy-1'Etoile, France). The antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. Additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. RESULTS: Different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. Five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermentum, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Prevotella buccae, and Propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. Most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.
TI  - Animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.
TI  - Restriction of the conformational dynamics of the cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics improves their antibacterial activity.
AB  - The cyclic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics are a new class of antibacterial agents that kill bacteria via a mechanism that is distinct from all clinically used drugs. These molecules bind and dysregulate the activity of the ClpP peptidase. The potential of these antibiotics as antibacterial drugs has been enhanced by the elimination of pharmacological liabilities through medicinal chemistry efforts. Here, we demonstrate that the ADEP conformation observed in the ADEP-ClpP crystal structure is fortified by transannular hydrogen bonding and can be further stabilized by judicious replacement of constituent amino acids within the peptidolactone core structure with more conformationally constrained counterparts. Evidence supporting constraint of the molecule into the bioactive conformer was obtained by measurements of deuterium-exchange kinetics of hydrogens that were proposed to be engaged in transannular hydrogen bonds. We show that the rigidified ADEP analogs bind and activate ClpP at lower concentrations in vitro. Remarkably, these compounds have up to 1200-fold enhanced antibacterial activity when compared to those with the peptidolactone core structure common to two ADEP natural products. This study compellingly demonstrates how rational modulation of conformational dynamics may be used to improve the bioactivities of natural products.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Forensic interlaboratory evaluation of the ForFLUID kit for vaginal fluids identification.
AB  - Identification of vaginal fluids is an important step in the process of sexual assaults confirmation. Advances in both microbiology and molecular biology defined technical approaches allowing the discrimination of body fluids. These protocols are based on the identification of specific bacterial communities by microfloraDNA (mfDNA) amplification. A multiplex real time-PCR assay (ForFLUID kit) has been developed for identifying biological fluids and for discrimination among vaginal, oral and fecal samples. In order to test its efficacy and reliability of the assay in the identification of vaginal fluids, an interlaboratory evaluation has been performed on homogeneous vaginal swabs. All the involved laboratories were able to correctly recognize all the vaginal swabs, and no false positives were identified when the assay was applied on non-vaginal samples. The assay represents an useful molecular tool that can be easily adopted by forensic geneticists involved in vaginal fluid identification.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteria in human gallstones].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complications caused by lost gallstones within the abdominal cavity are well known. Abscesses, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract were all described in the literature, but gallstones were found in hernial sac, or even in sputum after it penetrated through the diaphragm into the respiratory tract. These complications can develop between several weeks to several years postoperatively. Most complications can be treated surgically only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty gallstones and bile samples were collected from 50 patients who underwent cholecystectomy (36 female / 14 male, avarge age: 60.8 +/- 6.8 years). All samples were sent for microbiological examination. RESULTS: bacterial colonization of the gallstone and the bile were found in 16 cases. Four of them showed acute inflammation in the gallbladder while pathological signs of chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall were detected in eight cases. Empyema was found in four cases. Bacteria from enteral origin (Esherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae) was detected in 13 cases, while non-enteral (Klebsiella penumoniae, Streptococcus alfa-haemoliticus) colony were detected in three cases. Positive bacterial cultures were identified in twelve female and fourmale patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of bacteria can be found in the gallstones, which may cause various complications.
TI  - Prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium from a polymeric fibre  device for the treatment of periodontal disease.
AB  - In vitro analysis of drug release and antimicrobial activity of the coblended crosslinked polymeric fibre device (PFD) were investigated. The fibre loaded with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium was comprised of alginate and glycerol crosslinked with barium cations. The pH dependent drug release was evident with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium diffusing from the fibre at pH 4.0 compared to pH 6.8, where the fibre swelled and eroded resulting in zero-order drug release. Agar diffusion studies followed by minimum inhibitory assays were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the device against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. The antimicrobial activity of the PFD was confirmed in both test assays against all test pathogens. The MIC ranges at pH 4.0 for E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. mutans were 0.5-0.8, 0.4-1.1, and 0.7-2.1 mug/mL, respectively. At pH 6.8, similar efficacies (0.3-0.5 mug/mL for E. coli and E. faecalis and 0.6-1.0 mug/mL for S. mutans) were observed. The effect of varying the plasticizer and crosslinking ion concentration on drug release profile of the fibers was further elucidated and conceptualized using molecular mechanics energy relationships (MMER) and by exploring the spatial disposition of geometrically minimized molecular conformations.
TI  - Antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  - AIM: The study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. The samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Once dispersed samples were taken and Gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. RESULTS: The result showed microflora common in all types, Gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. In normal children Gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were Gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. CONCLUSION: By the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - FRIENDS Group: clinical and microbiological characteristics of post-filtering surgery endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the clinical and microbiological characteristics as well as the prognostic factors for post-filtering surgery endophthalmitis. METHODS: Twenty-three eyes were included in the study in four tertiary centres between 2004 and 2010. The clinical and microbiological data were collected prospectively (minimum follow-up, 6 months). Microbiological diagnosis was based on conventional cultures and panbacterial PCR (16SrDNA amplification and sequencing). RESULTS: The onset of endophthalmitis was early (<6 weeks) in 22 % of the cases and delayed in 78 %. Elevated intraocular pressure and hypopyon were more frequent in delayed than in early presentations (p = 0.04). By combining the results of culture and panbacterial PCR, a bacterial species could be identified in 73.9 % of the cases, including 56.5 % of commensal species of the digestive tract such as Moraxella spp., oropharyngeal streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Good final visual acuity (VA >/= 20/40) was correlated with initial VA greater than light perception (p = 0.05). Poor final VA (</=20/400) was correlated with a higher virulence of the infecting bacterial species (p = 0.006), and was noted in all patients with early-onset endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Acute early- or delayed-onset post-filtering surgery endophthalmitis is frequently caused by bacteria of the digestive tract (e.g., Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp.). The combination of conventional cultures and panbacterial PCR allowed us to identify the causative microorganism in three-quarters of the cases, i.e., 21 % more cases than through culture alone. Despite adequate antibiotic and surgical treatment, the anatomical and visual prognosis remains poor.
TI  - The effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  - AIM: To establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K with or without ultrasonic activation. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. The treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase K, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (with and without ultrasonics). NaOCl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: Nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium pH became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. The CLSM showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. On the disc model, trypsin and proteinase K were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. NaOCl was the most effective agent (P < 0.001). In the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (P < 0.05). Chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase K (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (P < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/- 4.9). CONCLUSION: Trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of alpha-substituted isonipecotic acid benzothiazole analogues as potent bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors.
AB  - The discovery and optimisation of a new class of benzothiazole small molecules that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are described. Antibacterial properties have been demonstrated by activity against DNA gyrase ATPase and potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. Further refinements to the scaffold designed to enhance drug-likeness included analogues bearing an alpha-substituent to the carboxylic acid group, resulting in excellent solubility and favourable pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. METHODS: Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. The mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. After incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (CH), 2% chlorhexidine solution (CHX), and 50 mug/mL HBD3 solution. A commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture of biofilms. The percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. RESULTS: Three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (P < .001). The HBD3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (P < .05). The CH and CHX groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: HBD3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either CH or CHX.

TI  - Lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus mutans interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. Although lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is considered a major virulence factor of Gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to S. mutans LTA. In this study, we purified LTA from S. mutans (Sm.LTA) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. The Sm.LTA preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. Upon exposure to Sm.LTA, the murine macrophage cell-line RAW 264.7 cells produced TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner. Sm.LTA preferentially bound to and activated CHO/CD14/TLR2 cells rather than CHO/CD14/TLR4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing CD14 and TLR2 or CD14 and TLR4, respectively. Sm.LTA could not induce TNF-alpha or NO production in macrophages derived from TLR2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. TLR2-dependent induction of NO by Sm.LTA was also confirmed in RAW 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking TLR2. Furthermore, Sm.LTA deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated TLR2 nor induced TNF-alpha or NO production, suggesting that Sm.LTA lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of Sm.LTA. Unlike Staphylococcus aureus LTA, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, Sm.LTA showed a modest induction of NO production comparable to LTAs of other oral bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus plantarum. In conclusion, our results suggest that the Sm.LTA interacts with TLR2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.
TI  - Microbiological findings of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare vaginal culture results between prepubertal girls with and  without vulvovaginitis, and obtain an overview of the most commonly encountered microbes. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos during September 2011-December 2012. PATIENTS: 115 prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms and additionally 20 age-matched asymptomatic girls. METHODS: Each girl had a vaginal smear carried out using a sterile swab from the introitus or lower third of the vagina. All samples were referred to the microbiology laboratory where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. RESULTS: Positive microbiological findings were seen in all 115 (100%) symptomatic girls and in 12 (60%) control group girls (p<0.001). Pathogenic bacteria were found only in symptomatic girls. Statistically significant differences in bacteria culture results (pure or mixed) and growth of isolated bacteria colonies between patients versus healthy girls were found (p<0.05). The dominant bacteria in the target group, accounting for 66% of all isolated microbes, were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus and A group Streptococcus beta haemolyticus. The bacteria of faecal origin were isolated from 61 (53%) girls with vulvovaginitis and from 5 (25%) girls without vaginal inflammation (p<0.05). Instances of Candida species were extremely rare (2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Positive microbiological findings, mixed bacteria cultures and a high growth of bacteria colonies are found significantly more often in girls with vulvovaginitis. The main causative premenarchal vulvovaginitis agents are faecal in origin.
TI  - Inducing secondary metabolite production by the endophytic fungus Fusarium tricinctum through coculture with Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Coculturing the fungal endophyte Fusarium tricinctum with the bacterium Bacillus  subtilis 168 trpC2 on solid rice medium resulted in an up to 78-fold increase in the accumulation in constitutively present secondary metabolites that included lateropyrone (5), cyclic depsipeptides of the enniatin type (6-8), and the lipopeptide fusaristatin A (9). In addition, four compounds (1-4) including (-)-citreoisocoumarin (2) as well as three new natural products (1, 3, and 4) were not present in discrete fungal and bacterial controls and only detected in the cocultures. The new compounds were identified as macrocarpon C (1), 2-(carboxymethylamino)benzoic acid (3), and (-)-citreoisocoumarinol (4) by analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS data. Enniatins B1 (7) and A1 (8), whose production was particularly enhanced, inhibited the growth of the cocultivated B. subtilis strain with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 16 and 8 mug/mL, respectively, and were also active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis with MIC values in the range 2-8 mug/mL. In addition, lateropyrone (5), which was constitutively present in F. tricinctum, displayed good antibacterial activity against B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis, with MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 mug/mL. All active compounds were equally effective against a multiresistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and a susceptible reference strain of the same species.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the minimum bactericidal concentrations of different root-end filling materials.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of root-end filling materials ProRoot MTA, MTA Angelus and IRM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Macrodilution broth method was used. Microorganisms used were: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Streptococcus mutans. Serial two-fold dilutions of root-end filling samples were prepared in macrodilution tubes with concentrations ranging from 1/2 to 1/512. The samples dilutions were incubated for 24 hours. After incubation, 0.1 ml of diluted culture was inoculated onto the surface of supplemented sheep blood agar (Merck, Germany) and all plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in aerobic condition for 24 hours. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of root-end filling samples where no growth was recorded. RESULTS: MBC of both mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) products against S. aureus were recorded as 15.62 mg/ml and for IRM 31.25 mg/ml MBC for both MTA groups against E. faecalis were recorded as 31.25 mg/ml and for IRM 62.5 mg/ml. MBC of all root-end filling samples against S. mutans were recorded as 62.5 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: All tested root-end filling materials showed acceptable MBC against S. aureus and E. faecalis. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: All tested materials can be used safely for filling of a root-end cavity.
TI  - Photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based TiO2 nanocomposites after cessation of UV irradiation.
AB  - Photocatalysis induced by TiO2 and UV light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. The present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of UV irradiation. We show that resin-based composites containing 20% TiO2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post UV. For biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct UV illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - ICESluvan, a 94-kilobase mosaic integrative conjugative element conferring interspecies transfer of VanB-type glycopeptide resistance, a novel bacitracin resistance locus, and a toxin-antitoxin stabilization system.
AB  - A 94-kb integrative conjugative element (ICESluvan) transferable to Enterococcus  faecium and Enterococcus faecalis from an animal isolate of Streptococcus lutetiensis consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different Gram-positive bacteria. A variant of ICESluvan was confirmed in S. lutetiensis from a patient. A complete Tn5382/Tn1549 with a vanB2 operon is integrated into a streptococcal ICESde3396-like region harboring a putative bacteriophage exclusion system, a putative agglutinin receptor precursor, and key components of a type IV secretion system. Moreover, ICESluvan encodes a putative MobC family mobilization protein and a relaxase and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for conjugative transfer. A 9-kb element within Tn5382/Tn1549 encodes, among others, putative proteins similar to the TnpX site-specific recombinase in Faecalibacterium and VanZ in Paenibacillus, which may contribute to the detected low-level teicoplanin resistance. Furthermore, ICESluvan encodes a novel bacitracin resistance locus that is associated with reduced susceptibility to bacitracin when transferred to E. faecium. The expression of a streptococcal pezAT toxin-antitoxin-encoding operon of ICESluvan in S. lutetiensis, E. faecium, and E. faecalis was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, indicating an active toxin-antitoxin system which may contribute to stabilizing ICESluvan within new hosts. Junction PCR and DNA sequencing confirmed that ICESluvan excised to form a circular intermediate in S. lutetiensis, E. faecalis, and E. faecium. Transfer between E. faecalis cells was observed in the presence of helper plasmid pIP964. Sequence analysis of the original S. lutetiensis donor and enterococcal transconjugants showed that ICESluvan integrates in a site-specific manner into the C-terminal end of the chromosomal tRNA methyltransferase gene rumA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - First isolation of oleate-dependent Enterococcus faecalis small-colony variants from the umbilical exudate of a paediatric patient with omphalitis.
AB  - An oleate-dependent Enterococcus faecalis isolate representing small-colony variants (SCVs) was isolated from the umbilical exudate of a 31-month-old Japanese male patient in Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan. The patient had been suffering from recurrent omphalitis since early infancy. The initial E. faecalis SCV isolate formed small colonies on sheep blood agar plates and tiny colonies on chocolate and modified Drigalski agar, although no visible growth was observed in HK-semi solid medium after 48 h incubation in ambient air. Moreover, the SCV isolate, the colonial morphology of which was reminiscent of Streptococcus species, could not be identified using the MicroScan WalkAway-40 and API 20 Strep systems, both of which yielded profile numbers that did not correspond to any bacterial species, probably as a result of insufficient growth of the isolate. The SCV isolate was subsequently identified as E. faecalis based on its morphological, cultural and biochemical properties, and this was confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene of the organism. Investigations revealed that the addition of oleate, an unsaturated fatty acid, enabled the isolate to grow on every medium with normal-sized colony morphology. Although it has long been known that long-chain fatty acids, especially unsaturated oleic acid, have a major inhibitory effect on the growth of a variety of microorganisms, including not only mycobacteria but also streptococci, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinical isolation of an oleate-dependent E. faecalis SCV isolate. In addition, oleic acid might be considered to affect the cell membrane permeability of carbohydrates or antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams.
TI  - Comparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.
AB  - This study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl),  chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), Listerine(R), and high purity chlorine dioxide (Solumium, ClO2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. Antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the gold standard phenol. We investigated Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Veillonella alcalescens, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. Furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. Massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: CHX, Listerine(R) or hyper pure ClO2. Their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. The results have showed that hyper pure ClO2 solution is more effective than other currently used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and Candida yeast. In case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to CHX solution. The biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure ClO2 is significantly stronger compared to CHX and Listerine(R) after 5 min treatment. In conclusion, hyper pure ClO2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity ClO2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and in dental or oral surgery practice.
TI  - Microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
AB  - The present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. The product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). These molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). The structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and three Gram-negative bacteria viz., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) cell line. In general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. The coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (R = i-Pr, R(1) = 6-Cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/mL.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial potential of 10% ginger extract against Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Enterococcus faecalis: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Enterococcus faecalis are the three oral microorganisms most commonly implicated in the causation of oral infections. All these oral microorganisms have shown resistant to routinely used antimicrobials. There is a need for an antimicrobial agent which is effective, safe, and economical. Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger is one such plant product which has been used from ancient time. It has been shown to possess promising inhibitory effect on many of the oral microorganisms. On review of dental literature, there was scarcity of studies which had tried to assess antimicrobial potential of ginger extract against S. mutans, E. faecalis, and C. albicans; hence, the present study was designed. AIM: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial potential of 10% ginger extract against S. mutans, E. faecalis, and C. albicans. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Laboratory setting and experimental design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first part of the study, 10% ethanolic ginger extract was prepared in the laboratory of Pharmacy College. It was then subjected to microbiological assay to determine its zone of inhibition using Agar disk diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using serial broth dilution method against S. mutans, C. albicans, and E. faecalis. RESULTS: 10% ethanolic ginger extract showed: (a) Maximum zone of inhibition of 8 mm, 14 mm, and 11 mm against S. mutans, C. albicans, and E. faecalis respectively. (b) MIC of 1.25%, 2.5%, and 2.5% against S. mutans, C. albicans, and E. faecalis respectively. CONCLUSION: 10% ethanolic ginger extract was found to possess antimicrobial potential against all the three pathogens used in the study.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of novel organocobaloximes as potential catecholase and antimicrobial activity agents.
AB  - An asymmetric, potentially bidentate dioxime ligand (H(2)L) was formed by condensation of 4-biphenylchloroglyoxime and napthyl-1-amine. Two equivalents of H(2)L were reacted with CoCl(2) . 6H(2)O under appropriate conditions with deprotonation of the dioxime ligand. A series of new organocobaloxime derivatives of the type [CoR(HL)(2)Py], [CoRL(2)PyB(2)F(4)], and [CoRL(2)Py(Cu(phen))(2)] (H(2)L = 4-(napthyl-1-amino)biphenylglyoxime; phen = 1,10-phenathroline; R = izopropyl and benzyl; Py = pyridine) were synthesized. The products were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Catecholase-like activity properties of all complexes were also studied. All complexes are catalysts for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone in methanol. Antimicrobial activity studies of H(2)L and the six complexes were carried out on standard strains (human pathogenic) of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudominas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi) and the yeast Candida albicans. The compounds showed a significant inhibition of the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria tested. Among the tested microorganisms, S. aureus was the most sensitive strain, especially to H(2)L and its complexes.
TI  - Functional diversity of tandem substrate-binding domains in ABC transporters from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter GlnPQ is an essential uptake system for amino acids in gram-positive pathogens and related nonpathogenic bacteria. The transporter has tandem substrate-binding domains (SBDs) fused to each transmembrane domain, giving rise to four SBDs per functional transporter complex. We have determined the crystal structures and ligand-binding properties of the SBDs of GlnPQ from Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Lactococcus lactis. The tandem SBDs differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single ABC transporter. The combined structural, functional, and thermodynamic analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity. We succeeded in converting a low-affinity SBD into a high-affinity receptor and vice versa. Our data indicate that a small number of residues that reside in the binding pocket constitute the major affinity determinants of the SBDs.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of Serbia and lowland regions of Croatia.
AB  - The goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (BG) and nine fresh soft (ZG) artisanal cheeses collected in Serbia and Croatia. While LAB were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all BG cheeses but only in three ZG cheese samples. High LAB and yeast species diversity was determined (average H'(L)=0.4 and H'(Y)=0.8, respectively). The predominant LAB species in white pickled (BG) cheeses were Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (ZG) cheeses the most dominant LAB species were L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Among the 20 yeast species found, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida zeylanoides, and Torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in BG cheeses, while Yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in ZG cheeses. The characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of LAB isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of LAB strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic or proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of LAB and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. The knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific LAB and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.
TI  - TUNEL analysis of DNA fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during IVF cycles.
AB  - Recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. Previous studies have reported that DNA fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. This study examined the DNA within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was used to label DNA fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. The bacteria Streptococcus anginosus and Peptoniphilus spp., Lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), L. gasseri (high-dose), Enterococcus faecalis, or Propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. The most severe DNA fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing P. acnes or L. gasseri (high-dose). No DNA fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose L. gasseri or E. faecalis. Low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). Bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause DNA fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. Follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor IVF outcomes.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase (PYK) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. Lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of PYK in their metabolism. These organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. They include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of PYK by inorganic phosphate, the activation of PYK shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. System-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. These require knowledge of the identities of the enzyme modifiers. Here, we predict potential allosteric activators of PYKs from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. We used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of PYK. Specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. We then made a kinetic model of Lactococcus lactis PYK to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. This strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the Enterococcus faecalis PYK, and to predict that the PYKs from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. These differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. The combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.
TI  - Direction of aminoacylated transfer RNAs into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer RNAs often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. Many clinically relevant bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-tRNA species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. Subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. In Streptomycetes, aminoacylated-tRNA species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. The direction of coding aminoacylated-tRNA molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.
TI  - Kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from Streptococcus pyogenes M49.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. S. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ADS) for survival in acidic environments. In this study, the arginine deiminase (AD), and carbamate kinase (CK) from S. pyogenes M49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. AD and CK from S. pyogenes M49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and Enterococcus faecalis V583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). We found that the arginine deiminase of S. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., ATP, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). The Km and Vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mM (mean+/-SD) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. The carbamate kinase is inhibited by ATP but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. The Km and Vmax values for ADP were 0.72+/-0.08mM and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the Km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mM. The optimum pH and temperature for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively.
TI  - Association of bacteria with marine invertebrates: implications for ballast water management.
AB  - Bacteria associated with plankton are of importance in marine bioinvasions and the implementation of ship's ballast water treatment technologies. In this study, epibiotic and endobiotic bacteria associated with zooplankton, including barnacle nauplii, veliger larvae, and adults of the copepod Oithona sp., were characterized and quantified. Barnacle nauplius and veliger larva harbored ~4.4 x 10(5)cells ind(-1) whereas Oithona sp. had 8.8 x 10(5)cells ind(-1). Computation of bacterial contribution based on biovolume indicated that despite being the smallest zooplankton tested, veliger larvae harbored the highest number of bacteria, while barnacle nauplii, the largest of the zooplankton, tested in terms of volume contributed the least. Pulverization of zooplankton led to an increase in bacterial numbers; for example, Vibrio cholerae, which was initially 3.5 x 10(3), increased to 5.4 x 10(5)CFU g(-1); Escherichia coli increased from 5.0 x 10(2) to 1.3 x 10(4)CFU g(-1); and Streptococcus faecalis increased from 2.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(5)CFU g(-1), respectively. Pulverized zooplankton was aged in the dark to assess the contribution of bacteria from decaying debris. Aging of pulverized zooplankton led to emergence of Chromobacterium violaceum, which is an opportunistic pathogen in animals and humans.
TI  - Bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. Although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via Toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. There is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. However, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. There are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, Escherichia coli plus Enterococcus faecalis in ProSymbioflor and heat-killed Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not be reduced by these interventions. SUMMARY: During the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. There was only an effect on eczema in the ProSymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using B. breve and S. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. However, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  - Lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. Lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific Gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. The potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. Through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. Furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. Clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of lysins in humans.
TI  - Performance of the Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry system for identification of Gram-positive cocci routinely isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  - We evaluated the performance of the Vitek MS for identification of Gram-positive  cocci routinely isolated in clinical microbiology laboratories. With a total of 424 well-characterized isolates, the results of the Vitek MS were compared to those of conventional methods and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The Vitek MS correctly identified 97.9 % of the isolates tested to species level. The Vitek MS correctly identified the species of 97.2 % of the staphylococci (95.9 % of coagulase-negative staphylococci), 97.8 % of the streptococci, and 100 % of the enterococci. For the identification of Gram-positive cocci isolates, the overall concordance rate between conventional identification and the Vitek MS was 94.5 %. The Vitek MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system can be a reliable and rapid method for the identification of most relevant Gram-positive cocci. In addition, expanding the database of the Vitek MS, especially for coagulase-negative staphylococci, is needed to enhance the performance of the Vitek MS.
TI  - Regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) display differences in their regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. We combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), phosphate (Pi), and ionic strength (NaCl concentration) on six LDHs from four LABs studied at pH 6 and pH 7. We found that 1) the extent of activation by FBP (Kact) differs. Lactobacillus plantarum LDH is not regulated by FBP, but the other LDHs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: Enterococcus faecalis LDH2 </= Lactococcus lactis LDH2 < E. faecalis LDH1 < L. lactis LDH1 </= Streptococcus pyogenes LDH. This trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the LDH enzymes. 2) For L. plantarum, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis, the effects of Pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding NaCl. 3) Addition of Pi inhibits E. faecalis LDH2, whereas in the absence of FBP, Pi is an activator of S. pyogenes LDH, E. faecalis LDH1, and L. lactis LDH1 and LDH2 at pH 6. These effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of Pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to pH 6 and pH 7. Overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of Pi, FBP, and pH that results in different regulatory effects on the LDHs of different LABs.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. This study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with CP. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with CP in the United States. The samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/L, clindamycin at 4 mg/L, doxycycline at 4 mg/L, and metronidazole at 16 mg/L, with a post hoc combination of data for amoxicillin and metronidazole. Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the patients with CP revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. One or more test species, most often Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with CP, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either S. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP in the United States frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. The wide variability found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with CP.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. In this study, we examine susceptibility among Gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. A total of 9,422 Gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from Europe and North America. One-third of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. All S. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). Ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (P < 0.0001 for both). Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in Africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in Asia-Pacific Rim (38%). Penicillin resistance occurred in one-fifth of all S. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in Africa to 65% in Europe. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P < 0.001). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in TEST 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.
TI  - Volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  - Ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Antibacterial serrulatane diterpenes from the Australian native plant Eremophila  microtheca.
AB  - Chemical investigations of the aerial parts of the Australian plant Eremophila microtheca resulted in the isolation of three serrulatane diterpenoids, 3-acetoxy-7,8-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (1), 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (2) and 3,19-diacetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-ene (3) as well as the previously reported compounds verbascoside (4) and jaceosidin (5). Acetylation and methylation of the major serrulatane diterpenoid 2 afforded 3,8-diacetoxy-7-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (6) and 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid methyl ester (7), respectively. The antibacterial activity of 1-7 was assessed against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates. All of the serrulatane compounds exhibited moderate activity against Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 12344) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 64-128 mug/mL. Serrulatane 1 demonstrated activity against all Gram-positive bacterial strains (MICs 64-128 mug/mL) except for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. This is the first report of natural products from E. microtheca.
TI  - Evaluation of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. The detection of resistance genes (mecA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and vanA or vanB in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) by the BC-GP assay also was assessed. A total of 186 positive blood cultures (in BacT/Alert FA bottles) with Gram-positive cocci observed with Gram staining were analyzed using the BC-GP assay. The BC-GP results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. Discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat BC-GP testing. The initial BC-GP organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. Only 40% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. The detection of the mecA gene for 69 blood cultures with only S. aureus or S. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. For 3 of 6 cultures with multiple Staphylococcus spp., mecA detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than S. aureus or S. epidermidis. The detection of vanA agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with E. faecalis or E. faecium. Comparison of the mean times to results for each organism group showed that BC-GP results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and antibacterial activity of demethylvancomycin analogues against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Five novel N-substituted demethylvancomycin derivatives were rationally designed  and synthesized by using a structure-based approach. The in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (GRE), methicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MRS), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) were evaluated. One of the compounds, N-(6-phenylheptyl)demethylvancomycin (12 a), was found to exhibit more potent antibacterial activity than vancomycin and demethylvancomycin. Compound 12 a was also found to be ~18-fold more efficacious than vancomycin against MRSA; however, the two compounds were found to have similar efficacy against MRS. Furthermore, compound 12 a exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a half-life of 5.11+/-0.52 h, which is longer than that of vancomycin (4.3+/-1.9 h). These results suggest that 12 a is a promising antibacterial drug candidate for further preclinical evaluation.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a PCR-based rapid screening method.
AB  - Enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. Their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. Conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. This work reports the development of a PCR-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16S rRNA sequence. Published 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (EntF and EntR). The primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11 different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Listeria) or species of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The PCR positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by API 20 Strep panels and sequencing. When dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 Enterococcus strains (15 E. faecalis, 13 E. faecium, and one E. gallinarum) were identified. When susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). None was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. Most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. The molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species.
TI  - The undefined role of Gram positive bacteria in chronic prostatitis development.
AB  
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - Diversity of Streptococcus mutans strains in bacterial interspecies interactions.
AB  - Biofilms are matrix-enclosed microbial population adhere to each other and to surfaces. Compared to planktonic bacterial cells, biofilm cells show much higher levels of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to investigate Streptococcus mutans strain diversity in biofilm formation and chlorhexidine (CHX) resistance of single S. mutans and dual S. mutans-Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Four clinical S. mutans strains (C180-2, C67-1, HG723 and UA159) formed 24-h biofilms with or without an E. faecalis strain. These biofilms were treated for 10 min with 0.025% CHX. Biofilm formation, CHX resistance and S.mutans-E. faecalis interactions were evaluated by biomass staining, resazurin metabolism, viable count and competition agar assays. The main finding is that the presence of E. faecalis generally reduced all dual-species biofilm formation, but the proportions of S. mutans in the dual-species biofilms as well as CHX resistance displayed a clear S. mutans strain dependence. In particular, decreased resistance against CHX was observed in dual S. mutans C67-1 biofilms, while increased resistance was found in dual S. mutans UA159 biofilms. In conclusion, the interaction of S. mutans with E. faecalis in biofilms varies between strains, which underlines the importance of studying strain diversity in inter-species virulence modulation and biofilm antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Topical linezolid 0.2% for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant or vancomycin-intolerant gram-positive bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the successful use of topical linezolid 0.2% in the treatment  of gram-positive bacterial keratitis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series. METHODS: All cases of bacterial keratitis treated at the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary with topical linezolid were identified from the Cornea and External Disease Clinic and were reviewed for culture results, prior therapy, clinical course, and visual outcome. RESULTS: Three patients received topical linezolid, all for cases of culture-positive or presumed gram-positive keratitis. Cases consisted of 1 patient with recalcitrant vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and 2 patients with infectious crystalline keratitis, 1 previously culture-positive for an uncharacterized Staphylococcus and the other for Streptococcus mitis. All 3 patients had rapid resolution of their infectious keratitis and noted no pain or discomfort attributed to the topical therapy. The patient with VRE keratitis developed a consecutive Candida keratitis elsewhere in the same cornea at the end of therapy for her VRE keratitis. CONCLUSION: Topical linezolid 0.2% can be an effective ophthalmic antibiotic for the treatment of gram-positive keratitis, including VRE, and is both significantly more comfortable and less immediately toxic to the ocular surface than topical vancomycin.
TI  - Engineering of a functional thermostable kanamycin resistance marker for use in Moorella thermoacetica ATCC39073.
AB  - A transformation system for Moorella thermoacetica ATCC39073 was developed using  thermostable kanamycin resistant gene (kanR) derived from the plasmid pJH1 that Streptococcus faecalis harbored. When kanR with its native promoter was introduced into uracil auxotrophic mutant of M. thermoacetica ATCC39073 together with a gene to complement the uracil auxotrophy as a selection marker, it did not give kanamycin resistance due to poor transcription level of kanR. However, the use of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter cloned from M. thermoacetica ATCC39073 significantly improved transcription level of kanR and resulted in the cell growth in the presence of more than 150 mug mL(-1) kanamycin. It was also demonstrated that kanR with G3PD promoter can be used as a selection marker for transformation of wild-type strain of M. thermoacetica ATCC39073.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma against microorganisms isolated from oral cavity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autologous platelet concentrates (PCs) have been extensively used in  a variety of medical fields to promote soft and hard tissue regeneration. The significance behind their use lies in the abundance of growth factors in platelets alpha-granules that promotes wound healing. In addition, antibacterial properties of PCs against various bacteria have been recently pointed out. In this study, the antimicrobial effect of pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) was evaluated against oral cavity microorganisms such as Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus oralis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Blood samples were obtained from 17 patients who underwent oral surgery procedures involving the use of P-PRP. The antibacterial activity of P-PRP, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), was determined through the microdilution twofold serial method. RESULTS: P-PRP inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus oralis, but not of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. CONCLUSIONS: P-PRP is a potentially useful substance in the fight against postoperative infections. This might represent a valuable property in adjunct to the enhancement of tissue regeneration.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Assessment of a semi-automated protocol for multiplex analysis of sepsis-causing  bacteria with spiked whole blood samples.
AB  - Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. Recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. In this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. We spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial DNA with the NorDiag Arrow device, using the SelectNA Blood pathogen DNA isolation kit. DNA extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and microarray-based Prove-it Bone and Joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/mL (CFU/mL). To understand the recovery losses of bacterial DNA during the sample preparation step and the capability of the PCR- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the PCR and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. In addition, the inclusivity of the Prove-it Bone and Joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones carrying SCCmec types I, II, IV, or V and a nontypable SCCmec type. The proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial DNA extraction method combined with the high-throughput PCR- and microarray-based platform. Further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.
TI  - Biological approach to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles using Aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - Nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. A novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) was reported. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, XRD, AFM and FESEM with EDX. FTIR showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group OH stretching amine NH stretch in the formation of TiO2 NPs. The XRD spectrum confirmed that the synthesized TiO2 NPs were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. The crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. The morphological characterization was analyzed by FESEM and the analysis showed the NPs smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. GC-MS analysis showed the main compounds found in A. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-L-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-L-proline (74.41%) and L-Leucyl-D-leucine (15.74%). The potential glycyl-L-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. A possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of TiO2 NPs has been proposed. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized TiO2 NPs was assessed by well diffusion method toward A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against S. aureus (33 mm) and S. pyogenes (31 mm).
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial flora during the ripening of Kedong sufu, a typical Chinese traditional bacteria-fermented soybean product.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kedong sufu is a typical bacteria-fermented sufu in China. Isolation  and identification of the autochthonous bacteria involved would allow the design of specific starters for this speciality. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the bacterial flora during the ripening of Kedong sufu using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and culturing. RESULTS: In terms of bacterial diversity, 22 strains were isolated and identified and 27 strains were detected by DGGE. Regarding bacterial dynamics, the results of culturing and PCR-DGGE exhibited a similar trend towards dominant strains. Throughout the fermentation of sufu, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus carnosus were the dominant microflora, while the secondary microflora comprised Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus lutetiensis, Kocuria rosea, Kocuria kristinae, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to reveal the bacterial flora during the ripening of Kedong sufu using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This information will help in the design of autochthonous starter cultures for the production of Kedong sufu with desirable characteristic sensory profiles and shorter ripening times.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the biological and physical properties of Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage vB_EfaS_GEC-EfS_3 and Streptococcus mitis bacteriophage vB_SmM_GEC-SmitisM_2.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mitis are common commensal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. However, both species can be opportunistic pathogens and cause disease in nosocomial settings. These infections can be difficult to treat because of the frequency of antibiotic resistance among these strains. Bacteriophages are often suggested as an alternative therapeutic agent against these infections. In this study, E. faecalis and S. mitis strains were isolated from female patients with urinary tract infections. Bacteriophages active against these strains were isolated from sewage water from the Mtkvari River. Two phages, designated vB_EfaS_GEC-EfS_3 (Syphoviridae) and vB_SmM_GEC-SmitisM_2 (Myoviridae), were specific for E. faecalis and S. mitis, respectively. Each phage's growth patterns and adsorption rates were quantified. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light and temperature was determined, as was host range and serology. The S. mitis bacteriophage was found to be more resistant to ultraviolet light and exposure to high temperatures than the E. faecalis bacteriophage, despite having a much greater rate of replication. While each phage was able to infect a broad range of strains of the same species as the host species from which they were isolated, they were unable to infect other host species tested.
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Verigene(R) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. A key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. However, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. During the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of BSIs and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. This review focuses on the properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the Verigene((R)) Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria associated with BSIs, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp., and Enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (mecA, vanA, and vanB). Based on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between BC-GP test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree of agreement for identification of mecA-mediated meticillin resistance in S. aureus and S. epidermidis organisms and vanA- or vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium organisms.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees C and -20 degrees C on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen (N) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. Bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen. An effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the South African National Milk Recording Scheme (NMRS) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/mL milk. The organisation responsible for sample collection of the NMRS milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. This existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.Ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. An additional sampling was performed at week 30 for samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees C. Freezing and cryopreservation did not impair subsequent isolation of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus (STH) (phage type lytic group III) or Sta. aureus (STA) (phage typed, other than lytic group III). Survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. The survival of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and Escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. Coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.Both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in South African dairy herds.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. This study examined its in vitro activity against relevant Gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 40 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 45 Enterococcus faecalis, 60 Enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 Streptococcus pneumoniae. Except with VanA enterococci, telavancin MICs were tightly clustered and unimodal. Telavancin MICs for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/L to 0.5mg/L, with no shift for MRSA or MSSA in relation to vancomycin MIC. Nevertheless, and independently of species, CoNS with raised vancomycin MICs had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. Modal telavancin MICs were 0.5mg/L and </=0.03 mg/L for glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, with no rise for VanB isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/L and 1-4 mg/L for VanA isolates, respectively. Streptococci were consistently susceptible, with MICs of </=0.06 mg/L. Telavancin MICs by Etest agreed within 1 doubling dilution with those found previously by BSAC agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. In the few cases (13/345) where telavancin MICs by Etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those by agar dilution, the Etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. Telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with VanA, with no erosion of this activity against MRSA with raised vancomycin MICs. MICs by Etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by BSAC agar dilution.
TI  - Circulating microRNA signatures in mice exposed to lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, we had identified a specific whole blood-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) signature in mice following in vivo injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) originated from Gram-negative bacteria. This study was designed to profile the circulating miRNAs expression in mice exposed to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) which is a major component of the wall of Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of 100 mug of LTA originated from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were killed 6 h and the whole blood samples were obtained for miRNA expression analysis using a miRNA array (Phalanx miRNA OneArray(R) 1.0). Up-regulated expression of miRNA targets in the whole blood, serum and white blood cells (WBCs) of C57BL/6 and Tlr2-/- mice upon LTA treatment in 10, 100, or 1000 ug concentrations was quantified at indicated time (2, 6, 24, and 72 h) using real-time RT-PCR and compared with that in the serum of C57BL/6 mice injected with 100 ug of LPS. A significant increase of 4 miRNAs (miR-451, miR-668, miR-1902, and miR-1904) was observed in the whole blood and the serum in a dose- and time-dependent fashion following LTA injection. Induction of miRNA occurred in the serum after 2 h and persisted for at least 6 h. No increased expression of these 4 miRNAs was found in the WBCs. Higher but not significant expression level of these 4 miRNAs were observed following LTA treatment in the serum of Tlr2-/-against that of C57BL6 mice. In contrast, LPS exposure induced moderate expression of miR-451 but not of the other 3 miRNA targets. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a specific circulating miRNA signature in mice exposed to LTA. That expression profile is different from those of mice exposed to LPS. Those circulating miRNAs induced by LTA or LPS treatment may serve as promising biomarkers for the differentiation between exposures to Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes of tridentate asymmetrical Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, properties and biological activity.
AB  - New asymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands were synthesized using 1,2-phenylenediamine, 4-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde, 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were synthesised and characterized by using FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-Vis, XRD, ESR, elemental analysis and fluorescence studies. The antimicrobial activity of the ligands and their metal complexes were studied against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus mutans RSHM 676, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The determination of the antibacterial activity was done using the broth microdilution methods. In general, it has been determined that the studied compounds have MIC values similar to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been found that Ni, Pb, Zn derivatives of HL1A and ZnL(2)A has lower MIC values than ampicillin for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strain.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium isolated from Lombo, a Portuguese traditional meat product:  characterisation of antibacterial compounds and factors affecting bacteriocin production.
AB  - Strain ST211CH, identified as a strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from Lombo produced a bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of Enterococcus spp., Listeria spp., Klebsiella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. The mode of action of the bacteriocin named as bacteriocin ST211Ch was bactericidal against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19443. As determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE, the approximate molecular mass of the bacteriocin was 8.0 kDa. Loss in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Maximum activity of bacteriocin ST211Ch was measured in broth cultures of E. faecium strain ST211Ch after 24 h; thereafter, the activity was reduced. Bacteriocin ST211Ch remained active after exposure to various temperatures and pHs, as well as to Triton X-100, Tween-80, Tween-20, sodium dodecyl sulfate, NaCl, urea and EDTA. Effect of media components on production of bacteriocin ST211Ch was also studied. On the basis of PCR reactions targeting different bacteriocin genes, i.e. enterocins, curvacins and sakacins, no evidences for the presence of these genes in the total DNA of E. faecium strain ST211Ch was obtained. The bacterium most probably produced a bacteriocin different from those mentioned above. Based on the antimicrobial spectrum, stability and mode of action of bacteriocin ST211CH, E. faecium strain ST211Ch might be considered as a potential candidate with beneficial properties for use in biopreservation to control food spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Streptococcus gordonii collagen-binding domain protein CbdA may enhance bacterial survival in instrumented root canals ex vivo.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The surface-associated collagen-binding protein Ace of Enterococcus faecalis has been implicated as a virulence factor that contributes to bacterial persistence in endodontic infections. The purpose of this study was to determine if proteins with amino acid sequence similarity to Ace found in more abundant oral streptococci could play a similar role in potentially enhancing endodontic infections. METHODS: A Streptococcus gordonii gene similar to ace was identified by genome sequence searches in silico. An isogenic derivative of strain DL1 with a disruption in the identified gene was constructed by allelic replacement. Parent and mutant strains were characterized for their ability to bind immobilized collagen type 1 in a microtiter plate-binding assay. Survival of the strains in a human tooth ex vivo-instrumented root canal model was compared by inoculating canals with parental or mutant bacteria and determining the colony-forming units (CFUs) recovered at various time points over a 12-day period. RESULTS: The S. gordonii gene, encoding a protein with a conserved collagen-binding domain similar to that of Ace, was designated cbdA. The cbdA-deficient cells were less able to bind collagen type 1 than parental cells (P < .0001). Genetic complementation of the cbdA-deficient strain restored the collagen-binding phenotype. By day 12, significantly fewer (P = .03) cbdA-deficient than parental CFUs were recovered from instrumented canals. CONCLUSIONS: A gene encoding a putative collagen-binding protein was identified in S. gordonii. Fewer S. gordonii cbdA-deficient cells survived ex vivo compared with parental cells, suggesting that collagen-binding proteins may contribute to the persistence of oral streptococci in instrumented root canals.
TI  - Bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy Ethiopian infants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from faecal samples of healthy Ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. One hundred fifty LAB were obtained from 28 healthy Ethiopian infants. The isolates belonged to Lactobacillus (81/150), Enterococcus (54/150) and Streptococcus (15/150) genera. Lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while Enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. Bacteriocin-producing LAB species were isolated from eight of the infants. Many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from Streptococcus salivarius, avicin A (class IIa) from Enterococcus avium, one class IIa bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from E. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from Lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri isolate. Susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. The streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. All enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. Only one E. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. Tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to E. faecalis (47 %) and Enterococcus faecium (33 %). Screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. The structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being E. faecalis and Enterococcus raffinosus. This study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal LAB of Ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy using visible light plus water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA).
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) using visible light together with water-filtered infrared-A (VIS+wIRA) to eradicate single species of planktonic bacteria and micro-organisms during initial oral bacterial colonization in situ. A broadband VIS+wIRA radiator with a water-filtered spectrum in the range 580-1400 nm was used for irradiation. Toluidine blue (TB) was utilized as a photosensitizer at concentrations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 microg ml(-1). The unweighted (absolute) irradiance was 200 mW cm(-2) and it was applied for 1 min. Planktonic cultures of Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis were treated with APDT. Salivary bacteria harvested by centrifugation of native human saliva were also tested. In addition, initial bacterial colonization of bovine enamel slabs carried in the mouths of six healthy volunteers was treated in the same way. Up to 2 log(10) of S. mutans and E. faecalis were killed by APDT. Salivary bacteria were eliminated to a higher extent of 3.7-5 log(10). All TB concentrations tested proved to be highly effective. The killing rate of bacteria in the initial oral bacterial colonization was significant (P=0.004) at all tested TB concentrations, despite the interindividual variations found among study participants. This study has shown that APDT in combination with TB and VIS+wIRA is a promising method for killing bacteria during initial oral colonization. Taking the healing effects of wIRA on human tissue into consideration, this technique could be helpful in the treatment of peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
TI  - Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. E. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated UTI, however, little is known about how recurrent UTIs and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of UTIs. This study aimed to establish the aetiology of UTI in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. The aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with UTI (defined as >/= 104 CFU/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. METHODS: Urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on Flexicult agar(R) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. Patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of UTI, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to UTI. All tentative E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were identified to species level by PCR, 16S rRNA and partial sequencing of the groEL gene. E. faecalis isolates were further characterized by Multi Locus Sequence Typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. On average, patients reported to have suffered from UTI for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 UTIs during the previous year). Cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of UTI at the hospital. E. faecalis (55.1%), E. coli (12.2%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. MIC testing of E. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). MLST revealed 12 Sequence Types (ST) of which ST 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The different aetiology of UTI compared with reports elsewhere, where E. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent UTIs together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. The similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated ST 16 isolates in Vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that E. faecalis ST 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. Treatment of UTI with cephalosporins may select for E. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of E. faecalis ST 16 in acute UTI.
TI  - ZAAPS Program results for 2010: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 75 medical centres in 24 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for Gram-positive organisms in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific. For the 2010 Program a total of 6305 Gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: Staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (855), enterococci (787), Streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). Linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. Of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (China, Thailand, Germany, and Brazil). Eight CoNS (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 mug/ml). Two strains from Mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from Italy and Brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. MRSA rates varied by region and between nations, as did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for MRSA therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In summary, the 2010 ZAAPS Program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel water-soluble nocathiacin analogs.
AB  - Semi-synthetic water-soluble analogs were synthesized from nocathiacin I through  the formation of a versatile intermediate nocathiacin amine 5, and subsequent transformation via reductive amination, acylation or urea formation. Several of the novel analogs displayed much improved aqueous solubility over 1, while retained antibacterial activity. Compound 15 and 16 from the amide series, demonstrated excellent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity.
TI  - The effects of different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate on the antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium enrich mixture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Calcium Enrich Mixture) CEM (mixed with different concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cements used in this in vitro study included Gray proRoot MTA and CEM with the microorganisms being entrococcus faecalis, streptococcus muntas, Candida albicans, Actinomyces, Escherichia coli, and a mixture of these microorganisms. CHX was used in the form of liquid at 0.2%, 2%, and 0.12% concentrations. Contact dilution and colony count method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of these cements. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hour intervals, we cultured the samples on blood agar medium. Colonies were counted after incubation at 37 degrees . Data were statistically analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the antimicrobial activity of MTA and CEM. RESULTS: All concentrations of CHX were mixed with MTA and the CEM had antibacterial activities on all microorganisms' strains except for the Enterococcus faecalis and the mixture group. MTA had better antibacterial activity than the CEM, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.13). The mixing of MTA and the CEM with CHX significantly increased the antibacterial properties of both cements (P < 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference between the different concentrations of CHX. The antibacterial activity of the materials increased through time. CONCLUSION: The mixture of MTA and CEM with different concentration of CHX significantly increased the antibacterial activity.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial effect of three irrigant solutions (chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidinated MUMS).
AB  - AIM: To compare the antimicrobial effect of 2% chlorhexidine, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and MUMS containing 2% chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All of the above irrigants were examined on Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei and E. coli. A total of 0.5 CC of each solution and 0.5 CC of McFarland solution bacterium were added to each examination tube. After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, colony count was performed for each tube. The difference in the number of bacteria indicated the effect taken by disinfectant material. RESULTS: MUMS containing chlorhexidine showed the antimicrobial properties just like chlorhexidine's effect against E. coli, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei in preventing these entire microorganisms to incubate. Sodium hypochlorite was not effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans incubated in 15, 30 and 45 minutes and Enterococcus faecalis in 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: MUMS has antimicrobial properties similar to chlorhexidine. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: As MUMS containing chlorhexidine can transfer chlorhexidine through its own surfactant around apical area and it can open the dentinal tubules by its own chelator for more penetration of chlorhexidine, it may be a choice for canal irrigation.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem RT-PCR assay.
AB  - The early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. Rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. We evaluated the performance of the Gram Positive 12 multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) assay (AusDiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci including Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, vanA, vanB). A total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating Gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. Amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, MT-PCR identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. MT-PCR identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. Meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by MT-PCR in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and eight E. faecium isolates, respectively. Gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the MT-PCR assay within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - pH and Antimicrobial Activity of Portland Cement Associated with Different Radiopacifying Agents.
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and pH changes induced by Portland cement (PC) alone and in association with radiopacifiers. Methods. The materials tested were pure PC, PC + bismuth oxide, PC + zirconium oxide, PC + calcium tungstate, and zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar diffusion test using the following strains: Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C, inhibition of bacterial growth was observed and measured. For pH analysis, material samples (n = 10) were placed in polyethylene tubes and immersed in 10 mL of distilled water. After 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, the pH of the solutions was determined using a pH meter. Results. All microbial species were inhibited by the cements evaluated. All materials composed of PC with radiopacifying agents promoted pH increase similar to pure Portland cement. ZOE had the lowest pH values throughout all experimental periods. Conclusions. All Portland cement-based materials with the addition of different radiopacifiers (bismuth oxide, calcium tungstate, and zirconium oxide) presented antimicrobial activity and pH similar to pure Portland cement.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Triterpene saponins of Maesa lanceolata stem wood.
AB  - Phytochemical analysis of aqueous MeOH extract of Maesa lanceolata stem wood has  led to the isolation of four new triterpene saponins characterized as 16alpha,21beta-diacetoxy-22alpha-angeloyl-28-hydroxyolean-12-ene 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (1), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta-hydroxy-22alpha-angeloyl-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-alpha-arabinopyranoside (2), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta,22alpha-diangeloyl-13beta,28-epoxyoleanane 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-xylopyranoside (3), and 16alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (4), together with the known compounds beta-acetylamyrin, physcion, emodin, chrysophanol, ursolic acid, 16alpha-hydroxy-12-oleanene 3-O-glucoside, beta-amyrin, sitosterol 3-O-beta-glucoside, stigmasterol, and 3beta,28-dihydroxyolean-12-ene. Their structural elucidation was accomplished by homo- and heteronuclear 2D NMR technique as well as comparison with data from known compounds. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the aqueous MeOH extract was also investigated and zones of inhibition ranging from 32 +/- 1.1 to 14 +/- 0.2 mm were observed. Among the isolates, compound 1 was the most active with an minimum inhibitory concentration value of 25 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of root canal medicaments against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - AIM: To compare the antimicrobial activities of Activ Point (Roeko, Langenau, Germany), Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko, Langenau, Germany), calcium hydroxide, 1% chlorhexidine gel and bioactive glass (S53P4) against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and twenty extracted single-rooted human teeth were used. After removing the crowns, root canals were prepared by using the Protaper rotary system. Following autoclave sterilization, root canals were incubated at 37 degrees C with E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. mutans RSHM 676 for 1 week. The specimens, which were divided into five treatment groups for each microorganism according to the intracanal medicament used, were tested in 10 experimental runs. In each experimental run, 10 roots were included as treatment, one root as positive control and one root as sterility control. Sterile paper points were utilized to take samples from root canals after the incubation of teeth in thioglycollate medium at 37 degrees C for 1 week. Samples taken from teeth by sterile paper points were inoculated onto sheep blood agar, and following an overnight incubation, the colonies grown on sheep blood agar were counted and interpreted as colony-forming units. Results were tested statistically by using Kruskal-Wallis and Conover's nonparametric multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: CHX gel (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001), Activ Point (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002) and Ca(OH)(2) (P = 0.010 and P = 0.005) were significantly more effective against E. faecalis than that of Ca(OH)(2) Plus Point and bioactive glass, respectively. On the other hand, compared with Ca(OH)(2) , CHX gel (P < 0.001), and Activ Point (P < 0.001), bioactive glass (P = 0.014) produced significantly lower colony counts of S. mutans. When compared with the positive control, treatment with Ca(OH)(2) Plus Point (P = 0.085 and P = 0.066) did not produce significantly lower colony counts of E. faecalis and S. mutans, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the medicaments having an antimicrobial effect because of their alkaline pH, the medicaments containing chlorhexidine were effective against both E. faecalis and S. mutans.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - The effect of heat-killed Candida albicans and dentin powder on the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine solution.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to compare the inhibitory effect of heat-killed Candida albicans and dentin powder on the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine (CHX) against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial effect of each group was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition diameter in millimeters after incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hours in a humid atmosphere. Each test was repeated three times. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test. RESULTS: Results indicated that both heat-killed C. albicans and dentin powder decreased the antibacterial activity of CHX against both tested bacteria significantly (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both heat-killed Candida albicans and dentin powder reduced the antibacterial activity of CHX significantly.
TI  - Antifungal activity and composition of essential oils of Conyza canadensis herbs  and roots.
AB  - Essential oils from herbs and roots of Conyza canadensis (horseweed), collected in Hungary, were obtained by hydrodistillation. The chemical compositions of the oils were analysed by combination of GC and GC/MS. The major constituent of the oil obtained from the aerial parts of horseweed was limonene (78%), while the main component of root oil was 2Z,8Z-matricaria ester. The antimicrobial activities of the oils were tested on Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, reference fungal strains, and fungal strains isolated from patients (Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichophyton, Rhodotorula, and Aspergillus) by agar disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. None of the oils showed any activity against the tested bacterial strains, but exhibited moderate-to-strong activity against all fungi with the only exception of A. fumigatus. The highest zone of inhibition was observed in case of Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton interdigitalis.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in Europe: trends from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.
AB  - We investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in Europe. Aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. Trend analyses used generalized linear models. Robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. From 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. In the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% CI 6.9-7.5%). The frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in E. coli and Enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. Bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% CI 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% CI -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% CI 3.0-3.7). Increasing rates of E. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. Our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during EARSS surveillance. Trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. It appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. As a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
TI  - Aerobic vaginitis and mixed infections: comparison of clinical and laboratory findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and mixed infections with AV to achieve efficient diagnosis. METHODS: From April 2008 to August 2009, 657 consecutive outpatients with vaginal symptoms in gynecology clinic in the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University were investigated. Samples were taken for examination of vaginal discharge and fresh wet mount microscopy. AV, bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomonal vaginitis (TV) were diagnosed according to standardized definitions. Sixty patients with single AV were randomly selected over the same period. Each patient accepted moxifloxacin therapy. Two kinds of treatment course (400 mg qd, 6 days or 400 mg qd, 12 days) were given. Clinical features and laboratory test results in the first visit and follow-ups were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULT: Among the 657 cases, AV was found in 23.74 % of the cases (156/657). AV mixed infections were diagnosed in 53.85 % (84/156): the mixed infections included VVC (32/84, 38.10 %), BV (31/84, 36.90 %), and TV (21/84, 25.00 %). Common symptoms of AV were a change in the characteristics of the discharge (44/72, 61.11 %) and increased discharge (30/72, 41.67 %). Vaginal pH was usually higher than 4.5 (63/72, 87.50 %). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated. There is no statistically significant difference between two moxifloxacin treatment groups (p > 0.05). Cure rate was 89.7 % in 6-day group, and 71.4 % in 12-day group. CONCLUSIONS: AV is a common vaginal infection, and it is often mixed with other infections, especially VVC, BV and TV. The symptoms and signs of AV mixed infections are atypical. If a patient has vaginal complaints, it is necessary to determine whether AV or mixed infections are present. Oral moxifloxacin is effective in treating AV, and an appropriate course should be selected taking the severity of AV into consideration.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. In vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. Results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. These results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (CFCS) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. Neutralization of the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. These experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. One of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of culture pH. This observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. Furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. The observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from western European countries in 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western Europe. METHODS: Forty-one centres in Spain (8), Italy (9), Germany (8), France (8) and the UK (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 101 VRE, 193 Streptococcus agalactiae and 191 Streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. These were re-identified and susceptibilities to oritavancin and comparators were determined. RESULTS: Oritavancin was very active against MRSA (MIC(50)/MIC(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/L), MRCoNS (0.06/0.12 mg/L), VRE (0.03/0.06 mg/L), S. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/L). The highest oritavancin MIC observed was 0.25 mg/L (species were S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis). CONCLUSIONS: These data from recently collected Gram-positive bacteria in western Europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant MRSA, MRCoNS and VRE isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.
TI  - Non-tuberculous mycobacteria and their surface lipids efficiently induced IL-17 production in human T cells.
AB  - Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is produced by a subset of CD4(+) T helper (Th) lymphocytes known as Th17 cells. In humans, IL-1beta, enhanced by IL-6 and IL-23 is crucial for differentiation of these cells. IL-17 evokes inflammation and is involved in host defence against microorganisms, although little is known about its role in diseases caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The genus Mycobacterium contains both obligate and opportunistic pathogens as well as saprophytes, and the mycobacterial cell envelope is unique in its abundance of lipids. Here we investigated IL-17 and IL-23 production in human PBMC in response to intact UV-inactivated mycobacteria and mycobacterial surface lipids from two opportunistic (Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus) and one generally non-pathogenic (Mycobacterium gordonae) species. Representative Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mitis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria were included as controls. Intact mycobacteria induced production of large amounts of IL-17, while IL-17 responses to control bacteria were negligible. Purified CD4(+) T cells, but not CD4-depleted cell fractions, produced this IL-17. Isolated mycobacterial surface lipids induced IL-17, but not IL-23 production. The ability of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria to induce IL-17 production in CD4(+) T cells was the same regardless of the pathogenic potential of the particular mycobacterial species.
TI  - Genome sequence of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) ATCC 9790, a model organism for the study of ion transport, bioenergetics, and copper homeostasis.
AB  - Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 is a Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium that has been used in basic research for over 4 decades. Here we report the sequence and annotation of the 2.8-Mb genome of E. hirae and its endemic 29-kb plasmid pTG9790.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - An agar diffusion study comparing the antimicrobial activity of Nanoseal with some other endodontic sealers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new experimental nano-hydroxyapatite epoxy resin-based sealer (Nanoseal) with several other commercially available sealers; AH26, Tubliseal, Sealapex and Roekoseal against Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Escherichia coli for up to 7 days. Agar diffusion was used in this study. Fifty Muller-Hinton agar plates were prepared and divided into five experimental groups (n = 10), for each micro-organism. Another 10 agar plates were used as positive and negative controls. Endodontic sealers were tested against each micro-organism. Inhibition zones produced were recorded. The results of this study showed that all test materials exhibited inhibition zones towards the tested micro-organisms for 7 days except for Roekoseal, which showed no inhibition zones. Nanoseal and AH26 exhibited similar zones of inhibition. Significant difference was found between Nanoseal and the other tested sealers (P < 0.001).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Molecular basis for different levels of tet(M) expression in Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates.
AB  - Seventy-four unrelated clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae harboring the tet(M) gene were studied. Seven strains with low tetracycline (Tc) MICs (0.25 to 0.5 mug/ml) were found to harbor truncated tet(M) alleles that were inactivated by different frameshift mutations. In contrast, five strains bore deletions in the tet(M) promoter region, among which four displayed increased Tc MICs (16 to 64 mug/ml). The same promoter mutations were detected in Tc-resistant mutants selected in vitro from various susceptible strains. Sequence analysis revealed that these deletions might impede the formation of the transcriptional attenuator located immediately upstream of tet(M). Expression in Enterococcus faecalis of a tet(M) reporter gene transcribed from these promoter mutants conferred a level of Tc resistance similar to that observed in the parental S. pneumoniae strains. These results show that different levels of Tc susceptibility found in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae can be explained by frameshift mutations within tet(M) and by alterations of the upstream transcriptional attenuator.
TI  - Antimicrobial and synergistic effects of silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil fungi of high altitudes of eastern himalaya.
AB  - Fifty three fungi isolated from soils of different microhabitats of eastern Himalayan range (3,400~3,600 msl) were screened for mycosynthesis of silver nanaoparticles (AgNPs) and their efficacy as antimicrobials were assessed in combination with commonly used antibiotics. Three isolates Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 identified based on morphological and 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to synthesize AgNPs. These nanoparticles were characterized by visual observation followed by UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis. The AgNPs synthesized by Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 showed absorbance maxima at 412, 419, and 421 nm respectively in the visible region. Transmission electron microscopy micrograph showed formation of spherical AgNPs of 5~50 nm size. The antimicrobial activity of the mycosynthesized nanoparticles were investigated alone and in combination with commonly used antibiotics for analysis of growth inhibition zone against test organisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC1925, Salmonella enterica MTCC735 and Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729. The mycosynthesized nanoparticles showed potent antibacterial activity and interestingly their syngergistic effect with erythromycin, methicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin was significantly higher as compared to inhibitions by AgNPs alone. The present study indicates that silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil borne indigenous fungus of high altitudes show considerable antimicrobial activity, deserving further investigation for potential applications.
TI  - The PavA-like fibronectin-binding protein of Enterococcus faecalis, EfbA, is important for virulence in a mouse model of ascending urinary tract infection.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is an established nosocomial pathogen, yet the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections, particularly of urinary tract infections (UTIs), remains to be fully elucidated. Fibronectin-binding proteins have been identified as potent adhesins in pathogenic Gram-positive cocci. Here, we characterized EfbA, which is encoded by the enterococcal orthologue of Streptococcus pneumoniae pavA. Similar to PavA, the anchorless EfbA protein was localized to the enterococcal cell outer surface and bound to immobilized human fibronectin. In addition to abrogated EfbA expression, deletion of the efbA gene eliminated EfbA from the cell surface and drastically reduced the enterococcal cell binding to immobilized fibronectin. The DeltaefbA deletion mutant was highly attenuated vs wild-type in a murine ascending UTI model, consistent with an increased tropism for the kidney relative to the bladder. These results provide the first evidence that EfbA of E. faecalis plays a role in UTIs, probably contributing to the pathogenesis in this site.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). After intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant Gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Because of its unique spectrum of activity, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-MRSA activity. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. Ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. The activity of ceftaroline is limited against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class B metallo-beta-lactamases or AmpC cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in phase III randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. Two identical trials (CANVAS 1 and CANVAS 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with cSSSI. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% CI -4.2, 2.0). An additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the FDA guidance definition of ABSSSI at treatment day 3. Clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 14.0). Clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with CAP was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase III trials (FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2). Of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against MRSA, patients with confirmed or suspected MRSA CAP were excluded from the FOCUS trials. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% CI 1.6, 11.8). An additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe CAP and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. CABP). Day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% CI -0.6, 20.6). In the phase III trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. Overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, as well as many common Gram-negative organisms. It is a welcome treatment option for ABSSSI and CABP.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Several species of Gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. Here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in Saudi Arabia. In the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among Staphylococcus aureus in the Kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. As yet, no vancomycin-resistant MRSA have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. Currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE) is low; however, VRE has been described in the Kingdom as well as Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. In recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in Saudi Arabia. The organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. On the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.
TI  - Identification, structural, and biochemical characterization of a group of large  Csn2 proteins involved in CRISPR-mediated bacterial immunity.
AB  - Many prokaryotic organisms acquire immunity against foreign genetic material by incorporating a short segment of foreign DNA called spacer into chromosomal loci, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). The encoded RNAs are processed into small fragments that guide the silencing of the invading genetic elements. The CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are the main executioners of these processes. Herein, we report the crystal structure of Stu0660 of Streptococcus thermophilus, a Cas protein involved in the acquisition of new spacers. By homotetramerization, Stu0660 forms a central channel which is decorated with basic amino acids and binds linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but not circular dsDNA. Despite undetectably low sequence similarity, two N-terminal domains of Stu0660 are similar to the entire structure of an Enterococcus faecalis Csn2 protein, which also forms a homotetramer and binds dsDNA. Thus, this work identifies a previously unknown group of Stu0660-like Csn2 proteins ( approximately 350 residues), which are larger than the known canonical Csn2 proteins ( approximately 220 residues) by containing an extra C-terminal domain. The commonly present central channel in the two subgroups appears as a design to selectively interact with linear dsDNA.
TI  - Lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. Lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. However, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of Gram positive pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. It is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. Here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.
TI  - Improved identification including MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of group D streptococci from bovine mastitis and subsequent molecular characterization of corresponding Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  - We examined 199 group D streptococci isolated from clinically defined and epidemiologically unrelated cases of bovine mastitis. Samples were collected during a 5-month period from 2010 to 2011 from diseased animals in 199 herds (1 isolate per herd) raised in different counties and federal states in Germany. A classical enterococcal species identification procedure started with PYRase and catalase assays, growth on Enterococcoselagar((R)) and GCG((R)) agar plates and in 6.5% NaCl followed by a biochemical reaction panel. All 199 isolates were also subjected to MALDI-TOF MS diagnostics in which a simple and an extended direct transfer protocol were compared. The latter revealed a much better performance (higher log (score) values) although the same result was obtained in all but three cases. Classical and MALDI TOF MS analyses identified 64 Enterococcus faecalis and 37 Enterococcus faecium isolates which were confirmed by species-specific PCRs. These 101 enterococcal isolates did not display a specific multi-resistance phenotype and resistances to glycopeptides and antibiotics of last resort (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) were absent, resistance to tetracycline was the most frequent resistance feature. Molecular typing of the 64 E. faecalis isolates revealed 3 main PFGE clusters of related strains represented by three MLST types (ST40, ST211, ST268). PFGE and MLST analysis of E. faecium isolates revealed several smaller clusters of only a few related strains and identified a number of previously unknown allele and MLST types (n=6; ST624-ST629) besides known variants (ST22, ST32). One of the 37 E. faecium strains showed properties of hospital-associated E. faecium strains (ampicillin resistance, IS16-positive; MLST CC17).
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - Decreased bacterial adherence and biofilm growth on surfaces coated with a solution of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Secondary biofilm formation by oral bacteria after breakdown/fracture of temporary or permanent restorations imposes a challenge to the outcome of root canal treatment. This study focuses on benzalkonium chloride (BAK) coating on dentin or polystyrene surfaces and its influence on the early adhesion and biofilm formation by oral and root canal bacteria. METHODS: Microbial adhesion and biofilm growth on surfaces coated with BAK were analyzed qualitatively with a dentin disk model and quantitatively with a mini-flow cell biofilm model. Cell viability and total biovolume were analyzed by the LIVE/DEAD technique. The repelling effect of surfaces coated with BAK was compared with NaOCl. Uncoated surfaces were used as controls. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscope images in the dentin disk model revealed that very sparse biofilms were formed on NaOCl- and BAK-coated dentin surfaces. In contrast, biofilms formed on uncoated dentin were clearly visible as numerous irregularly distributed aggregates of rods and cocci. In the mini-flow cell system, confocal laser scanning microscope analysis confirmed that biofilms formed on NaOCl- and BAK-coated surfaces showed significantly less adhesion (2 hours) and biovolume accumulation (24 and 96 hours) compared with the uncoated controls (P < .01). Furthermore, cell viability assessments showed that on uncoated controls the viability measurements were high (>89%) as well as on BAK-coated surfaces (88% viable cells). However, cell viability was significantly reduced on NaOCl-coated surfaces (59% viable cells). CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that surface coating with a surfactant solution containing BAK does not cause cell membrane damage but might interfere with cell mechanisms of adhesion. Investigations into the clinical utility of BAK as an antibiofilm medication are warranted.
TI  - Reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  - The on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. Here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The robustness of our approach lies in the novel method for the production of the SER substrate based on silver nanoparticles and their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. The method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial SERS substrates.
TI  - Sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  - We investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. Using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in Japan. Six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). Major causative bacteria detected were Escherichia coli (65.0 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), Streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). From 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were E. coli (61.5 %), E. faecalis (13.7 %), K. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and S. agalactiae (4.0 %). The sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cephems of E. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. In regard to infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [LVFX] >/=4 mug/mL), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of FQ administration within 1 month. Although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. The major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli were a history of FQ administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. It was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of FQ administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of signermycin B, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase WalK.
AB  - The WalK (histidine kinase)/WalR (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. This system is conserved in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a WalK inhibitor (signermycin B) by screening 10,000 Streptomyces extracts. The chemical structure (C(23)H(35)NO(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. Signermycin B exhibited antimicrobial activity, with MIC values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 muM) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 muM) against Gram-positive bacteria that possess the WalK/WalR two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin B against WalK in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 muM. To determine the mechanism of action of signermycin B, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two WalK domains of Bacillus subtilis and competition assay with ATP were performed. The results showed that signermycin B binds to the dimerization domain but not the ATP-binding domain of WalK. In the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin B did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of WalK dimers. These results suggest that signermycin B targets the conserved dimerization domain of WalK to inhibit autophosphorylation. In Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, signermycin B preferentially controlled the WalR regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. These phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the WalK/WalR system.
TI  - LiF Reduces MICs of Antibiotics against Clinical Isolates of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (LiF) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with LiF were performed by microdilution method. MICs were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. We observed reduced MICs of antibiotics associated with LiF ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. The strongest decreases of MICs observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with LiF against Acinetobacter baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against S. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against A. baumannii and S. pneumoniae. This suggests that LiF exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Worldwide appraisal and update (2010) of telavancin activity tested against a collection of Gram-positive clinical pathogens from five continents.
AB  - A total of 15,480 Gram-positive pathogens were collected from 89 sites in the United States, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America in 2010. Telavancin was active against indicated Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.5/0.5 mug/ml), and beta-hemolytic (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) and viridans group streptococcus (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 mug/ml) isolates. These MIC results showed potency for telavancin equal to or greater than that of comparators. These in vitro data confirm a continued potent activity of telavancin when tested against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (EMWI) on oral bacterial pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Gram-negative (Porphyromonas gingivalis) or Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, S. intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by EMW apparatus (500-1000 kHz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). Quantification of survival bacteria by CFU counting revealed that EMWI exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 kHz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. After EMWI at 500 kHz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of S. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (S. mutans and P. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. EMWI inhibited the inductive effect of S. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. Furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, EMWI partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that EMWI has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast United States.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in Northeast United States. METHODS: All vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from January 1988 to December 2008 were included in the study. The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (37.5%, n=60), Viridans Streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). Other common gram-positive isolates include Propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other Streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). The most common gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), Moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and Haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). Vancomycin was effective against all CoNS, Sta. aureus, Viridans Streptococcus, and E. faecalis tested, and all Sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. Of all CoNS isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in resistance (P=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). CoNS showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (P=0.010, P=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (P=0.003, P=0.040, respectively). Susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. CONCLUSION: Bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. The importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.
TI  - The surface lipids of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suppress production of phagocyte activating cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - The genus Mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens as well as opportunistic and  non-pathogenic species ubiquitous in the environment. Mycobacteria have a unique cell wall abundant in lipids. Here we investigated cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to the opportunistic mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus, the non-pathogenic Mycobacterium gordonae and extracted surface lipids from the three species. The cytokine response elicited by mycobacteria, regardless of their pathogenic potential, differed distinctly from that induced by control Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mitis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. Mycobacteria induced no IL-12 and less TNF and IFN-gamma compared with conventional Gram-positive bacteria. IL-10 was induced by all the mycobacteria and this production was partly responsible for the down-regulation of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. The capacity of the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis to induce IL-12, as well as TNF and IFN-gamma, in human PBMCs was strongly reduced when mycobacterial lipids were added. The mycobacterial surface lipids down-regulated the production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma without eliciting IL-10 production. Our results show that mycobacteria evade triggering production of phagocyte activating cytokines (IL-12, TNF and IFN-gamma) and that the mycobacterial cell wall surface lipids may play a significant role in this process.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid pDGL1 from Enterococcus durans and genetic characterization of the durancin GL locus.
AB  - Enterococci constitute a significant component of the lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal microflora and include strains that produce bacteriocins. The genetic determinants for durancin GL in Enterococcus durans 41D were identified on the 8347 bp plasmid pDGL1 by plasmid curing experiments. pDGL1 contained nine putative ORFs, with ORF1 and ORF2 encoding plasmid replication proteins, and ORF3 and ORF6 showing high similarity to genes encoding mobilization proteins. The predicted protein encoded by ORF4 showed 74 % identity to BacA, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis. The deduced DurA protein contained the conserved motif YYGNG, suggesting that durancin GL is a typical subclass IIa bacteriocin. ORF5 was shown to share 85 % identity to the immunity protein BacB of Enterococcus faecalis. ORF9 displayed 87 % sequence identity to a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function. To further clarify the minimum requirement for durancin GL production, a 547 bp fragment containing the durAB gene was fitted with the Streptococcus thermophilus P(2201) promoter and then subcloned and heterologously expressed in S. thermophilus ST128. The result demonstrated that the cloned fragment contained all the genetic components required for durancin GL production.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rare Streptomyces species against clinical resistant bacteria].
AB  - In the search for new antibiotics from Steptomyces, investigating extremes habitats enhances the probability of isolating novel producers. In this context, the antibacterial activity of four Streptomyces strains isolated from Ezzmoul saltpans was studied. Two of them showed antibacterial activity against antibiotic's resistant bacteria (Bacillus cereus: beta-lactamines and sulfamides resistant, Streptococcus faecalis: penicillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole resistant, and Staphylococcus aureus Mu 50: vancomycine resistant). The most active Streptomyces strain produces one type of polar bioactive molecules that resists to temperature variation and light exposition. Its activity appears in the first culture day and reaches its maximal value in the fourth day. The second strain presents themoresistant activity that reaches its maximal value in the first culture day. It produces two types of bioactive molecules, one is polar and the second is non polar (according to thin layer chromatography technique results).
TI  - [Diaper cystitis as recurrent cause of urinary infections in geriatric community  hospital].
AB  - AIM: Chronic cystitis in diaper-dependent elderly patients can be a causative pathology for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in community hospitals. METHODS: We analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from January 2007 to December 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. The reading causes of hospital infections were UTIs (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (CAP; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP; 17.2%). Of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, UTIs were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by CAP (n=809, 26%) and HAP (n=533, 17.2%). Of 278 UTIs in 2007, the causative strains were Escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), Enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), Proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (n=14, 13%) strains were noted in 106 patients with Escherichia coli. We then retrospectively examined the records of 110 diaper dependent elderly patients, (medical words, n=52, mix-care wards, n=68) for UTIs over the same study period. Of these 16 (14.5%) had no UTIs at any time, 12 (11%) were infected 50% of the time, 17 (15.5%) were infected 51% to 99% of the time and 65 (59%) were infected 100% of the time. The UTI rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. We treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. Antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. It remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients. The clinical dilemma of whether recurrent diaper cystitis should be treated and prohibit the growth and spread of drug-resistant strains, remains challenging.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sp Group F, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as IC(50) . Mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. Gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. Regarding phenolic extracts, GSE (grape seed extract) and GSE-O (oligomeric-rich fraction from GSE) were the ones that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentine and pulp extracellular matrix extracts.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether extracellular matrix (ECM) preparations from pulp (pECM) and dentine (dECM) possess antimicrobial activity. METHODOLOGY: Dentine and pulp ECM preparations were isolated with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.2 and sequential use of 0.5mol L(-1) NaCl, pH 11.7 and 0.1mol L(-1) tartaric acid, pH 2.0, respectively, with protease inhibitor inclusion throughout. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis and Enterococcus faecalis was assessed using turbidity as a measure of bacteria growth. The cytotoxicity of the extracts on primary pulp cells was also determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Statistical analysis of data was performed using paired student's t-tests. RESULTS: Extracellular matrix extracts from the pulp and dentine showed antibacterial activity against three types of anaerobic bacteria associated with dental disease (P< 0.05). The ECM extracts demonstrated no significant cytotoxic effect on pulpal cells at the concentrations used for antibacterial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic antibacterial activity of pECM and dECM indicates that the release of these matrix molecules from pulp and dentine may contribute to defence responses during dental disease, treatment and repair.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of MTAD and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTAD in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. METHODS: The survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with MTAD, MTAN (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and MTADN (nisin in combination with doxycycline). The survival rates of Enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the normal physiological state under MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and Porphyromonas gingivalis after MTAD and MTADN treatment. RESULTS: L. fermenti, L. paracasei, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, Streptococcus gordonii, and Peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to MTADN and MTAN than to MTAD. MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN showed a rapid antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to MTAD, MTAN, and MTADN as the control E. faecalis. Furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in A. naeslundii and L. paracasei presented significant rupture, and P. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after MTADN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MTAD in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. Therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. We enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. Similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). In symptomatic girls, the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). Bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly Proteus mirabilis (14.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and Escherichia coli (7.0%). The finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). Candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. The diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
TI  - Development of 4H-pyridopyrimidines: a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. Initial IC50's in aminoacylation/translation (A/T) assays ranged from 3 to14 muM. This series of compounds are variations on a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol scaffold (e.g., 4H-pyridopyrimidine). METHODS: Greater than 80 analogs were prepared to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Structural modifications included changes in the central ring and substituent modifications in its periphery focusing on the 2- and 6-positions. An A/T system was used to determine IC50 values for activity of the analogs in biochemical assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for each analog against cultures of Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli tolC mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN. RESULTS: Modifications to the 2-(pyridin-2-yl) ring resulted in complete inactivation of the compounds. However, certain modifications at the 6-position resulted in increased antimicrobial potency. The optimized compounds inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. coli tolC, mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN with MIC values of 4, </= 0.12, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1 mug/ml, respectively. IC50 values in biochemical assay were reduced to mid-nanomolar range. CONCLUSION: 4H-pyridopyrimidine analogs demonstrate broad-spectrum inhibition of bacterial growth and modification of the compounds establishes SAR.
TI  - Protection against Staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Type 1 lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against LTA have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated Enterococcus faecalis strains. In the present study, we show that antibodies against E. faecalis LTA also bind to type 1 LTA from other gram-positive species and opsonized Staphylocccus epidermidis and Staphylcoccus aureus strains as well as group B streptococci. Inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. Passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against E. faecalis LTA promoted the clearance of bacteremia by E. faecalis and S. epidermidis in mice. Furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine S. aureus peritonitis model. The effectiveness of rabbit antibody against LTA suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. METHODS: Four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. Simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. The LIVE/DEAD BacLight technique (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). Redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. RESULTS: The 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. The biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. A high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. The community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which E. faecalis, L. salivarius, and S. gordonii were most abundant. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. This multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.
TI  - Novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-GC content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - Bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. The presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-GC gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-GC content gram-positive bacteria. Here, through intensive MS analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an N-acyl-S-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-GC gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a TLR2-dependent and TLR1-independent manner but with a different dependence on TLR6. Additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. One is the "N-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing N-acetyl-S-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis. The N-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR2/6 heterodimer. The other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel TLR2-stimulating lyso and N-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.
TI  - Broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h NMR  spectroscopy.
AB  - To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (UTI), we applied (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. Study includes 682 urine samples from suspected UTI patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (GNB) (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (GPC) (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus). Acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine (TMA), citrate, trimethylamin-N-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. All urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. Multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) reveals that acetate, lactate, succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from UTI patients. This statistical analysis was also able to classify GNB to GPC infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). This technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing GNB and GPC infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. The determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of UTI patients.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - Effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide chrysophsin-1 on oral pathogens and Streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  - Dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  Controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. Chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and S. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. Cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) was investigated. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. Live/Dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM), was used to observe and analyze S. mutans biofilms. MIC and MBC results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. Lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by SEM. Furthermore, CLSM images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against S. mutans biofilms. Toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of HGFs in 5 min. Our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - Chemical and biological diversity in fourteen selections of four Ocimum species.
AB  - Biomass, essential oil yield, essential oil composition diversity, and antibacterial and antifungal activities of 14 selections of 4 Ocimum species [Ocimum basilicum L. (selections: T1-T10), O. gratissimum L. (selections: T11-T12), O. tenuiflorum L.f., syn. O. sanctum L. (selection: T13) and O. kilimandscharicum Baker ex. Guerke (selection: T14)] were investigated. O. basilicum selections T9 (methyl chavicol: 87.0%) and T10 {(Z)- and (E)-methyl cinnamate: 69.1%} produced higher biomass (67.8 and 56.7 t/ha) and oil (203.4 and 141.7 kg/ha) yields relative to 8 (T1-T8) linalool (up to 58.9%), or methyl chavicol (up to 61.8%) rich selections. O. gratissimum selection T12 (eugenol: 84.1%, 254.6 kg/ha oil yield) was significantly superior to T11 (62.1% eugenol and 18.4% camphor). O. tenuiflorum (T13, methyl eugenol: 72.5%) and O. kilimandscharicum (T14, camphor: 51.7%) produced 171.7 and 96.2 kg/ha essential oil, respectively. The essential oils exhibited broad spectrum antibacterial (against 5 Gram-positive and 7 Gram-negative bacteria) and antifungal (against 10 fungi) activities. The bacterial species Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the fungal species Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum gypseum, and Sporothrix schenckii were more sensitive to the essential oils.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of chinfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chinfloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of chinfloxacin in systemic infection was evaluated in a mouse peritonitis model using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP; n = 1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 2), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSE; n = 1), vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE; n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 1), PRSP (n = 1) and K. pneumoniae (n = 2). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, chinfloxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA [50% effective dose (ED(50)) 2.28-4.15 mg/kg], MRSA (ED(50) 14.75 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) 6.20 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) 3.51-5.03 mg/kg), VSE (ED(50) 25.02 mg/kg), VRE (ED(50) 5.18-15.39 mg/kg), E. coli (ED(50) 1.25-1.90 mg/kg) and K. pneumoniae (ED(50) 2.92-8.28 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of chinfloxacin was generally similar to (P > 0.05) that of moxifloxacin, significantly higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) than that of levofloxacin in Gram-positive isolate infections (MSSA, MRSA, PISP, PRSP, VSE and VRE), and less than that of levofloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae infections (P < 0.01). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, chinfloxacin showed potent activity towards S. pneumoniae (higher than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin and similar to or higher than ciprofloxacin) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of chinfloxacin in vivo. The high efficacy of chinfloxacin in murine systemic and local infections warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Endocarditis in a large district general hospital: A study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the United Kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. Infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. There are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the United Kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. In the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. The cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between December 2000 and January 2011 were examined. Microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. Of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with a mean age of 60.57 years. The most common organisms identified were Streptococcus species (31%), Staphylococcus aureus (27%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21%). The organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were S aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-HACEK group (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella species) pathogens such as Candida albicans. Streptococcus species and S aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the United Kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. Overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.
TI  - Salivary IgA antibody responses to Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans in preterm and fullterm newborn children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The intensities and specificities of salivary IgA antibody responses  to antigens of Streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, may influence colonization by these organisms during the first 1.5 year of life. Thus, the ontogeny of salivary IgA responses to oral colonizers continues to warrant investigation, especially with regard to the influence of birth conditions, e.g. prematurity, on the ability of children to efficiently respond to oral microorganisms. In this study, we characterised the salivary antibody responses to two bacterial species which are prototypes of pioneer and pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity (Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans, respectively) in fullterm (FT) and preterm (PT) newborn children. METHODS: Salivas from 123 infants (70 FT and 53 PT) were collected during the first 10h after birth and levels of IgA and IgM antibodies and the presence of S. mutans and S. mitis were analysed respectively by ELISA and by chequerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Two subgroups of 24 FT and 24 PT children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against S. mutans and S. mitis antigens, using Western blot assays. Cross-adsorption of 10 infant's saliva was tested to S. mitis, S. mutans and Enterococcus faecalis antigens. RESULTS: Salivary levels of IgA at birth were 2.5-fold higher in FT than in PT children (Mann-Whitney; P<0.05). Salivary IgA antibodies reactive with several antigens of S. mitis and S. mutans were detected at birth in children with undetectable levels of those bacteria. Adsorption of infant saliva with cells of S. mutans produced a reduction of antibodies recognizing S. mitis antigens in half of the neonates. The diversity and intensity of IgA responses were lower in PT compared to FT children, although those differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence that children have salivary IgA antibodies shortly after birth, which might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota, and that the levels of salivary antibody might be related to prematurity.
TI  - [The first experience of application of PCR techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  - The results comparison is made between PCR polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. From September to December 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. The blood samples for PCR analysis (SeptiFast technique Roche diagnostics, Switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. Among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. The species structure of identified germs was as follows: Enteroccocus Faecalis - 2, Klebsiella pneumonia - 2, Enteroccocusfaecium - 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative Staphilococcus - 11. All cases of seeding of coagulase negative Staphilococcus were interpreted using PCR techniques as negative or contamination. In four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. In cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the PCR techniques permitted to detect two positive results (Staphilococcus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). In three cases of positive hemoculture the PCR techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. The PCR techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. This techniques has to be applied in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.
TI  - Vancomycin tolerance in Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, represents the last line of defence against a wide range of multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci. However, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, along with vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates, are compromising the therapeutic efficacy of vancomycin. It is conceivable that tolerance may emerge during prolonged vancomycin use. It has not been until recently, however, that the molecular basis of this tolerance began to be understood. Superoxide anions might be involved in the bactericidal activity of vancomycin in enterococci, and recent evidence suggests that the stringent response is partly responsible for vancomycin tolerance in Enterococcus faecalis. The mechanism of vancomycin tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae is sometimes associated with a reduction of autolysin activity. Vancomycin tolerance in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae also appears to be somehow related with the two-component regulatory systems linked to cell envelope stress, although the precise molecular regulatory pathways remain poorly defined.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium WB2000 Inhibits Biofilm Formation by Oral Cariogenic Streptococci.
AB  - This study investigated the inhibitory effect of probiotic Enterococcus faecium WB2000 on biofilm formation by cariogenic streptococci. The ability of E. faecium WB2000 and JCM5804 and Enterococcus faecalis JCM5803 to inhibit biofilm formation by seven laboratory oral streptococcal strains and 13 clinical mutans streptococcal strains was assayed. The Enterococcal strains inhibited biofilm formation in dual cultures with the mutans streptococcal strains Streptococcus mutans Xc and Streptococcus sobrinus JCM5176 (P < 0.05), but not with the noncariogenic streptococcal strains. Enterococcus faecium WB2000 inhibited biofilm formation by 90.0% (9/10) of the clinical S. mutans strains and 100% (3/3) of the clinical S. sobrinus strains. After culturing, the pH did not differ between single and dual cultures. The viable counts of floating mutans streptococci were lower in dual cultures with E. faecium WB2000 than in single cultures. Enterococcus faecium WB2000 acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of cariogenic streptococcal biofilm formation.
TI  - Microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  - PURPOSE: Collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. In order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. METHODS: In a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from January 2009 to October 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. All the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. Cultures for common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. RESULTS: The most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. In particular, streptococci were found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. U. urealyticum was detected in 10% and Mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). No cases of N. gonorrhoeae were found. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical culture has a low concordance with endometrial culture. In fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. These results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of endodontic irrigants.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare in vitro, by MTT assay, the antimicrobial efficacy of Niclor 5 (5% NaOCl solution), Cloreximid (0.2% chlorhexidine and 0.2% cetrimide solution), 3% hydrogen peroxide and 17% EDTA against two microorganisms associated with primary endodontic infections. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans strains were selected for this test. Freshly extracted single-rooted human teeth were endodontically treated, inoculated with bacterial strains and then divided into different groups, each of them rinsed with Niclor 5 (5% NaOCl solution), Cloreximid (0.2% chlorhexidine and 0.2% cetrimide solution), 3% hydrogen peroxide,17% EDTA and with 5% NaOCl solution (positive control). RESULTS: Even though all the tested irrigating solutions demonstrated antibacterial effects against E. faecalis and S. mutans, the results were significantly different between the various groups. The greatest antimicrobial effects were observed in groups treated with 5% NaOCl and 17% EDTA. Interestingly, the effectiveness of EDTA could be ascribed to its capability of detaching biofilm from canal walls.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of six endodontic sealers.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to perform an in vitro evaluation of the antibacterial properties of 6 endodontic sealers (Endomethasone C, Argoseal, Bioseal Normal, Acroseal, AH Plus, Sicura Seal). METHODS: The agar diffusion test (well and paper disc methods) with Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans was used. For the well method, Petri dishes were inoculated with bacterial suspensions. Each well was completely filled with freshly mixed endodontic sealer. For the paper disc method, sterile paper discs were immersed in freshly mixed sealers and put on agar plates. Diameters of halos formed around the sealers were measured after 24 h and 48 h. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The effects of well method and of paper disc method were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Endomethasone C, Argoseal and Bioseal showed the largest inhibition halos for all the tested microorganisms, while Sicura Seal and AH Plus showed low antibacterial effects. Moreover, the comparison of well method and paper disc methods showed significant statistical differences (P<0,01) for all sealers and indicated a dose-dependent antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Photoactivated disinfection (PAD) in endodontics: an in vitro microbiological evaluation.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation by MTT test of the antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (PAD) and, comparatively, of a conventional 5.25% NaOCl irrigating solution. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis strains were selected for the test. Freshly extracted single-rooted human teeth were endodontically treated, inoculated with bacterial strains and then divided into different groups, each of them treated with PAD, with PAD plus 0.5% NaOCl solution, with TBO, with PAD for longer time and with 5% NaOCl solution (positive control). RESULTS: The results were significantly different among the various groups, and for Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. PAD applied for a longer time (in respect to manufacturer's instructions) or PAD associated to 5% NaOCl showed the significantly higher antibacterial effects.
TI  - Extracellular DNA in biofilms.
AB  - Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. Its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, then Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. Autolysis is the common mechanism by which eDNA is released. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. In E. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. In Staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. In S. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in S. epidermidis by the autolysin protein AtlE. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is located primarily in the stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. In S. aureus the crucial role of eDNA in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of DNase I. eDNA represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. eDNA and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the TLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
TI  - Telavancin activity tested against a contemporary collection of Gram-positive pathogens from USA Hospitals (2007-2009).
AB  - This study updates the activity of telavancin against Gram-positive pathogens collected from USA hospitals (2007-2009). Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/mL) was active against coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (100% susceptible), for which only daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(50/90), </= 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) exhibited similar activity. Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) inhibited 96.5% of Enterococcus faecalis at the Food and Drug Administration breakpoint (MIC, </= 1 mug/mL), where ampicillin (99.9% susceptible), daptomycin (99.9% susceptible), and linezolid (100% susceptible) also demonstrated high-level coverage. Telavancin inhibited, respectively, 100.0% and 91.7% of VanB-phenotype E. faecalis and E. faecium at </= 1 mug/mL, whereas it was less active against VanA strains. Telavancin was uniformly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant subsets, and demonstrated good potency (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL) against other streptococci, regardless of resistance to other drugs. This assessment reveals potent activity of telavancin against Gram-positive isolates collected from USA hospitals with no evidence of emergence of resistance.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline and linezolid among gram-positive isolates collected in the United States as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST) between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was initiated in 2004 to chart the activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms globally. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive organisms collected from the 9 census regions of the United States between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: The MICs and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. For tigecycline, US Food and Drug Administration susceptibility criteria were used. RESULTS: A total of 8782 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (54.5% methicillin-resistant S aureus) were collected, with the highest percentage of MRSA isolates collected from the South Central region (67.9%). All S aureus isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Overall, 4.6% of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3753) and 69.1% of Enterococcus faecium (n = 1417) isolates were vancomycin resistant, with the highest rates in the East North Central region for E faecalis (7.1%) and the South Atlantic region for E faecium (79.5%). Small numbers of linezolid nonsusceptible E faecalis (n = 13) were identified. MIC(90) values for tigecycline were </=0.25 mg/L against E faecalis and 0.12 mg/L against E faecium. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected (n = 4541), 1.1% were penicillin resistant. All S pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; susceptibility to tigecycline varied between 80.9% (Pacific region) and 95.2% (West North Central region). CONCLUSIONS: The rates of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp varied among the 9 census regions; however, susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline remained consistent, with low MIC(90) values and high rates of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against Campylobacter.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in live poultry. This finding is of relevance since Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. In the present work, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the cecum of twenty Tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against Campylobacter were further characterized. Following their preliminary confirmation as LAB, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16S- 23S PCR, specific lactobacilli PCR, and a biphasic approach. Most of the LAB isolated belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, among them Lb. sakei (33.3%), Lb. salivarius (19.4%), Lb. reuteri (8.6%), and Lb. curvatus (8.6%). The other LAB strains included those of the genus Weissella (16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), Lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and Streptococcus sp. (2.7%). The Lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against C. jejuni and C. coli. The activity of three of them, Lb. salivarius SMXD51, Lb. salivarius MMS122, and Lb. salivarius MMS151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different endodontic irrigants.
AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to compare in vitro the antibacterial activity of Tetraclean (mixture of doxycycline, citric acid and polypropylene glycol), Niclor 5 (5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution), Cloreximid (0.2% chlorhexidine and 0.2% cetrimide solution) and hydrogen peroxide 12 volumes on three endodontic pathogens associated with primary endodontic infections. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus strains were selected to evaluate the antibacterial activity of endodontic irrigants by the agar disc-diffusion test. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paper discs were saturated with each one of the test solutions (at room temperature and preheating at 50 degrees C) and placed onto culture agar-plates preadsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The growth inhibition zones around each irrigant were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were applied to compare the various groups. RESULTS: At room temperature, Tetraclean showed significantly higher inhibition of bacteria growth than all other irrigants tested. Preheating at 50 degrees C significantly increased growth inhibition for all the groups tested. At 50 degrees C, hydrogen peroxide 12 volumes and Tetraclean showed significantly higher efficacy than all other irrigants tested. CONCLUSIONS: 50 degrees C-preheated hydrogen peroxide 12 volumes and Tetraclean showed highest inhibition of the bacterial growth.
TI  - Synergistic effect of thermal energy on bactericidal action of photolysis of H(2)O(2) in relation to acceleration of hydroxyl radical generation.
AB  - The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of thermal energy on the yield of and the bactericidal action of hydroxyl radical generated by photolysis of H(2)O(2). Different concentrations of H(2)O(2) (250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mM) were irradiated with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at a wavelength of 400 +/- 20 nm at 25 degrees C to generate hydroxyl radical. The 500 mM H(2)O(2) was irradiated with the LEDs at different temperatures (25, 35, 45, and 55 degrees C). Electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the yield of hydroxyl radicals increased with the temperature, as well as the concentration of H(2)O(2). Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis were used in the bactericidal assay. The LED-light irradiation of the bacterial suspensions in 500 mM H(2)O(2) at 25 degrees C could hardly kill the bacteria within 3 min, while the bactericidal effect was markedly enhanced with the temperature rise. For instance, a temperature increase to 55 degrees C resulted in >99.999% reduction of viable counts of both bacterial species only within 1 min. The photolysis of 500 mM H(2)O(2) at 55 degrees C could reduce the viable counts of bacteria more efficiently than did the photolysis of 1,000 mM H(2)O(2) at 25 degrees C, although the yields of hydroxyl radical were almost the same under the both conditions. These findings suggest that the thermal energy accelerates the generation of hydroxyl radical by photolysis of H(2)O(2), which in turn results in a synergistic bactericidal effect of hydroxyl radical and thermal energy.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - The microbial flora associated with oral carcinomas.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Changes in the microbial flora on the oral mucosa after cancerous alteration may lead to both local and systemic infections. In this study, we assessed the microbial flora associated with the surfaces of oral squamous cell carcinoma. A comparative evaluation of these microbial contents was made with that of the contralateral healthy mucosa and control (healthy) mucosa. We also assessed the microbial flora from the saliva culture in subjects with oral squamous cell carcinoma and healthy controls. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The case control study was made up of 30 subjects with oral squamous cell carcinoma as the study group; 30 healthy age-, sex-, habit-, and dentition-matched subjects served as the control group. In the study group, microbial samples were collected from the carcinoma site, contralateral healthy mucosa, and saliva, whereas in the control group, samples were collected from the healthy mucosa and saliva. These samples were stored on ice and subsequently transported to the laboratory in 2 mL of thioglycollate transport media, where the microbial cultures were carried out. RESULTS: Oral squamous cell carcinoma sites harbor significantly more microbial flora (bacteria and yeasts) compared to those of healthy mucosa (control group). The microbial flora predominantly isolated from the carcinoma site were Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus species, Moraxella species, Enterococcus feacalis, Aerobic spore bearers, Klebsiella species, Citrobacter species, Proteus species, Pseudomonas species, and Candida albicans. The median number of colony forming units (CFU)/mL at carcinoma sites (3.85 x 105 CFU/mL) was significantly higher than that of the healthy mucosa (0.571 x 105 CFU/mL; P = .0000, Wilcoxon nonparametric test). Similarly, in saliva of carcinoma subjects, the median number of CFU/mL (2.408 x 105 CFU/mL) was significantly higher than that of saliva in control subjects (0.78 x 105 CFU/mL; P = .0000, Wilcoxon nonparametric test). CONCLUSION: The present study clearly indicates that the subjects with oral squamous cell carcinoma harbor significantly more microbial flora. Emphasis has to be given to preventing microbial flora in the oral cavity and treating these patients with appropriate antimicrobial agents, thus reducing their morbidity.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity and synergistic/antagonistic effect of interactions between antibiotics and some spice essential oils.
AB  - Spices and herbs have been used for many years by different cultures. The aim of  the present study is (1) to investigate in-vitro antimicrobial effects of different spices and herbs (5 species: Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary), Coriandrum sativum (coriander), Micromeria fruticosa (L.) Druce subsp. Brachycalyx P.H. Davis (White micromeria), Cumium cyminum (cumin), Mentha piperita (Peppermint) against different bacteria and fungi species, and (2) to discuss the in-vitro possible effects between the plants and antibiotics. The microorganisms used were Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Bacillus brevis FMC 3, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Pseudomonas pyocyaneus DC 127, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067, Escherichia coil DM, Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Yersinia enterocolitica AU 19, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Streptococcus faecalis DC 74 bacteria, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae WET 136, Kluvyeromyces fragilis DC 98 fungi in this study. The results indicated that essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis, Coriandrum sativum L., Micromeria fruticosa (L.) Druce subsp. brachycalyx P.H. Davis, Cumium cyminum L., Mentha piperita L. were shown antimicrobial activity in the range of 7-60 mm 2 microl(-1) inhibition zone to the microorganisms tested, using disc diffusion method. Standard antibiotic such as Gentamicin (10 microg), Cephalothin (30 microg), Ceftriaxone (10 microg), Nystatin (10 U) discs were used for comparison with the antimicrobial activities of essential oils of these plants. In addition, antibacterial activity of essential oils of these plants was researched by effects when it was used together with these standard antibiotics in vitro. However, antibacterial activity changed also by in vitro interactions between these standard antibiotics and essential oils of these plants. Synergic, additive or antagonist effects were observed in antibacterial activity.
TI  - Streptococcus gallolyticus prosthetic joint infection associated with undiagnosed colonic malignancy.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is a group D streptococcus which was previously classified as part of the S. bovis/S. equinus complex. It is a rare pathogen in prosthetic joint infection but has been demonstrated to have a strong association with colorectal carcinoma. In this case, a patient with no symptomatology suggestive of colorectal carcinoma presented with a S. gallolyticus prosthetic joint infection. Awareness of the association prompted investigation and subsequent diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma which was successfully treated prior to two-stage revision knee replacement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.
TI  - Bacterial and Candida albicans adhesion on different root canal filling materials and sealers.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation on endodontic root canal filling materials and sealers lead to survival of microorganisms in treated root canals and subsequently to endodontic treatment failures. The present study focused on initial microbial adhesion to different endodontic filling materials. METHODS: The following endodontic biomaterials were tested: AH-Plus, Tubli Seal, gutta-percha, Real Seal SE, EndoREZ, Apexit Plus, GuttaFlow, and dentin. Samples of each material were prepared. Bovine dentin samples were used as a control. The initial adhesions of salivary bacteria as well as the subsequent single species were quantified by determination of colony-forming units (CFUs) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (CLSM): Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida albicans, and Prevotella nigrescens. RESULTS: Initially adherent microorganisms could be detected and microscopically visualized on each of the materials tested. Considering the values of the CFUs and the covering grade as detected by CLSM, there were significant differences among the materials. Fewer bacteria tended to adhere to Apexit Plus, whereas Real Seal SE and the widely used gutta-percha showed the highest number of adherent bacteria. This tendency was not detected for C. albicans. CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic microorganisms have a high affinity to root canal filling materials and sealers, especially to gutta-percha. Because of this high level of bacterial adhesion, subsequent biofilm formation on these materials could be suggested as leading to the persistence of microorganisms in root canals.
TI  - Influence of synthetic peptide inducers on antibacterial activity of enterococci.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of probiotic enterococci is often related to the production of bacteriocins. There is a variety of Enterococcus faecium strains which synthesise one or several enterocins including A, B, P, 96, L50AB and others. In this work we have analysed the probiotic strain E. faecium L3 whose genome contained the genes encoding enterocins capital A, Cyrillic, capital VE, Cyrillic and a three-component regulatory system. All these genes were found to be expressed in enterococcal strain L3. Antimicrobial activity of the strain tested on the strains of Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae was pheromone dependent. Chemically synthesised cyclic peptides (analogues and shorter derivates of EntF) with different molecular structures were able to increase the antagonistic activity of the strain E. faecium L3 in contrast to the strain E. faecium SF68, which does nsmall o, Cyrillict have genes encoding enterocins capital A, Cyrillic and capital VE, Cyrillic.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives.
AB  - A series of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives was synthesized. Antimicrobial activity assessment indicates that compounds 1, 26, 27 and 28 exhibit strong activity against gram-positive bacterial strains, including Beta-hemolytic streptococcus CMCC32210, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212 and methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300 (MRSA). Compound 27 shows the best anti-MRSA activity with an MIC value of 0.031 mug/ml. To assess the mechanism of action, the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV were also measured. The results indicate that compound 1 has strong inhibitory effects on the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supercoiling activity and S. aureus Topo IV relaxing activity.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.

TI  - Evaluation of the incidence of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.
AB  - AIMS: To report the incidence of infectious and noninfectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from a multicenter clinical trial in Japan. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter review of the data of patients who received intravitreal anti-VEGF injections between January 2007 and March 2011 was undertaken. Cases with the clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis resulting from intravitreal injection were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 5,236 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (1,209 intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, 3,827 injections of ranibizumab, and 200 injections of pegaptanib sodium) had been administered. Five patients (0.095%), all of whom had received bevacizumab, were diagnosed as having endophthalmitis after the intravitreal injection. All patients visited the institutes for re-examination within 1-2 days after the injection. Among the 5 patients, 2 (0.038%) were culture positive for Streptococcus oralis and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. The remaining 3 eyes (0.057%) developed presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Although endophthalmitis is a rare complication associated with intravitreal injection, in this series intravitreal anti-VEGF injection caused infectious or noninfectious endophthalmitis at a relatively high frequency. Further investigations are needed to consider an appropriate injection protocol for minimizing the incidence rates of endophthalmitis, and to assess the optimal treatment protocol for intravitreal injection-related endophthalmitis although it was difficult to differentiate these two entities.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on tyramine (TYR) and also other biogenic amines (BA) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (FBP) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) was investigated by using a rapid HPLC method. Significant differences were observed among the FBP strains in ammonia (AMN) and BA production apart from tryptamine, histamine (HIS) and spermine formation (p<0.05). Salmonella paratyphi A was characterised as the main amine producer. LAB had an important synergetic role in some BA production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some LAB strains on BA production was strain-dependent. Lactococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher TYR accumulation by Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus faecalis in TDB. The presence of Lactococcus and/or Lactobacillus in TDB significantly increased HIS production by A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas HIS accumulation was significantly reduced by Staphylococcus aureus, S. paratyphi A and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy Enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  - A tetracycline-resistant (Tet(r)) dairy Enterococcus faecium isolate designated M7M2 was found to carry both tet(M) and tet(L) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. After consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (ORFs), including a tet(M)-tet(L)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pRE25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin (TA) plasmid stabilization system. The derived backbone plasmid without the Tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a TA-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. The tet(M)-tet(L) gene cluster from M7M2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF by electroporation and in Streptococcus mutans UA159 by natural transformation. Southern hybridization showed that both the tet(M) and tet(L) genes were integrated into the chromosome of S. mutans UA159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in E. faecalis OG1RF. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(M) and tet(L) genes of pM7M2. The results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pM7M2, pIP816, and pRE25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - Validation of the Zurich burn-biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn-wound excision, bacterial infection remains a major problem in the management of burn victims today. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a polyspecies biofilm model with bacteria known to cause severe infections in burn patients. The model is simple to prepare, maintain and analyse, and allows for short-term exposure to antimicrobials. RESULTS: Initial experiments showed that it was impossible to establish balanced polyspecies biofilms with an inoculum of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. After 64.5 h of incubation, the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) had suppressed the Gram-positives (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus intermedius). However, adding the Gram-negative bacteria after 41.5 h to an established biofilm of Gram-positives resulted in a balanced microbial consortium. After 64.5 h, all species were present in high numbers (10(7) to 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per biofilm). Multiple repetitions showed high reproducibility of biofilm formation without significant differences between and within experiments. Combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation/confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH/CLSM) analyses, for which biofilms had to be grown on a different non-flexible substrate (hydroxy apatite), revealed that, by 41.5 h, the biofilm consisted of an almost confluent layer of bacteria firmly adherent to the substratum. After 64.5 h (22 h after the addition of the Gram negatives), the biofilm consisted of a confluent mixture of single cells, an abundance of galaxies of bacteria with small lacunae and large amounts of extracellular matrix polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: The polyspecies biofilm model contains the most prevalent burn-associated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and mimics the Gram-negative shift observed in vivo. It shows excellent reproducibility. It should allow adaptation to the bacterial spectrum prevalent in different burn centres and lead to a much more reliable investigation of the efficiency of topical antimicrobial agents than models operating with planktonic bacteria. The experiments further open up the perspective to create an in vivo model using these biofilms as infectious agents.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Effect of functional yogurt NY-YP901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt NY-YP901 (Namyang Dairy Product Co. Ltd and Nutra R&BT Inc., Seoul, Korea) supplemented with mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing Bifidobacterium breve (CBG-C2), Enterococcus faecalis FK-23, fibersol-2 and so on. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. Treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt NY-YP901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. Body weight and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with HbA1C and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. Inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. RESULTS: During the period August 2009 to December 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. Treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. In the treatment group consuming NY-YP901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, P<0.05), BMI (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), P<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, P<0.05) after 8 weeks. The change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The functional yogurt NY-YP901 reduced LDL-cholesterol, body weight and BMI in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. From these findings, regular intake of functional yogurt NY-YP901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.
TI  - Population biology of Gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and S. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. Population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force of genetic diversity in E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. Although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of S. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. In this review, we discuss the population genetics of E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.
TI  - Tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. It is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). Conjugative transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. The ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for JNJ-Q2, a  novel quinolone.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel fluorinated 4-quinolone in development for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This quality control (QC) study was performed to establish ranges for control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.015 to 0.06 mug/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.5 to 2 mug/ml and 17 to 23 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.008 to 0.03 mug/ml and 30 to 36 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.002 to 0.015 mug/ml and 31 to 39 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml and 28 to 35 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (32 to 38 mm). These ranges will be crucial in evaluating JNJ-Q2 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial adhesion and cellular proliferation on newly developed three-dimensional scaffolds manufactured by rapid prototyping technology.
AB  - Scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. For the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3D-scaffolds. The cell growth of human osteosarcoma cells (CAL-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (PLGA, PLLA, PLLA-TCP) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguinis). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (CFU) were performed. The cell proliferation rates on PLLA and PLLA-TCP after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on PLGA. On day 3 the proliferation rates on PLLA and PLLA-TCP, and on day 5 on PLLA-TCP, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). The strain which showed the most CFUs on all of the investigated scaffolds was P. gingivalis, followed by E. faecalis. No significant CFU differences were determined examining P. gingivalis among the biomaterials. In contrast, E. faecalis was significantly more adherent to PLGA and PLLA compared to PLLA-TCP. The lowest CFU values were seen with C. albicans and P. nigrescens. Salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to PLGA compared to PLLA-TCP. These results supported by SEM point out the high potential of PLLA-TCP in the field of tissue engineering.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of continuous (CI) and intermittent infusion (ITI) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. METHODS: Twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. Half of the patients received ertapenem as an ITI 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via CI over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. Blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24 h after terminating ITI or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting CI for each patient. After centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees C until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. RESULTS: Median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fCmax = 98.9 mg/L and fCmin = 2.5 mg/L for ITI, and fCss=15.9 mg/L for CI. The ITI and CI median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 L/h vs. 2.5 L/h and 15.4 L vs. 21.0 L, respectively. The ertapenem MIC ranges were as follows: Escherichia coli (0.006 to 0.5 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/L), Streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/L). ITI and CI provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the MIC for all bacteria. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem exhibited satisfactory PK/PD parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high MIC of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. CI administration resulted in equally effective PK/PD parameters as ITI in normal weight, good renal-function patients.
TI  - Microbicidal activities of low frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jets on oral pathogens.
AB  - Research using low frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jets (LF jet) is becoming increasingly more common. We carried out experiments to evaluate the sterilizing effects of this technology on oral pathogenic microorganisms (S.mutans, C.albicans and E. faecalis) and to determine its potential for clinical application. We performed the direct exposure test on a solid surface, indirect exposure test on a liquid phase, and ROS (reactive oxygen species) inhibitory test. The results showed the LF jet had microbicidal effects on oral pathogens, and that the ROS influenced this sterilization effect. The experiments of this study revealed that LF jet had a sterilizing effect on oral pathogenic microorganisms present in both the solid and liquid phases. The sterilizing mechanism was considered to be related to the effect of superoxide anion radicals. These results indicate that LF jets may represent a novel technology that can be applied to the field of clinical dentistry.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of MX-2401, an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide active in the presence of lung surfactant.
AB  - MX-2401 is an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic selective for Gram-positive bacteria that is a semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring lipopeptide amphomycin. It was active against Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus (VSE), vanA-, vanB-, and vanC-positive vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), linezolid- and quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates (MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml), and Streptococcus spp. including viridans group streptococci, and penicillin-resistant, penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-intermediate and macrolide-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml). MX-2401 demonstrated a dose-dependent postantibiotic effect varying from 1.5 to 2.4 h. Furthermore, MX-2401 was rapidly bactericidal at 4 times the MIC against S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, with more than 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial attained at 4 and 24 h, respectively. The MICs of MX-2401 against MRSA, MSSA, VSE, and VRE strains serially exposed for 15 passages to sub- to supra-MICs of MX-2401 remained within three dilutions of the original MIC. In contrast to that of the lipopeptide daptomycin, the antibacterial activity of MX-2401 was not affected in vitro by the presence of lung surfactant, and MX-2401 was active in vivo in the bronchial-alveolar pneumonia mouse model, in which daptomycin failed to show any activity. Moreover, the activity of MX-2401 was not as strongly dependent on the Ca(2+) concentration as is the activity of daptomycin. In conclusion, MX-2401 is a promising new-generation lipopeptide for the treatment of serious infections with Gram-positive bacteria, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from systemic infections and reported for evaluation  and antibiotic resistance surveillance by the "Dr. Victor Babes" Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest].
AB  - AIM: Testing antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains (compulsor, reported for  EARSS surveillance) isolated from patients hospitalised for systemic infection in the "Dr. V. Babe" Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases during 01.01.2005-11.11.2009, for a dynamic evaluation and for the surveillance of resistance emergence for certain classes of antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial isolation: BacT/ALERT system; strain identification in classic and automated system (ATB Expression. VITEK 2C): antibioresistance: disk-difussion method (NCCLS 2005--CLSI 2009), MIC (E-Test, ATB/ Expression, VITEK 2C). Screening of ESBL-producing strains performed with double disk-difussion method (DDD). Reference strains used: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, E. coli A TCC 25922, Enterococcus fiecalis ATCC 29212. RESULTS: During the studied period, 245 bacterial strains have been isolated, identified and tested (Staphylococcus aureus / 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae / 61, Enterococcus faecalis / 18, Enterococcus faecium / 5, Neisseria meningitidis / 18, E. coli / 73). out of 166 hemocultures and 79 cerebrospinal fluids / CSF. The average incidence of MRSA strains in systemic infections was 34.28%. 44.28% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin, 17.14% to cyprofloxacyne, 15.71% to rifampicine, 14.49% to gentamycine. No strain resistant to vancomycine and linezolide. Streptococcus pneumoniae presented an average high resistance to penicillin G of 11.47%. and a 1.63% resistance to third generation cephalosporines. 0% resistance to vancomycine and rifampicine. 7/ 18 Enterococcus faecalis strains and 4/5 Enterococcus faecium strains presented high level resistance to gentamycine (CN 120 microg/disk) and no strain was resistant to vancomycine, teicoplanin or linezolid. The 18 Neisseria meningitidis strains were all sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and cloramphenicol. For the 73 Escherichia coli strains, the average incidence of ESBL-producing isolates was 10.95%, the average resistance to ampicillin was 58.90%, to gentamycine--13.88% and to cyprofloxacin--20.83%. No strain resistant to carbapenemes and amikacine. CONCLUSIONS: For the systematic surveillance of antibiotic resistance there is a need for a harmonised protocol of data gathering and strain selection and the rigurous implementation of correct evaluating methods for antibiotic resistance in the microbiology laboratory. Carbapenemes. glycopeptides and oxazolidinones still present a major effectiveness in the first intention treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance evaluation of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 1044 strains: 610 Staphylococcus aureus (352 from patients, 258 from carriers), 203 Streptococcus pneumoniae (53 from patients, 150 from carriers), 144 Enterococcus faecalis. 57 Enterococcus faecium and 30 Streptococcus spp. using automatic systems Vitek 2 Compact. MicroScan, disc diffusion method and Etest according to 2008 CLSI. A number of 497 Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested for eritromycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 33.2% MRSA for strains isolated from patients and 30.0% from carriers. From MRSA strains. 35.5% were resistant to gentamicin. 33.6% to ciprofloxacin, 74.3% to erythromycin and 30.5% to rifampin. There were no S. aureus strain resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. S. aureus strains isolated from wounds were more resistant to erythromycin (43.9%) than the strains isolated from systemic infections (12.1%). From 11 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis, 4 were resistant to penicillin. Neither S. pneumoniae strain isolated from other infections, nor those from carriers had MIC to penicillin more than 4 microg/ml. S. pneumoniae strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to erythromycin. clindamycin and tetracycline than the strains isolated from patients (66.7%, 54.1%, 54.2% vs. 27.4%, 22.6%, 33.9%). E. faecium was 95.9% resistant to penicillin, 90.2% to ampicillin, 64.7% to gentamicin, 72.0% to streptomycin and 78.4% to ciprofloxacin. F. faecalis was less resistant than E. faecium at most of the antibiotics: 32.4% to gentamicin, 59.6% to streptomycin, 28.5% to ciprofloxacin. Viridans group Streptococci, all isolated from blood culture were 92% susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. To erythromycin, 12% of viridians group Streptococci were resistant. S. pyogenes resistance to eritromycin was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus strains showed a relatively high level of resistance to oxacillin (33.2%) and resistance in the same time to several antibiotics. S. pneumoniae can not be considered resistant to penicillin administrated parenteral, with exception of the strains isolated from meningitis. E. faecium had a higher resistance rate than E. faecalis.
TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Antimicrobial effectiveness of different preparations of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracanal medicaments have an antibacterial effect on the root canal flora. The effectiveness of such vehicles has to be tested and substantiated against the normal bacterial flora. The various vehicles that were tested for their effectiveness were commercially prepared calcium hydroxide (Metapex), saline, glycerine, CMCP, and Rexidine-M gel. The bacterial cultures tested for sensitivity were aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pyogens, Enterococcus faecalis), anaerobes (Lactobacillus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus) and a commonly found fungus (Candida albicans). One hundred and twenty-five samples were divided into five experimental groups consisting of 21 samples each and one control group of the same size. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the influence of four different vehicles on the effectiveness of calcium hydroxide against the commonly found aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in endodontic infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples were taken and transported using standardized techniques and pure growth of each bacterium was isolated. Petri dishes were prepared for the various calcium hydroxide combinations for each bacterium and incubated. The inhibition zone was recorded at three intervals of 24, 96 and 168 hours. Results were tabulated and sent for statistical analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: It was seen that calcium hydroxide and CMCP combination showed the maximum zone of inhibition, and maximum inhibitory effect was seen at 24 hours. The bacteria most susceptible was found to be S. aureus and the least susceptible was E. faecalis. Further clinical studies are required to substantiate these results.
TI  - Microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  - PURPOSE: Advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. Recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. A prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. RESULTS: Upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. On determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and 18.8% were resistant. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive organisms collected between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - This study reports the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobials, including linezolid, against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) between 2004 and 2009. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using broth microdilution methodology according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined according to CLSI criteria. For tigecycline, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved criteria were used. Overall, 41.3% (8249/19 982) of S. aureus collected were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All MRSA were susceptible to linezolid and 99.98% were susceptible to tigecycline. A total of 2.3% of E. faecalis (201/8576) and 39.7% of E. faecium (1226/3088) were vancomycin-resistant. Linezolid and tigecycline MIC(90) values (MIC at which 90% of isolates inhibited) against the Enterococcus spp. were 2mg/L and </= 0.25 mg/L, respectively. All S. pneumoniae [including 6.2% (599/9618) penicillin-non-susceptible] were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; tigecycline MIC(90) values were </= 0.12 mg/L. This report demonstrates the continuing good activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive isolates globally, including resistant organisms such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, with antimicrobial activity maintained over the 6 years of isolate collection.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(3-alkoxyimino-4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(3-alkoxyimino-4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. All of the target compounds have potent antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, and exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs: 0.125-4 mug/mL). Compound 22, with the best activity against Gram-positive strains, is 4-16 fold more potent than gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin against Enterococcus faecalis, and 16- and 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against S. epidermidis 09-6 and S. pneumoniae 08-4, respectively.
TI  - Evaluating the In-vitro Antibacterial Effect of Iranian Propolis on Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - Propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. Current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. There have been few studies on the effects of Iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. In this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the Iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of Tehran was evaluated. Susceptibility of the oral strains tested (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9222; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 9854 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/mL of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. Antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at different concentrations of propolis. The ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with MIC and MBC ranges of 250-500 microg/mL. The MIC concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/mL against S. mutans and E. faecalis. The water extract showed bactericidal activity only against S. mutans (20 mg/mL). These results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. However, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of Iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
TI  - Effect of garlic on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of garlic extract on the biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans on orthodontic wire and on glucosyltransferase gene expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Growth inhibition of oral bacteria was tested after 50 microL of garlic extract was placed on an agar plate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of garlic extract on S mutans growth was first determined. After cultivating streptococci in biofilm medium (BM)-sucrose with garlic extract and orthodontic wire, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement and viable cell counting was performed from the bacteria attached on the wire. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of morphology was observed on bacterial cells attached to orthodontic wire. The effect of garlic extract on gene expression was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of glucosyltransferase. RESULTS: Though garlic extract had a clear antibacterial effect on all microorganisms, it also enhanced S mutans attachment on orthodontic wire. Low concentration of garlic extract also increased glucosyltransferase gene expression of S mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its antibacterial function, garlic extract increases biofilm formation by S mutans to orthodontic wire, likely through upregulation of glucosyltransferase expression. Garlic extract may thus play an important role in increased bacterial attachment to orthodontic wires.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2009].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2009, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms was available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.06 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was equal to that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 2 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 8 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/mL and were 1 to 2 times lower than those of GRNX, 2 to 4 times lower than those of MFLX, and 16 to 32 times lower than those of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.25 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 2 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for E. coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90s of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 8 microg/mL and was 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 2 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 16 times lower than that of LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 2 to 4 times lower than those of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX, and 4 times lower than those of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.008 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - Spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  - Bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. The characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. The clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation from January 1997 to March 2006 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (GPB), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). Nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset GPB or GNB versus patients with late-onset GPB (66.7% versus 23.7%, P < 0.001) or GNB (70.6% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001). Peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, P = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, P = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset GPB versus patients with late-onset GPB. Likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset GNB than late-onset GNB (41.2% versus 6.7%, P = 0.007). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GPB, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus species were most common in patients with late-onset GPB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GNB, whereas Escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset GNB. In conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative isolates. This study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis with elevated MICs. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). No streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased MICs (defined as an increase in MIC of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. Ceftaroline MICs for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive H. influenzae with a mutation in L22. One H. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline MIC (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. The ceftaroline MIC for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. MICs for S. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. No S. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased MIC (>4-fold) after 50 passages. Two E. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline MICs increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32 mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. The parental ceftaroline MIC for the one K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of Minasia alpestris (Asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  - This work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of Minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against E. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]=40 microg mL(-1)) and S. sobrinus (MIC=60 microg mL(-1)) was observed.
TI  - Use of daptomycin in complicated cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious form of infection with a high mortality. Medical management can be a challenge because of organ dysfunction, lack of clinical response or allergy to the recommended antibiotics. Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with a potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. There are limited data on the use of daptomycin in complicated cases of IE. We aim to report our experience of daptomycin use in complicated cases of IE through a prospective observational study (from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009). Daptomycin was prescribed for cases that were either unresponsive or allergic to the standard therapy. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. Success was defined as clinical improvement accompanied with the resolution of laboratory markers of sepsis and continuation of the above findings for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy. Eight cases were evaluable. Native and prosthetic valves were involved in equal proportions. The range of organisms was wide: Staphylococcus aureus, two cases; S. epidermidis, two cases; streptococci, two cases; and Enterococcus faecalis, two cases. The median duration of therapy was 42 days. All patients were successfully treated. Daptomycin was well tolerated. Daptomycin is useful in the management of complicated cases of IE.
TI  - Probiotic assessment of Enterococcus faecalis CP58 isolated from human gut.
AB  - A total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16S rDNA genes. Of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low pH conditions. Species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus anginosus. These strains were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. E. faecalis was the most adherent strain. Examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaAfs, gelE, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many E. faecalis isolates from food sources. The cytolysin biosynthetic genes cylA, cylB and cylM that are more associated with the clinical isolates of E. faecium were not detected in this strain. The antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. These data suggest that the strain E. faecalis CP58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine paste and other intracanal medications against bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of four formulations of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] pastes against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: A broth dilution test was performed, and the lengths of time for different pastes to kill the microbial cells were recorded and statistically analyzed. The following medications were assessed: Group I - Ca(OH)(2) + 2.0% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel; Group II - Ca(OH)(2) + camphorated paramonochlorophenol (CMCP) and propylene glycol; Group III - Ca(OH)(2) + propylene glycol; Group IV - Ca(OH)(2) + saline. RESULTS: The results showed that E. faecalis was the most resistant microorganism. Groups II and III eliminated all the microbial cells in 15 seconds. Group I took 45 seconds to eliminate E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, it was concluded that all the intracanal medications tested showed antibacterial activity. However, the association of Ca(OH)(2) and PMCC or Ca(OH)(2) and propylene glycol showed a better performance, since Groups II and III took a shorter length of time than the other groups to eliminate S. aureus and E. faecalis.
TI  - Monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly detection of colorectal cancer.
AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods that often lead to treatment failure. Intestinal microbiota has long been considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer, precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into colorectal cancer. Further population-based epidemiological study is useful to reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for the colorectal cancer.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. Diversity of RAPD types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical transfer of intestinal LAB from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Comparative genome-wide analysis of small RNAs of major Gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  - In the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. Therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. The detection of small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. Several experimental technologies to predict sRNA have been established for the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. In many respects, sRNA screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of sRNAs for Gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of sRNAs in colonization and pathogenicity for Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. Here, we report the current knowledge about the sRNAs of these socioeconomically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput sRNA screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide sRNA identification and target prediction. Finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a novel tool to inactivate potential sRNA and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Cross-resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins A, and pleuromutilins due to the lsa(C) gene in Streptococcus agalactiae UCN70.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae UCN70, isolated from a vaginal swab obtained in New Zealand, is resistant to lincosamides and streptogramins A (LS(A) phenotype) and also to tiamulin (a pleuromutilin). By whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 5,224-bp chromosomal extra-element that comprised a 1,479-bp open reading frame coding for an ABC protein (492 amino acids) 45% identical to Lsa(A), a protein related to intrinsic LS(A) resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. Expression of this novel gene, named lsa(C), in S. agalactiae BM132 after cloning led to an increase in MICs of lincomycin (0.06 to 4 mug/ml), clindamycin (0.03 to 2 mug/ml), dalfopristin (2 to >32 mug/ml), and tiamulin (0.12 to 32 mug/ml), whereas no change in MICs of erythromycin (0.06 mug/ml), azithromycin (0.03 mug/ml), spiramycin (0.25 mug/ml), telithromycin (0.03 mug/ml), and quinupristin (8 mug/ml) was observed. The phenotype was renamed the LS(A)P phenotype on the basis of cross-resistance to lincosamides, streptogramins A, and pleuromutilins. This gene was also identified in similar genetic environments in 17 other S. agalactiae clinical isolates from New Zealand exhibiting the same LS(A)P phenotype, whereas it was absent in susceptible S. agalactiae strains. Interestingly, this extra-element was bracketed by a 7-bp duplication of a target site (ATTAGAA), suggesting that this structure was likely a mobile genetic element. In conclusion, we identified a novel gene, lsa(C), responsible for the acquired LS(A)P resistance phenotype in S. agalactiae. Dissection of the biochemical basis of resistance, as well as demonstration of in vitro mobilization of lsa(C), remains to be performed.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine as a root canal irrigant--antimicrobial and scanning electron microscopic evaluation].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selection of irrigant is very important for long-term success of root canal therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution (CHX) against five selected microorganisms and to evaluate its efficacy in root canal cleaning. METHODS: In this study, by agar diffusion test, were evaluated antimicrobial effects of three root canal irrigants: 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX. The microorganisms tested in this study were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. A scanning electron microscope was used to evaluate root canal cleaning ability of 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, 2% CHX and 15% EDTA. Twelve extracted single-root human teeth were divided into four groups depending on the irrigant used during instrumentation. Mechanical preparation was performed with Step back technique and K files. Data were analysed statistically by Student's t-test. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was the most effective against all tested microorganisms. 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX showed antimicrobial effects against all tested microorganisms but zones of inhibition were smaller.The best results in root canal walls cleaning were obtained in the group where the irrigant was 15% EDTA (score 2.33). In 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX groups, there was more smear layer (score 4 and 5). CONCLUSION: 2% chlorhexidine digluconate showed strong antimicrobial effect on the tested microorganisms, but was not effective in cleaning root canal walls.
TI  - Resazurin metabolism assay for root canal disinfectant evaluation on dual-species biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endodontic infections are caused by polymicrobial biofilms. Therefore, novel root canal disinfectants should be evaluated not only on single-species biofilms but also on dual- or mixed-species biofilms. A simple, high-throughput assay is urgently needed for this. In this study, the application of the resazurin metabolism assay was investigated for the evaluation of a root canal disinfectant on dual-species biofilms. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis with or without Streptococcus mutans in biofilms were formed in an active attachment biofilm model for 24 hours. Subsequently, the biofilms were treated with various concentrations of NaOCl for 1 minute. After resazurin metabolism by both organisms was confirmed, treatment efficacies using 0.0016% resazurin were evaluated. RESULTS: During NaOCl treatments, resazurin metabolism displays a clear dose response, not only in single-species E. faecalis (or S. mutans) biofilms but also in dual-species biofilms. Notably, the assay revealed that the resistance of dual-species biofilms to NaOCl was 30-fold higher than in single-species E. faecalis biofilms. Viability counts on a selected NaOCl treatment (0.004%) confirmed this result and showed the increased resistance of E. faecalis in dual-species biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, the high-throughput and low cost resazurin metabolism assay has a great potential for testing novel root canal antimicrobial agents in mixed-species biofilms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the essential oil from Rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. The rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. The essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. In the present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil. Among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen S. mitis was the most susceptible and E. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.
TI  - Telavancin Activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - Telavancin is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms. The antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) Gram-positive bacteria responsible for SSSI in medical centers in Asia-Pacific, European, Latin American, and North American regions. Telavancin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all Enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a VanB phenotype, at </= 1 mg/L (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a VanA phenotype (MIC, >2 mg/l). Vancomycin-susceptible and VanB vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/L, while this drug exhibited elevated MIC values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against E. faecium of VanA phenotype (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). Telavancin was potent against beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). These in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary Gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the treatment of cSSSI caused by the indicated pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows optimization for YATP (cell mass produced per mole of ATP) at their physiological pHs.
AB  - Several lactic acid bacteria use homolactic acid fermentation for generation of ATP. Here we studied the role of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme on the general physiology of the three homolactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Of note, deletion of the ldh genes hardly affected the growth rate in chemically defined medium under microaerophilic conditions. However, the growth rate was affected in rich medium. Furthermore, deletion of ldh affected the ability for utilization of various substrates as a carbon source. A switch to mixed acid fermentation was observed during glucose-limited continuous growth and was dependent on the growth rate for S. pyogenes and on the pH for E. faecalis. In S. pyogenes and L. lactis, a change in pH resulted in a clear change in Y(ATP) (cell mass produced per mole of ATP). The pH that showed the highest Y(ATP) corresponded to the pH of the natural habitat of the organisms.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis secondary to spinal analgesia and anaesthesia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although rare, infectious complications from spinal analgesia and anaesthesia (SA) can have serious morbidity and mortality. This study describes the clinical features and outcome of SA-associated bacterial meningitis in adults seen in a hospital over a 25 yearperiod. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients (aged >/=14 years) diagnosed with SA-associated bacterial meningitis between 1982 and 2006. RESULTS: Eight cases of SA-associated bacterial meningitis were diagnosed (3.3% bacterial meningitis), with a median age of 62 years (range, 35-80). SA procedures were: morphine infusion pumps with epidural (3 cases) or intrathecal (3) catheters, spinal cord stimulation with epidural neuroelectrode (1), and epidural anesthesia (1). Site of spinal insertion was: cervical (2 cases), thoracic (3), and lumbar (3). The median time to onset of meningitis was 26 days (range, 7-101) after AE. The most common clinical findings were fever (8 cases, 100%), headache (7 cases, 87.5%), and neck stiffness (4 cases, 50%). CSF abnormalities were pleocytosis (8 cases, 100%), elevated protein level (8 cases, 100%), and hypoglycorrhachia (5 cases, 62.5%). The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), and S. epidermidis and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1); one patient had a negative CSF culture. Treatment included antibiotics and to remove the analgesia device in all patients. There was one death (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: SA is a rare predisposing condition to bacterial meningitis but, due to the seriousness of the infection, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops fever or headache in this setting.
TI  - [A clinical analysis of 25 cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical characteristics of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). METHODS: All 25 cases of definite PVE (Duke criteria) diagnosed at our hospital between January 1992 to December 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 7 cases were pathologically confirmed and the others were clinically confirmed with either 2 major criteria or 1 major and >/= 3 minor criteria. Their clinical characteristics, underlying heart diseases, previous heart operations, presenting manifestations, causative microbes, echocardiographic findings and prognosis, were studied. RESULTS: (1) Although most cases underwent valve transplantations for underlying heart diseases of rheumatic heart diseases and congenital heart diseases, 10 patients were complicated with infectious endocarditis (IE) prior to the operations, 4 of them were PVE. (2) Eleven of them developed PVE within 2 months postoperatively. Fever (100%), major vessel embolism (48%), and anemia (36%) were the most frequently manifestations. Fourteen cases (56%) had positive culture results with 15 causative pathogens, including 5 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS, 3 were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, MRSCoN), 4 fungi, 2 Enterococcus faecalis, 2 Burkholderia cepacia, 1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 1 Streptococcus. (3) Prosthetic valve vegetations, periannular leakage, regurgitation, were the main echocardiographic findings. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed 13 PVE who had no positive findings on previous transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). (4) Eighteen PVE (72%) developed peri-annular complications (12 leakage, 3 dehiscence, 2 abscesses, 1 fistula), major vessel embolism, congestive heart failure (16%) were frequently observed, 9 of the 17 patients died in hospital, in spite of intensive managements. CONCLUSIONS: PVE has a high mortality and is a severe complication for patients who underwent heart surgery. Its causative pathogen spectrum is quite different from that of native valve endocarditis. TTE is not sensitive for some PVE cases.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance associated with commensal bacteria from representative ready-to-consume deli and restaurant foods.
AB  - Proper knowledge of antibiotic resistance (AR) dissemination is essential for effective mitigation. This study examined the profiles of tetracycline-resistant (Tetr) commensal bacteria from representative ready-to-consume food samples from salad bars at local grocery stores and restaurants. Out of 900 Tetr isolates examined, 158 (17.6%) carried one or more of tetM, tetL, tetS, and tetK genes by conventional PCR, 28 harbored more than one Tetr determinants. The most prevalent genotype was tetM, which was detected in 70.9% of the AR gene carriers, followed by tetL (31.6%), tetS (13.9%), and tetK (2.5%). Identified AR gene carriers included Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Staphylococcus, Brochothrix, Carnobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, and Sphingobacterium, by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. AR determinants were successfully transmitted, and led to resistance in Streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation and Enterococcus faecalis via electroporation, suggesting the functionality and mobility of the AR genes from the food commensal bacteria. In addition, the AR traits in many isolates are quite stable, even in the absence of the selective pressure. The identification of new commensal carriers for representative AR genes revealed the involvement of a broad spectrum of bacteria in the horizontal transmission of AR genes. Meanwhile, the spectrum of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria differed from the spectrum of the total bacteria (by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) associated with the food items. Our data revealed a common avenue in AR exposure and will assist in proper risk assessment and the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies to effectively combat AR.
TI  - Late-onset deep infectious keratitis after descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty with vent incisions.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the clinical and histopathological findings of 3 cases of late-onset deep infectious keratitis after Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) with vent incisions. METHODS: From a retrospective review of 150 consecutive patients who underwent uncomplicated DSEK with vent incisions, 3 patients developed late-onset deep infectious keratitis. RESULTS: In case 1, the patient suffered a Pseudomonas corneal ulcer at the nasal vent incision after a dacryocystorhinostomy with stent, 16 months after DSEK. In case 2, a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection developed at the inferior vent incision from a spastic entropion 3 months after surgery. In case 3, an Enterococcus faecalis corneal ulcer presented as a deep stromal abscess in the nasal vent incision 7 weeks after DSEK. All cases required full-thickness penetrating keratoplasties. Visual acuities at the last follow-up were counting fingers (case 1), 20/80 (case 2), and 20/400 (case 3). CONCLUSIONS: Vent incisions in DSEK may allow bacterial keratitis to penetrate deeply leading to aggressive keratolysis. One must be cautious in using vent incisions in patients with increased bacterial flora and patients with poor ocular surface healing from systemic, local, or mechanical conditions. If vent incisions are performed, a midperipheral oblique incision, parallel to the limbus, with meticulous detail to wound construction is recommended.
TI  - Anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. Currently, the most promising candidates in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. Besides the anti-malarial activity, SP is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as IPTp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. METHODS: In this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. RESULTS: SP was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All tested Gram-positive bacteria, except Enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. Additionally, azithromycin was active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. CONCLUSION: These data indicate important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. Given the large scale use of IPTp in Africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite-based irrigating solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of three different NaOCl-based endodontic irrigating solutions: a 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution; and two new irrigating solutions, a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with the addition of a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant; and a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic irrigating solutions by the agar disc diffusion test. Paper disks were saturated with each one of the tested solutions (at room temperature and pre-warmed at 45 degrees C) and placed onto culture agar-plates pre-adsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The growth inhibition zones around each irrigating solution were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. RESULTS: The results were significantly different among the tested irrigating solutions: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution produced the highest inhibition areas; 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed the lowest zones of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Even if all tested irrigating solution possessed antibacterial activity versus all tested bacterial strains, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed lower in vitro efficacy than 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution.
TI  - Synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  - Maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. This study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for Staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for Streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for Enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin for Enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. A range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. The results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on S. aureus. Minimal concentrations and MBC of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. The MBC of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against S. aureus were also decreased. The other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. Excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. The synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.
TI  - Evidence of bacterial biofilms in nasal polyposis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pathogeny of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRS/NP) has not been elucidated. Bacterial exotoxins have been implicated in many inflammatory chronic diseases, such as chronic otitis, chronic tonsillitis, cholesteatomas, and more recently CRS/NP. We propose that the bacteria in CRS/NP are not only present in a planktonic state, but also occur in microbial communities as biofilms. OBJECTIVE: To determine and characterize the presence of biofilms in CRS/NP. METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 12 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for nasal polyposis. Ten patients without CRS/NP who underwent septoplasty were included as a control group. Tissue samples were obtained from the inferior turbinate mucosae. The bacteria were isolated and typified and the material was examined in vitro using a spectrophotometer, and in vivo using optical microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy. RESULTS: Moderate to high in vitro biofilm-forming capacity was detected in 9 out of 12 patients with CRS/NP (mean [SD] optical density values of between 0.284 [0.017] and 3.337 [0.029]). The microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus (5 patients), Streptococcus viridans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus viridans/Corynebacterium. Biofilms were demonstrated in vivo in 2 patients and no biofilm structures were evident in any of the controls. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the presence of bacterial biofilms in patients with CRS/NP. This chronic inflammatory factor might contribute to nasal mucosa damage, increased inflammatory cells in tissue, and the subsequent hyperplasic process.
TI  - Photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  - The relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of H(2)O(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. H(2)O(2) (1 M) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. Electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. Four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. S. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. Laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 M H(2)O(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. Treatment of S. mutans in a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. Other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. Treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 muM hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel C8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n=1), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, n=1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP, n=1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, n=2), Enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE) and Escherichia coli (n=3). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by PRSP (n=1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending urinary tract infection caused by E. coli (n=1). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA (ED(50) =2.08 mg/kg), MRSA (ED(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant MRSC (ED(50) =2.52 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) =5.47 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and E. coli (ED(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards E. faecalis infection (ED(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by Gram-positive isolates (MSSA, MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PISP, PRSP and E. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against E. coli infection (P<0.01). Nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with Gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ED(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the MIC data (4- to 16-fold MIC advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards PRSP (higher than levofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. In the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against E. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. The higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by Gram-positive cocci (especially MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PRSP and VRE) warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to antibiotics in patients with symptomatic apical periodontitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate susceptibility of predominant endodontic pathogens isolated from teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis to most commonly prescribed antibiotics. METHODS: Among 58 patients with symptomatic apical periodontitis, 47 and 11 cases were caused by primary and secondary root canal infection, respectively. The microbial samples were taken either from the root canals (35 cases) or by aspiration from apical abscesses (23 cases). Culture methods were used to identify the microorganisms present in the samples. Antibiotic susceptibilities of all isolates were evaluated by using the E-test method. RESULTS: Microorganisms were isolated from 49 of the 58 samples studied and included facultative and obligate anaerobes. Streptococci and obligate anaerobes were the predominant microorganisms in cases of primary infection. Enterococcus faecalis dominated in cases of secondary infection. All tested microorganisms were highly sensitive to penicillin G, amoxicillin, and ampicillin. Susceptibilities to clindamycin and erythromycin were 73.8% and 54.7%, respectively. About 40% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline. More than 50% of all anaerobes were resistant to metronidazole. All E. faecalis isolates were resistant to clindamycin. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the study results, penicillin and amoxicillin are suitable antibiotics for treatment of endodontic infection when conventional root canal treatment alone is insufficient. Clindamycin could be advised for penicillin-allergic patients with primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Detection of selected bacterial species in intraoral sites of patients with chronic periodontitis using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence of selected bacterial species in intraoral sites of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, supragingival and subgingival plaque and saliva of 30 patients with untreated CP. Multiplex PCR was used to determine prevalence rates, which were then compared using a chi-square test. Significance level was set at p<0.05. Mean and standard deviation values were used to evaluate variations in prevalence according to site. RESULTS: The prevalence of S. mutans was 70% in saliva; 60% in samples collected from the tongue dorsum; 50% in samples collected from the buccal mucosa; 56.5% in the supragingival plaque; and 53.5% in the subgingival plaque. The prevalence of E. faecalis ranged from 3.5% to 13.5% in all intraoral microenvironment. The highest prevalence of P. gingivalis was found in subgingival plaque (53.5%), and of P. intermedia in supragingival plaque (33.5%), subgingival plaque (30%) and tongue dorsum (33.5%). The prevalence of bacteria did not vary significantly among the intraoral sites. CONCLUSIONS: All studied bacteria were identified in intraoral sites. S. mutans, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia had high prevalence rates, but the prevalence of E. faecalis was low. Multiplex PCR proved to be an adequate method for epidemiological studies.
TI  - Photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in selected polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) preparations. Studies on curcumin and curcuminoids, XLI.
AB  - Curcumin, bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione, is a yellow-orange pigment which can be synthesised chemically or isolated from the plant Curcuma longa L. Curcumin has a rather broad absorption peak in the range 300-500 nm (maximum approximately 430 nm) and has potential as a photosensitiser for treatment of localised superficial infections in e.g., the mouth or skin. Previously, we have demonstrated phototoxic effects of curcumin in selected aqueous preparations against both gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus intermedius and gram-negative Escherichia coil bacteria in vitro. One of the most efficient preparations was curcumin in polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.1. In this study the solubilising effect of PEG 400 on curcumin molecules and the in vitro phototoxic effects of these preparations were further evaluated. The effect of varying the curcumin concentration (2.50 microM -25.00 microM), the radiant exposure (0.5-30 J/cm2) and the physical state of curcumin against the survival of E. coli was investigated. PEG 400 showed an increasing physically stabilising effect towards crystallisation of curcumin in aqueous preparation with increasing concentrations (2.5%-10.0% v/v). Despite a higher solubility of curcumin with increasing PEG 400 concentrations, the surfactant reduced the phototoxicity of curcumin against E. coil. The highest phototoxic effect was obtained when curcumin was present in the least physically stable preparation, a stock solution in ethanol added to PBS with or without the lowest test concentration of PEG 400 (2.5% v/v). The obtained phototoxic effect can be increased by increasing the irradiation dose or by choosing an optimal curcumin concentration. E. faecalis was efficiently killed by the lowest concentration of curcumin in combination with the lowest radiant exposure when curcumin was dissolved in certain PEG solutions (< 0.02% survival), but showed no reduction when exposed to preirradiated curcumin.
TI  - Novel plasmid-based genetic tools for the study of promoters and terminators in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Promoter-probe and terminator-probe plasmid vectors make possible to rapidly examine whether particular sequences function as promoter or terminator signals in various genetic backgrounds and under diverse environmental stimuli. At present, such plasmid-based genetic tools are very scarce in the Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Hence, we developed novel promoter-probe and terminator-probe vectors based on the Streptococcus agalactiae pMV158 plasmid, which replicates autonomously in numerous Gram-positive bacteria. As reporter gene, a gfp allele encoding a variant of the green fluorescent protein was used. These genetic tools were shown to be suitable to assess the activity of promoters and terminators (both homologous and heterologous) in S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis. In addition, the promoter-probe vector was shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of regulated promoters in vivo, such as the promoter of the pneumococcal fuculose kinase gene. These new plasmid vectors will be very useful for the experimental verification of predicted promoter and terminator sequences, as well as for the construction of new inducible-expression vectors. Given the promiscuity exhibited by the pMV158 replicon, these vectors could be used in a variety of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Total synthesis and antibiotic activity of dehydrohomoplatencin.

TI  - Phenotyping and genotyping of streptococci in bovine milk in Argentinean dairy herds.
AB  - Most veterinary and milk hygiene laboratories identify streptococci and enterococci based on serological and biochemical tests. The analysis of 16S rDNA was suggested to be used for more exact identification; however, its use has not been considered so far in monitoring studies. The objective of the present study was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA (16S rDNA RFLP) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (IMI) in six Argentinean dairy farms. Composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. Twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the API 20 Strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16S rDNA RFLP in a blind assay. The remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16S rDNA RFLP and conventional biochemical tests. As indicated by Kappa values, agreement between the 16S rDNA RFLP and the conventional scheme for identification of Streptococcus agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis, S. equinus and Enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. Together with the less frequently isolated streptococcal species, the conventional scheme correctly identified 77 out of 90 isolates (85.5%). Thus, the use of 16S rDNA RFLP is considered valuable for monitoring studies due to its affordable cost for standard laboratories.
TI  - Biological activity of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata (Schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. METHODS: The essential oil from stem bark of Kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GLC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC/MS). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. Inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MIA PaCa-2, HeLa, HL-60, MDA-MB-231 and SW-480) was examined using the MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-Cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. The oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 microg/ml oil. The essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but it did not show any activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in Trypanosoma b. brucei with an IC50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. Radical scavenging activity had an IC50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-Lipoxygenase inhibition (IC50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin E(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. The oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against MIA PaCa-2, HepG-2 and SW-480 cell lines with IC50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. The oil increased caspase 3/7 activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in MIA Paca-2 cells. Camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. However, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, K. longipedunculata, a traditionally used Chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of crude EtOH/H2O extracts from the leaves and stems of Rosmarinus officinalis L. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined with the broth microdilution method. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by HPLC analysis. Rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. HPLC Analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. The results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of R. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.
TI  - Worldwide summary of telavancin spectrum and potency against Gram-positive pathogens: 2007 to 2008 surveillance results.
AB  - Telavancin was approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible Gram-positive isolates. In this study, telavancin and comparator antimicrobial activities were determined against a total of 24,017 clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS), Enterococcus spp., and various Streptococcus spp. Overall, telavancin was highly active across all geographic regions for S. aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(50/90), < or =0.015/0.03 microg/mL), viridans group Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.12 microg/mL; 99.8% susceptible). Telavancin had potent activity against vancomycin-nonsusceptible, teicoplanin-susceptible (VanB) E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 microg/mL). These in vitro results show continued activity for telavancin, which represents an important alternative available for treating cSSSI.
TI  - Prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in central part of Croatia.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of SBP. This prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of SBP: SBP group (n=23) and non-SBP group (n=85). Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. The pathogens responsible for SBP were analyzed in SBP group. The prevalence of SBP was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. Statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; P=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; P=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; P=0.05). The incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5% vs. 50%; P=0.892). The following pathogens were responsible for SBP: Escherichia coli (n=7), MRSA (n=2), Acinetobacter spp. (n=2), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1), Streptococcus spp. (n=1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). As indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of SBP were high. Patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven SBP. The pathogens responsible for SBP were mostly gram-negative microorganisms; however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - Effects of myrcia ovata cambess. Essential oil on planktonic growth of gastrointestinal microorganisms and biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Myrcia ovata Cambess., commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric illnesses, was screened for antimicrobial activity and action in the formation of microbial biofilms by Enterococcus faecalis. The oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a clevenger-type system. Its chemical composition was analyzed using GC and GC-MS. Both MIC and MBC of the essential oil were determined by broth microdilution techniques and agar dilution method. The essential oil showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed that the essential oil of M. ovata Cambess. was effective against the formation of biofilm by E. faecalis when compared with the control. Four volatile compounds, representing 92.1 % of the oil, were identified and geranial was the major component (50.4 %). At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from leaves of M. ovata.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of polyethyleneimine nanoparticles incorporated in provisional cements against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequently provisional restorations require long-term permanence in the oral cavity, thus an antibacterial effect is desirable. We hypothesized that this effect may be achieved by incorporating polyethyleneimine (PEI) nanoparticles into provisional cements. METHODS: The nanoparticles antibacterial effect incorporated at 0.5%, 1%, and 2% w/w into provisional cement, was studied in vitro. The antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis was tested using direct contact test. The data was analyzed using the ANOVA test, with the Dunnett test for multiple pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: A strong antibacterial effect was evident in all test groups after an aging period of 14 days against S. mutans and E. faecalis (p < 0.05). A significant effect was found between study groups 0.5% w/w and 1% w/w group, as well as between study groups 0.5% w/w and 2% w/w for E. faecalis (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found between study groups 1% w/w and 2% w/w. The growth rate graphs depict an effective bacteria inhibition starting from 1% w/w. CONCLUSION: PEI nanoparticles incorporated at low concentrations in a provisional cement exhibit antibacterial effect against S. mutans and E. faecalis for a period of 14 days. The minimum effective concentration suggested is 1% w/w. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Incorporation of nanoparticles may prevent caries and inflammation, and thereby improve the results of the prosthetic treatment. Further investigation is necessary on the effect on mechanical properties and clinical relevance.
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Usefulness and limit of Gram staining smear examination].
AB  - Gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. It yields results much faster than culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. However, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by Gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. Therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from Gram staining smears is also present. The Gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. Species of Gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. Gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. Even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive diplococcus, forming Gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling Streptococcus pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in the sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Capnocytophaga sp. is a Gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - Observations on the incidence and aetiology of valvular endocarditis in broiler breeders and detection of a newly described taxon of Pasteurellaceae, Avibacterium endocarditidis.
AB  - A total of 122 dead broiler breeders randomly selected from a flock showing normal production parameters and covering the age from 44 to 61 weeks were subjected to a comprehensive routine post-mortem examination including examination for lesions of endocarditis. Forty-two hens (34%) showed valvular endocarditis caused by Avibacterium endocarditidis (43%), Enterococcus faecalis (31%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%) and Streptococcus pluranimalium (5%), while growth was not obtained from 17% with the methods used for isolation. Gross lesions associated with the different bacterial pathogens did not allow separation according to pathogens involved. Port of entry and pathogenesis associated with the high prevalence of valvular endocarditis remained speculative. The present findings demonstrated the newly described species of Pasteurellaceae, Avibacterium endocarditidis associated with endocarditis in chickens and confirm previous observations on the prevalence of endocarditis in chickens, partly explaining the slightly increased mortality normally observed in broiler breeders during the last weeks of production.
TI  - Chlorhexidine release and antibacterial properties of chlorhexidine-incorporated  polymethyl methacrylate-based resin cement.
AB  - This study evaluated chlorhexidine release from experimental, chlorhexidine-incorporated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based resin cements prepared from Super-Bond C&B (Sun Medical) and examined the antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis. Chlorhexidine diacetate was added into PMMA polymer to obtain chlorhexidine concentration of 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 wt %. Chlorhexidine-incorporated, cured resin disks were immersed in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 5 weeks, and the chlorhexidine release was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibacterial effect of freshly mixed resin cements was examined using the agar diffusion test. For the direct contact test, the wells (n = 6) of microtiter plates were coated with cements. The coated wells were aged up to 3 weeks prior to the placement of bacterial suspensions directly on cured cements. The 3.0 and 4.0% chlorhexidine-incorporated cement exhibited chlorhexidine release for 5 weeks; however, more than 98% of chlorhexidine was retained in resin matrix. No release was detected from the 1.0 and 2.0% incorporated cement at 1 week and 2 weeks, respectively. The agar diffusion test failed to detect antibacterial effects against Enterococcus faecalis, whereas the direct contact test revealed the antibacterial effect of 3.0 and 4.0% incorporated cements against each microbe for 2 weeks. The 3.0 and 4.0% chlorhexidine-incorporated resin cement possessed prolonged chlorhexidine release and antibacterial properties for 2 weeks.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the tet (M)-carrying conjugative transposon Tn5251 of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Tn916-like genetic element Tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (CTn) Tn5253 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called Omega(cat-tet) BM6001. DNA sequence analysis showed that Tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 ORFs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. Annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 ORFs, including the tet(M) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. Autonomous copies of Tn5251 were generated during matings of Tn5253-containing donors with S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. It behaves as a fully functional CTn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. The excision of Tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion in Tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to the expression of the mecA gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. For macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins B, (MLS(B)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vanA isolates). In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to MLS(B) in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parC/parE (low level) and in gyrA. It is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in Spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vanA enterococci and case reports due to vanB2 enterococci have been recently reported.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for bifidobacteria and nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In a small-scale harmonization study involving nine laboratories in eight European countries, the intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercially available systems, i.e., the VetMIC microplate system and Etest, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria (NELAB) and bifidobacteria were analyzed. In addition, one laboratory also performed standard broth microdilution as a reference method. MICs of tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and streptomycin for the type strains of 25 species of NELAB and bifidobacteria and MICs of vancomycin for a selection of relevant taxa were determined. The previously described lactic acid bacterium susceptibility test medium (LSM) and related mixed-medium formulations, all including Iso-Sensitest broth as a basic component, were used as test media. The overall agreement of median MIC ranges +/- 1 log(2) dilution determined by the VetMIC and Etest methods with the median MICs determined by the reference method was very good for tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin (92.3 to 100%) but low for erythromycin (19.5 to 30.7%) and clindamycin (50.0 to 80.8%). There was a consensus among the participating laboratories that VetMIC was preferred over Etest because of its lower cost, better growth support, and more uniform criteria for MIC end point reading. With the range for acceptable intralaboratory reproducibility being defined as the median MIC +/- 1 log(2) dilution, VetMIC results (with 69.2% of all data sets in the acceptable range) were shown to display greater reproducibility than Etest results (with 58.8% of all data sets in the acceptable range). Also at the interlaboratory level, the proportion of MIC values obtained with VetMIC that belonged to the complete agreement category (60.0%) was higher than the proportion of such values obtained with Etest (47.0%), which indicates a higher degree of interlaboratory reproducibility for the former method. Apart from some agent-specific effects, the majority of VetMIC and Etest replicate data sets were situated within a 1- to 2-log(2) dilution range, suggesting that the two methods can be considered to be equivalent for recognizing resistance phenotypes. This multicenter study has further validated the standard use of LSM and related mixed-medium formulations with commercially available systems and formed the basis for the ongoing development of the ISO 10932/IDF 223 standard for susceptibility testing of NELAB and bifidobacteria.
TI  - Endodontic photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source: an in vitro and ex vivo study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (PAD) using toluidine blue and an LED lamp was tested on endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and after inoculation into extracted teeth. Irradiation time was limited to 30 seconds. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of PAD on planktonic suspensions of Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedius was analyzed using Poisson regression. Moreover, cultures of S. intermedius were inoculated into prepared root canals of extracted molars. The effect of PAD performed immediately after inoculation or after overnight bacterial incubation was determined by a 2-sample t test. RESULTS: Photoactivated disinfection yielded significant reductions (P < .001) in the viable counts of all organisms in planktonic suspension. The PAD treatment of S. intermedius in root canals yielded a mean log10 reduction of 2.60 (P < .001) immediately after inoculation and of 1.38 (P < .001) after overnight incubation. CONCLUSION: Photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source strongly reduces the number of viable endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and in root canals.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine incorporation into a self-etching primer on dentine bond  strength of a luting cement.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of incorporating chlorhexidine in  a self-etching primer on the bond strength of an adhesive resin cement to dentine and on antibacterial activity. METHODS: Experimental self-etching primers were prepared by adding chlorhexidine (CHX) diacetate to ED primer 2.0 (Kuraray Medical Inc.) to obtain chlorhexidine concentrations of 1.0 wt% and 2.0 wt%. Human occlusal dentine surfaces were conditioned for 30 s using the experimental primers or pure ED primer. Composite blocks were luted using Panavia F 2.0 (Kuraray Medical Inc.). After storage in water for 24 h, the bonded teeth were sectioned into 0.9 mm x 0.9 mm beams and stressed to failure in tension to examine microtensile bond strength (microTBS). Fractured surfaces were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The morphology of dentine surfaces that were conditioned with each primer was also observed under FE-SEM. An agar diffusion test was performed to examine the antibacterial effect of each primer against Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: Addition of chlorhexidine to the primer had significant effects (p<0.001) on microTBS and antibacterial effect. No significant difference in microTBS was found between the groups that contained 0% and 1% chlorhexidine in the primer (p=0.095). Conversely, the group that contained 2% chlorhexidine showed significantly lower microTBS and pronounced cohesive failures within the thin layer of the primer. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of chlorhexidine into ED primer 2.0 showed significant antibacterial activities. Conditioning with the 1% chlorhexidine-containing primer had no adverse effect on microTBS.
TI  - A genetic determinant in Streptococcus gordonii Challis encodes a peptide with activity similar to that of enterococcal sex pheromone cAM373, which facilitates intergeneric DNA transfer.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis strains secrete multiple peptides representing different sex pheromones that induce mating responses by bacteria carrying specific conjugative plasmids. The pheromone cAM373, which induces a response by the enterococcal plasmid pAM373, has been of interest because a similar activity is also secreted by Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus. The potential to facilitate intergeneric DNA transfer from E. faecalis is of concern because of extensive multiple antibiotic resistance, including vancomycin resistance, that has emerged among enterococci in recent years. Here, we characterize the related pheromone determinant in S. gordonii and show that the peptide it encodes, gordonii-cAM373, does indeed induce transfer of plasmid DNA from E. faecalis into S. gordonii. The streptococcal determinant camG encodes a lipoprotein with a leader sequence, the last 7 residues of which represent the gordonii-cAM373 heptapeptide SVFILAA. Synthetic forms of the peptide had activity similar to that of the enterococcal cAM373 AIFILAS. The lipoprotein moiety bore no resemblance to the lipoprotein encoded by E. faecalis. We also identified determinants in S. gordonii encoding a signal peptidase and an Eep-like zinc metalloprotease (lspA and eep, respectively) similar to those involved in processing certain pheromone precursors in E. faecalis. Mutations generated in camG, lspA, and eep each resulted in the ablation of gordonii-cAM373 activity in culture supernatants. This is the first genetic analysis of a potential sex pheromone system in a commensal oral streptococcal species, which may have implications for intergeneric gene acquisition in oral biofilms.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.

AB  
TI  - Abundance of type I toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria: searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.
AB  - Small, hydrophobic proteins whose synthesis is repressed by small RNAs (sRNAs), denoted type I toxin-antitoxin modules, were first discovered on plasmids where they regulate plasmid stability, but were subsequently found on a few bacterial chromosomes. We used exhaustive PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN searches across 774 bacterial genomes to identify homologs of known type I toxins. These searches substantially expanded the collection of predicted type I toxins, revealed homology of the Ldr and Fst toxins, and suggested that type I toxin-antitoxin loci are not spread by horizontal gene transfer. To discover novel type I toxin-antitoxin systems, we developed a set of search parameters based on characteristics of known loci including the presence of tandem repeats and clusters of charged and bulky amino acids at the C-termini of short proteins containing predicted transmembrane regions. We detected sRNAs for three predicted toxins from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and showed that two of the respective proteins indeed are toxic when overexpressed. We also demonstrated that the local free-energy minima of RNA folding can be used to detect the positions of the sRNA genes. Our results suggest that type I toxin-antitoxin modules are much more widely distributed among bacteria than previously appreciated.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Identification of tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci within the fermenting microflora of an Italian dairy food product.
AB  - AIMS: Microbiological and molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive cocci derived from the Italian PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) dairy food product Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and seven coccal colonies were assigned to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus bovis genera by ARDRA analysis (amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis). Among them, 16 Ent. faecalis, 26 L. lactis and 39 Strep. bovis displayed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for tetracycline, while 17 L. lactis showed high MIC values for both tetracycline and erythromycin. Strain typing and molecular analysis of the phenotypically resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of the tet(M) gene in the tetracycline-resistant strains and of tet(S) and erm(B) in the double-resistant strains. Southern blot analysis revealed plasmid localization of L. lactis tet(M), as well as of the erm(B) and tet(S) genes. Genetic linkage of erm(B) and tet(S) was also demonstrated by PCR amplification. Conjugation experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer to Ent. faecalis strain JH2-2 only for the plasmid-borne L. lactis tet(M) gene. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized tetracycline-and erythromycin-resistance genes in coccal species, representing the fermenting microflora of a typical Italian dairy product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results are of particular relevance from the food safety viewpoint, especially in the light of the potential risk of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes among foodborne commensal bacteria.
TI  - Antineoplastic agents. 573. isolation and structure of papilistatin from the papilionid butterfly Byasa polyeuctes termessa.
AB  - Bioassay-guided separation of an extract of the wings from a Taiwan butterfly, Byasa polyeuctes termessa, allowed isolation of a new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated papilistatin (1a). The structure was determined by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra and by HRMS. Against a panel of six human and the murine P388 leukemia cancer cell lines, papilistatin exhibited cancer cell growth inhibition with GI(50)'s of 0.093-3.5 microg/mL. Papilistatin was also found to have antibacterial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, Sealapex and EndoREZ.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE), Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (Calen/ZO), Sealapex sealer and EndoREZ sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (Kocuria rhizophila, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). Calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and distilled water served as controls. Seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with the test and control materials. After incubation of the plates at 37 degrees C for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). There were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. K. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, while Calen/ZO had its highest antibacterial activity against E. faecalis (p<0.05). S. mutans was inhibited by Calen/ZO, Sealapex and ZOE in the same intensity (p>0.05). E. coli was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, followed by Calen/ZO and Sealapex. Calen/ZO and ZOE were equally effective (p>0.05) against S. aureus, while Sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. EndoREZ presented antibacterial activity only against K. rhizophila and S. aureus. The Calen paste and Calen/ZO produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% CHX when the marker microorganism was E faecalis. In conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: ZOE>Calen/ZO>Sealapex>EndoREZ.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
AB  - 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against S. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615. (Z)-5-(2,3,4-Trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 0.5 microg/mL and MRSA at 32 microg/mL. Stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. Neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Infective Endocarditis: Identification of Catalase-Negative, Gram-Positive Cocci  from Blood Cultures by Partial 16S rRNA Gene Analysis and by Vitek 2 Examination.
AB  - Streptococci, enterococci and Streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. Viridans streptococci (VS) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. Vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. STRAINS ORIGINATED FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. Of the 330 strains, based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were VS strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were E. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci. Among VS strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same VS group. Non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.Only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. Most VS strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Pyogenic strains (n=10), Enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of 4-META/MMA-TBB resin containing chlorhexidine.
AB  - This study evaluated the antibacterial effects of 4-acryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tri-n-butylborane (4-META/MMA-TBB) resin containing chlorhexidine (CHX) digluconate. The CHX was incorporated into the resins at varying concentrations from 0.0 (control) to 3.0%. The antibacterial effect of each resin against seven microorganisms was examined using agar diffusion tests. Growth inhibition of two streptococci was also tested in brain heart infusion (BHI) liquid broth containing each resin. Release of CHX was analyzed using HPLC, and enamel and dentin bond strengths of each resin were measured. In the agar diffusion tests, growth of all the microorganisms was inhibited by the resin specimens containing CHX at 1.0% or higher except for Enterococcus faecalis. There was greater sensitivity in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus than in the other bacteria tested. Complete growth inhibition of these two streptococci was observed in BHI liquid broth containing 1.0-1.5% or greater CHX-incorporated resin. According to HPLC analysis, 1.0% and 1.5% CHX-containing resins released means of 3.63 and 8.59 microg/mL of CHX, respectively. Specimens with 0.5-1.5% and 0.5-2.0% CHX exhibited no significant reduction in enamel and dentin bond strengths, respectively, when compared to the control (p > 0.05). This in vitro study suggested that incorporation of 1.0-1.5% CHX digluconate into the 4-META resin is optimal in terms of antibacterial effects and bond strength to the tooth.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - The effects of antimicrobials on endodontic biofilm bacteria.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the present study, confocal microscopy, a miniflow cell system,  and image analysis were combined to test in situ the effect of antimicrobials and alkali on biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus gordonii isolated from root canals with persistent infections. METHODS: Biofilms formed for 24 hours were exposed for 5 minutes to alkali (pH = 12), chlorhexidine digluconate (2.5%), EDTA (50 mmol/L), and sodium hypochlorite (1%). The biofilms were then characterized by using fluorescent markers targeting cell membrane integrity (LIVE/DEAD) and metabolic activity (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride and fluorescein diacetate). In addition, the biofilm architecture and the extent to which coating of the substrate surface with collagen influenced the resistance pattern to the chemicals were also analyzed. RESULTS: NaOCl (1%) affected the membrane integrity of all organisms and removed most biofilm cells. Exposure to EDTA (50 mmol/L) affected the membrane integrity in all organisms but failed to remove more than a few cells in biofilms of E. faecalis, L. paracasei, and S. anginosus. Chlorhexidine (2.5%) had a mild effect on the membrane integrity of E. faecalis and removed only 50% of its biofilm cells The effects were substratum-dependent, and most organisms displayed increased resistance to the antimicrobials on collagen-coated surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The biofilm system developed here was sensitive and differences in cell membrane integrity and removal of biofilm cells after exposure to antimicrobials commonly used in endodontics was discernible.
TI  - [Problem of infections at ENT Department of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections at ENT wards constitute an essential clinical, organizational and economic issue. AIM: The purpose of this work was to present the problem of infections at ENT Clinic of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2006-2007 in The Department of Otolaryngology in Poznan there were treated 7052 patients. During that time 476 biological samples were taken to carry out a bacteriological examination. They came from: 74 postoperative wounds, 43 tracheotomy areas, 29 tracheoesophageal fistulas, 9 salivary fistulas, 105 ears, 71 noses, pharynxes and oral cavities, 44 body fluids, 18 paranasal sinuses, 11 central venous catheter areas, 23 urine samples, some constituted BAL, sputum, cyst content, materials from decubitus ulcer and gastrostomies areas. 21 materials were taken from abscesses and phlegmons, 32 from patients with purulent complications of chronic otitis media, 18 from patients with complications of chronic sinusitis and in 1 case there was taken in hospital conditions peritonsillar abscess content. RESULTS: 119 biological samples were aseptic, in 43 samples there were no pathological cultures, in 314 samples pathological bacterial flora was found. The most often isolated pathogens constituted: in postoperative wounds-Staphylococcus epidermidis, in tracheotomy areas-Enterococcus faecalis, in tracheoesophagal fistulas-Streptococcus viridans, in ears-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in materials from noses, pharynxes and oral cavities-Staphylococcus aureus, while in materials from abscesses, paranasal sinuses and central venous catheter areas-Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: All cases were analyzed in detail. There was made a correlation between isolated pathogens and: a kind of pathology, surgical procedure, general patient condition, length of hospitalization.
TI  - Photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in different aqueous preparations. Studies on curcumin and curcuminoids XXXVII.
AB  - Curcumin has potential as a photosensitiser (PS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localised superficial infections. However, it is a challenge to make an optimal curcumin formulation in which curcumin has acceptable solubility and stability at physiological pH and combined with high selective phototoxic activity towards bacteria. In the present study, the phototoxic effects of curcumin against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated in selected aqueous preparations. The gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus intermedius and the gram-negative Escherichia coli were used as bacterial models. The bacteria were exposed to 1-25 microM curcumin solubilised in DMSO, cyclodextrines, liposomes and surfactants known to interfere with membranes. After 30 min incubation the bacteria were irradiated with fluorescent tubes emitting blue light (emission max 430 nm). The irradiance was 17 mW/cm2 and the radiant exposure (light dose) was 0.5-30J/cm2. The bacterial survival was calculated as a percentage compared to controls. Various post-irradiation incubation times were tested. Curcumin's native fluorescence was exploited in examination of curcumin uptake in or adherence to bacteria by fluorescence microscopy. Changes in post-irradiation incubation time, curcumin concentration, irradiation dose and preparation strongly influenced the phototoxic efficiency of curcumin in vitro. Aqueous preparations of DMSO, polyethyleneglycol and the pluronic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) were the most efficient vehicles for curcumin to exert photokilling of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  - An algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. The approach was based on a two-step procedure. The first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. The second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below which a specific investigation is required. The algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in Lyon, France. The first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. The modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. Setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (Acinetobacter baumannii) to 294 days (Enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for A. baumannii) except for E. cloacae (52.1%). Setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for A. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and 25% for Enterobacter cloacae. The threshold values then ranged from 8 days (S. pneumoniae) to 67 days (Streptococcus pyogenes). The approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.
TI  - Technology-induced selection towards the spoilage microbiota of artisan-type cooked ham packed under modified atmosphere.
AB  - The microbiota associated with a highly-perishable Belgian artisan-type cooked ham was analyzed through plating and (GTG)(5)-fingerprinting of isolates throughout its processing chain. The raw tumbled meat was characterized by the presence of a versatile microbiota around 4.8 log(cfu g(-1)), consisting of lactic acid bacteria, staphylococci, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. Pasteurisation of the ham logs reduced bacterial counts below 2 log(cfu g(-1)) and subsequent manipulations selected for leuconostocs and carnobacteria. Also, B. thermosphacta and several Enterobacteriaceae were found at this stage. During storage in an intermediate high-care area for 2 days, a selection towards certain Enterobacteriaceae (Hafnia alvei, Enterobacter spp., and Pantoea agglomerans) and lactic acid bacteria (mainly vagococci and Streptococcus parauberis) was observed. B. thermosphacta, Leuconostoc carnosum and carnobacteria were also detected, but only after allowing bacterial outgrowth by incubating the meat logs at 7 degrees C for four weeks. After a mild post-pasteurisation process and subsequent handling, incubation of the meat logs at 7 degrees C for four weeks led to outgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp.). B. thermosphacta, and lactic acid bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Leuc. carnosum, and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum) were also found. After slicing and packaging under modified atmosphere, the microbiota of the refrigerated end-product consisted of leuconostocs, carnobacteria, and B. thermosphacta.
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  - The seventh year of the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against Gram-positive pathogens in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.
TI  - Selective inhibitors of bacterial phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase.
AB  - Bacterial phosphopantothenolycysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the formation of phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) from (R)-phosphopantothenate, l-cysteine, and cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) and has been shown to be essential for growth and survival. The reaction proceeds through a phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate, mixed anhydride intermediate. Both structural and kinetic characterization studies on PPCS have shown differences in the nucleobase binding site between the bacterial and human enzyme. We report for the first time the design and synthesis of mimics of the phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate, which proved to be potent inhibitors of PPCS. These compounds were evaluated in vitro against PPCS from human and several species of bacteria and showed marked selectivity (up to 1000-fold) toward the bacterial enzymes. A phosphodiester intermediate mimic was the most potent of the compounds synthesized and displayed slow-onset, tight-binding kinetics toward E. faecalis PPCS.
TI  - Requirement of the Lactobacillus casei MaeKR two-component system for L-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei can metabolize L-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [MLF]) or malic enzyme (ME). Whereas utilization of L-malic acid via MLF does not support growth, the ME pathway enables L. casei to grow on L-malic acid. In this work, we have identified in the genomes of L. casei strains BL23 and ATCC 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maePE and maeKR, encoding a putative malate transporter (maeP), an ME (maeE), and a two-component (TC) system belonging to the citrate family (maeK and maeR). Homologous clusters were identified in Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Our results show that ME is essential for L-malic acid utilization in L. casei. Furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the TC system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on L-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate TC system regulates and is essential for the expression of ME. Transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maeE is induced in the presence of L-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas TC system expression was induced by L-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that MaeR binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-TTATT(A/T)AA-3'] in the mae promoter region. The location of the repeats strongly suggests that MaeR activates the expression of the diverging operons maePE and maeKR where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel non-fluorinated quinolone,  against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes in Taiwan.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activities of nemonoxacin against Gram-positive cocci with various resistance phenotypes. METHODS: MICs of nemonoxacin were determined for 798 recently collected (2005-07) and non-duplicate isolates of Gram-positive cocci by the agar dilution method. These isolates included: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 100); methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including ciprofloxacin-susceptible (n = 50), ciprofloxacin-resistant (n = 100), vancomycin-intermediate (n = 50) and daptomycin-non-susceptible (DNS-MRSA; n = 5) isolates, and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA; n = 101); invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 150); levofloxacin-non-susceptible (MICs of 4-64 mg/L) S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 30); and enterococci (n = 212), including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; n = 112). RESULTS: Nemonoxacin had potent activity against MSSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L), ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L) and CA-MRSA (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L). For all invasive S. pneumoniae isolates, the activity of nemonoxacin (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L) was similar to that of gemifloxacin and much better than that of levofloxacin (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L) and moxifloxacin (MIC(90) of 0.25 mg/L). Nemonoxacin had a 32- to 64-fold higher activity than levofloxacin against levofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates. Nemonoxacin exerted limited activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-intermediate MRSA (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L), DNS-MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis and 4 mg/L for Enterococcus faecium) and VRE (MIC(90) of 4 mg/L for E. faecalis and 16 mg/L for E. faecium). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a potentially useful role for nemonoxacin in the treatment of infections caused by MSSA, ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA and S. pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic fire ant venom: the solenopsins and isosolenopsins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin A, (2R, 6R)-solenopsin A, (2S, 6S)-solenopsin B, (+/-)-isosolenopsin A, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin A,(2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin A, (+/-)-isosolenopsin B, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin B, and (2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin B against 6 species of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Time kill studies used American Type Culture Collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: None of the venom alkaloids inhibited E. coli or P. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae. Only 4 alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. maltophilia. Time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: Specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - The amidase domain of lipoamidase specifically inactivates lipoylated proteins in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the 1950s, Reed and coworkers discovered an enzyme activity in Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis) extracts that inactivated the Escherichia. coli and E. faecalis pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes through cleavage of the lipoamide bond. The enzyme that caused this lipoamidase activity remained unidentified until Jiang and Cronan discovered the gene encoding lipoamidase (Lpa) through the screening of an expression library. Subsequent cloning and characterization of the recombinant enzyme revealed that lipoamidase is an 80 kDa protein composed of an amidase domain containing a classic Ser-Ser-Lys catalytic triad and a carboxy-terminal domain of unknown function. Here, we show that the amidase domain can be used as an in vivo probe which specifically inactivates lipoylated enzymes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated whether Lpa could function as an inducible probe of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation using E. coli as a model system. Lpa expression resulted in cleavage of lipoic acid from the three lipoylated proteins expressed in E. coli, but did not result in cleavage of biotin from the sole biotinylated protein, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. When expressed in lipoylation deficient E. coli, Lpa is not toxic, indicating that Lpa does not interfere with any other critical metabolic pathways. When truncated to the amidase domain, Lpa retained lipoamidase activity without acquiring biotinidase activity, indicating that the carboxy-terminal domain is not essential for substrate recognition or function. Substitution of any of the three catalytic triad amino acids with alanine produced inactive Lpa proteins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The enzyme lipoamidase is active against a broad range of lipoylated proteins in vivo, but does not affect the growth of lipoylation deficient E. coli. Lpa can be truncated to 60% of its original size with only a partial loss of activity, resulting in a smaller probe that can be used to study the effects of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation in vivo.
TI  - DIAGNOdent laser fluorescence assessment of endodontic infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Real-time assessment of the microbial status of the root canal system would be useful in clinical endodontic practice for determining endpoints of biomechanical treatment. This laboratory study used an existing laser fluorescence device, the DIAGNOdent (KaVo, Biberach, Germany), in a proof-of-concept study. METHODS: Visible laser red light (wavelength 655 nm) was used to elicit fluorescence emissions in the near-infrared range from infected and uninfected root canals. A prototype sapphire tip designed for periodontal assessment was used to analyze the pulp chamber and coronal third of the root canal system in extracted teeth. The fluorescence properties of bacterial cultures, monospecies biofilms in root canals, pulpal soft tissues, and sound dentin were also evaluated, together with 50 extracted teeth with known endodontic pathology. RESULTS: Sound dentin and healthy pulpal soft tissue gave an average fluorescence reading of 5 (on a scale of 100), whereas biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans established in root canals showed a progressive increase in fluorescence over time. Fluorescence readings reduced to the "healthy" threshold reading of 5 when root canals were endodontically treated, and the experimentally created bacterial biofilms were removed completely. High fluorescence readings were recorded in the root canals and pulp chambers of extracted teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical pathology and scanning electron microscopy evidence of bacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the DIAGNOdent fluorescence approach for the assessment of the status of the pulp chamber and root canal system holds promise for clinical application; once more, flexible tips can be developed for gaining greater penetration into middle and apical thirds of the root canal.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three cements: new endodontic cement (NEC), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland.
AB  - Using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), new endodontic cement (NEC) and Portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar for Escherichia coli (ATCC 10538) and Candida (ATCC 10231). For Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541) and Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) blood agar medium was used. Wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The inhibition zones were then measured. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. The positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for Enterococcus faecalis. NEC created larger inhibition zones than MTA and Portland cement. This difference was significant for Portland cement (P < 0.05), but not for MTA (P > 0.05). Among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for Actinomyces group (P < 0.05). The antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (P < 0.05). It was concluded that NEC is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Expression, purification, characteristics and homology modeling of the HMGS from  Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the molecular basis for a potential reaction mechanism and develop novel antibiotics with homology modeling for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (HMGS). METHODS: The genetic engineering technology and the composer module of SYBYL7.0 program were used, while the HMGS three-dimensional structure was analyzed by homology modeling. RESULTS: The mvaS gene was cloned from Streptococcus pneumoniae and overexpressed in Escherichia coli from a pET28 vector. The expressed enzyme (about 46 kDa) was purified by affinity chromatography with a specific activity of 3.24 micromol/min/mg. Optimal conditions were pH 9.75 and 10 mmol/L MgCl2 at 37 degrees C. The V(max) and K(m) were 4.69 micromol/min/mg and 213 micromol/L respectively. The 3D model of S. pneumoniae HMGS was established based on structure template of HMGS of Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: The structure of HMGS will facilitate the structure-based design of alternative drugs to cholesterol-lowering therapies or to novel antibiotics to the Gram-positive cocci, whereas the recombinant HMGS will prove useful for drug development against a different enzyme in the mevalonate pathway.
TI  - Influence of Streptococcus mutans on Enterococcus faecalis biofilm formation.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An important virulence factor of Enterococcus faecalis is its ability to form biofilms. Most studies on biofilm formation have been carried out by using E. faecalis monocultures. Given the polymicrobial nature of root canal infections, it is important to understand biofilm formation of E. faecalis in the presence of other microorganisms. METHODS: Eight clinical strains of E. faecalis were tested for biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite disks in the presence and absence of a Streptococcus mutans biofilm. RESULTS: Significantly more E. faecalis viable cells were found in biofilms in the presence of S. mutans. This phenomenon was, however, strain-dependent. Of the 8 strains tested, biofilm formation of strains AA-OR34, ER5/1, and V583 was not influenced by S. mutans biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study, especially the strain difference, underline the importance of studying biofilm formation in a more realistic multispecies setting.
TI  - Contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. Although this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. METHODS: Biofilms of Streptococcus sanguinis, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in NaOCl, EDTA, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. The number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. The majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. The most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was NaOCl. Iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. The effectiveness of NaOCl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.
TI  - How common is MRSA in adult septic arthritis?
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adult septic arthritis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective review in 2 urban academic EDs in northern California, one tertiary care and one public. Subjects included patients who underwent arthrocentesis in the ED from April 2006 through July 2007. We queried the microbiology laboratory databases for synovial fluid cultures sent from the ED. We reviewed synovial fluid culture results and corresponding synovial fluid analyses and then classified positive culture results as true septic arthritis or likely contaminant. For septic arthritis cases, we reviewed medical records and abstracted presenting features. We report our findings with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred nine synovial fluid cultures were sent from the EDs. Twenty-three results (21%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14% to 30%) were positive, of which 9 were likely contaminants; 1 was from a soft tissue abscess and 1 was from bursitis. Of 12 septic arthritis cases, 6 cultures (50%; 95% CI 21% to 78%) grew MRSA, 4 (33%; 95% CI 7% to 60%) methicillin-susceptible S aureus, and 1 each (8%; 95% CI 0% to 24%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the 6 MRSA cases, 4 were in male patients; median age of patients was 47.5 years, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, 2 patients injected drugs, 2 patients were febrile, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, median synovial fluid leukocyte count was 15,184 cells/microL (range 3,400 to 34,075 cells/microL), and 5 patients received appropriate ED antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In this 2-ED population from a single geographic region, MRSA was the most common cause of community-onset adult septic arthritis. Synovial fluid cell counts were unexpectedly low in MRSA septic arthritis cases.
TI  - Research of urinary tract infections in family medicine physicians' offices--empiric antimicrobial therapy of urinary tract infections--Croatian experience.
AB  - In the period between October 1st and November 30th, 2006, we investigated a total of 3188 episodes of UTI (802 among males; 2386 among females) recorded in 108 family medicine offices in 20 cities in Croatia. The most common UTIs in women were acute uncomplicated cystitis (62%), complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (14%), urethritis (9%), acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (6%), recurrent cystitis (5%), asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%) and recurrent pyelonephritis. The most common UTIs in men were complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (48%), urethritis (25%), prostatitis (24%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%). Etiological diagnosis was made in 999 (31%) UTI episodes before antimicrobial therapy was given. The most frequently isolated causative pathogens were Escherichia coli (77%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), Klebsiella spp (3%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3%) and Enterobacter (1%). Antimicrobial drug was administered in 2939 (92.19%) UTI episodes, in 1940 (66.01%) as empirical therapy, and in 999 (34%) as targeted antimicrobial therapy. The most commonly administered drug in empirical therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent cystitis and urethritis in women was cephalexin, for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs in women co-amoxiclav, and for UTIs in males ciprofloxacin. The results of this research of 3188 UTI episodes in family medicine physicians' offices provide a confirmatory answer to question whether empirical antimicrobial therapy of UTI prescribed by Croatian family practitioners is in accordance with the national guidelines.
TI  - Trends in udder health and emerging mastitogenic pathogens in South African dairy herds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from South African dairy herds during the period 1996 to April 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. Milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9 provinces in South Africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. Although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general udder health in South Africa. Cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. According to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease in South Africa over the test period. The prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. Mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. The percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. Previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta haemolytic Staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Although Staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in South Africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. This finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described as a minor pathogen) significantly. Isolations of Streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus canis were isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while Enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.
TI  - [In vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against 499 strains of gram-positive cocci causing bloodstream infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, ceftobiprole and linezolid against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram-positive cocci. METHODS: Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of daptomycin with microbrothdilution method and the MICs of other 9 antimicrobial agents with agar dilution method against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram positive cocci was carried out. The data was analyzed with WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: The susceptibility rates of staphylococci to daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftobiprole, vancomycin and teicoplanin were 100%. All staphylococcus strains were inhibited by daptomycin at a MIC of 1 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 0.5 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MRSCoN). Among Enterococcus spp, the highest MIC of daptomycin was 4 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 2 mg/L against E.faecalis, whereas they were 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L against E.faecium. One strains of linezolid-resistant E.faecalis (MIC: 8 mg/L) was susceptible to daptomycin (MIC: 1 mg/L). Three strains of E.faecium carrying vanA gene with vancomycin MICs above 32 mg/L and teicoplanin MICs also 32 mg/L were susceptible to daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid. The MIC range of daptomycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus viridans was 0.032 - 0.25 mg/L and 0.125 - 1.000 mg/L separately. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin has excellent in vitro activity against common gram-positive pathogens isolated from blood. It may be a good choice for clinicians to treat drug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Increased d-lactic Acid intestinal bacteria in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  - Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are affected by symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and neurological impairment, the cause of which has yet to be elucidated. However, these symptoms are strikingly similar to those of patients presented with D-lactic acidosis. A significant increase of Gram positive facultative anaerobic faecal microorganisms in 108 CFS patients as compared to 177 control subjects (p<0.01) is presented in this report. The viable count of D-lactic acid producing Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. in the faecal samples from the CFS group (3.5 x 10(7) cfu/L and 9.8 x 10(7) cfu/L respectively) were significantly higher than those for the control group (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/L and 8.9 x 10(4) cfu/L respectively). Analysis of exometabolic profiles of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguinis, representatives of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. respectively, by NMR and HPLC showed that these organisms produced significantly more lactic acid (p<0.01) from (13)C-labeled glucose, than the Gram negative Escherichia coli. Further, both E. faecalis and S. sanguinis secrete more D-lactic acid than E. coli. This study suggests a probable link between intestinal colonization of Gram positive facultative anaerobic D-lactic acid bacteria and symptom expressions in a subgroup of patients with CFS. Given the fact that this might explain not only neurocognitive dysfunction in CFS patients but also mitochondrial dysfunction, these findings may have important clinical implications.
TI  - Molecular analysis of persistent periradicular lesions and root ends reveals a diverse microbial profile.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The microbial etiology of periradicular lesions is recognized; however, the bacterial profile of these lesions is not well elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization in these lesions and to characterize the bacterial community present in root ends and periradicular lesions. METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients who presented for apicoectomy of persistent periradicular lesions after endodontic therapy were selected for the study and samples of periradicular tissue and resected root ends collected. Total bacterial levels were estimated for 34 paired periradicular lesions and root ends using real-time polymerase chain reaction with universal bacterial primers. Sixteen pairs of these samples were analyzed using ribosomal 16S cloning and sequencing for bacterial identification. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected more consistently and at higher levels in root ends. Periradicular lesions exhibited a diverse microbial profile with many uncultivated phylotypes. Enterococcus faecalis and Burkholderia cepacia predominated in both samples. Campylobacter gracilis and Streptococcus gordonii were associated with root ends, whereas Atopobium rimae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus genomospecies C8, Dialister sp E2_20 E1, and Eubacterium strain A35MT were associated with periradicular lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent periradicular lesions are polymicrobial infections with many as-yet-uncultivated and unknown bacterial species. The bacterial load and microbial profile of root ends is significantly different from the soft-tissue lesion, indicating the presence of diverse bacterial populations in these tissues.
TI  - [Investigation of the situation of vaginal microflora in healthy women population].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the distribution of vaginal microflora in healthy women and  investigate their cognition of lower reproductive tract infection-related knowledge as well as personal hygiene habits and character of behavior in seeking medical treatment. METHODS: Total of 1660 healthy women who had physical check-ups at the Medical Center of Renji Hospital were selected and received gynecologic examination, as well as routine examination, pH examination and bacterial culture of the vaginal discharge. In addition, 860 of them were randomly selected for questionnaire survey, in which reproductive tract infection -related knowledge and personal hygiene habits as well as behavior in seeking medical treatment were involved. RESULTS: Among the 1660 censused women, vaginal average pH was 4. 16 +/- 0.21. The positive rate of Candida in vaginal discharge routine examination was 3.86% (64/1660), which was lower than that in aerobes culture 7.71% (128/1660). Candida albicans was the most populous species 78.9% (101/128), followed by 7.8% (10/128) and 7.0% (9/128) for the Candida glabrata and Candida krusei respectively. The most populous species of vaginal microflora were hemolytic streptococcus A (63.80%, 1059/1660), Staphylococcus epidermidis (14.28%, 237/1660), and Enterococcus faecalis (D) group (11.44%, 190/1660). The questionnaire survey showed that 88.4% (760/860) of 860 women took active treatment when feeling unwell, 92.1% (792/860) of them had good hygiene practices, and only 21.2% (182/860) had the habit of vaginal douching. In addition, 50.0% (430/860) of them had the desire to obtain reproductive health knowledge through out-patient consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Vulvovaginal Candida disease ranks the first in all types of vaginitis, among which, Candida albicans is the most populous species followed by the Candida glabrata and Candida krusei. Hemolytic streptococcus A and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common species of vaginal microflora in healthy women. The censused women have high awareness of reproductive health care and pay much attention to common gynecologic diseases such as lower reproductive tract infection. Nevertheless, we should strengthen the public education of reproductive health-related knowledge.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  - Racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 exhibited low in vitro MICs toward small, selected panels of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against Haemophilus influenzae. The constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. DHFRs encoded by dfrB, dfrA (S1 isozyme), dfrE, and folA were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas DHFRs encoded by dfrG (S3 isozyme) and dfrF were not. Studies with the separated enantiomers of BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible DHFRs by the (R)-enantiomers. BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. Using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Effect of three methods for cleaning dentures on biofilms formed in vitro on acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three denture hygiene methods against different microbial biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The set (sterile stainless steel basket and specimens) was contaminated (37 degrees C for 48 hours) by a microbial inoculum with 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml (standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis; field strains: S. mutans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis). After inoculation, specimens were cleansed by the following methods: (1) chemical: immersion in an alkaline peroxide solution (Bonyplus tablets) for 5 minutes; (2) mechanical: brushing with a dentifrice for removable prostheses (Dentu Creme) for 20 seconds; and (3) a combination of chemical and mechanical methods. Specimens were applied onto a Petri plate with appropriate culture medium for 10 minutes. Afterward, the specimens were removed and the plates incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. RESULTS: Chemical, mechanical, and combination methods showed no significant difference in the reduction of CFU for S. aureus, S. mutans (ATCC and field strain), and P. aeruginosa. Mechanical and combination methods were similar and more effective than the chemical method for E. faecalis, C. albicans (ATCC and field strain), and C. glabrata. The combination method was better than the chemical method for E. coli and C. tropicalis, and the mechanical method showed intermediate results. CONCLUSION: The three denture hygiene methods showed different effects depending on the type of microbial biofilms formed on acrylic base resin specimens.
TI  - Resistance to bacitracin in Streptococcus pyogenes from oropharyngeal colonization and noninvasive infections in Portugal was caused by two clones of distinct virulence genotypes.
AB  - During 2000-2007 in Lisbon, we identified 45 bacitracin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates among 1629 isolates: 24 from oropharyngeal healthy carriers (out of 1026), 21 from patients with noninvasive infections (out of 559) and zero from invasive infections (out of 44). Forty-four of those isolates, mainly of colonization, are low-level bacitracin-resistant members of the cMLS(B)-macrolide-resistant and tetracycline-susceptible emm28/ST52 clone previously detected in Europe, but only among clinical samples. One high-level bacitracin-resistant isolate, associated with a tonsillitis/pharyngitis episode, is cMLS(B)-macrolide-resistant and tetracycline-resistant member of the emm74/ST120 lineage, which was not previously known to include bacitracin-resistant isolates. The bcrABDR operon encoding an ATP-binding cassette transporter in Enterococcus faecalis was not detected among these bacitracin-resistant S. pyogenes strains. Virulence profiling indicated that genes coding for exotoxins and superantigens seem to be clone specific. This study provides an increased knowledge about specific bacitracin-resistant S. pyogenes strains, which may be useful in future investigations aiming to understand the mechanism(s) leading to bacitracin resistance and the cause(s) for differences in colonization and/or dissemination potential.
TI  - Characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and DNA identification of atypical Lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. By combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16S rRNA gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west Algeria. Forty strains phenotypically related to cocci LAB were identified as belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and other Enterococcus species. No Streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. Ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. In particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% NaCl, at pH 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. Lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. Further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Combination of 10% EDTA, Photosan, and a blue light hand-held photopolymerizer to inactivate leading oral bacteria in dentistry in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to investigate the phototoxicity of Photosan in  combination with EDTA and a hand-held photopolymerizer used in dentistry for light-curing resins against leading key pathogens in caries, endodontic treatment failures, and periodontitis respectively. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cellular uptake of Photosan was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis but not for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Addition of 10% EDTA enabled the uptake of Photosan by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Killing of S. mutans and E. faecalis mediated by Photosan and blue light was concentration and light dose dependent, achieving a >or=99.9% (>or=3 log(10) reduction) efficacy of bacteria killing. In the presence of 10% EDTA, Photosan induced a reduction of >or=4 log(10) in the viability of A. actinomycetemcomitans at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1), upon activation at a dose of 9.65 J cm(-2) for 60 s. EDTA alone, light alone, and Photosan alone were not able to kill bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Ten per cent EDTA and Photosan cause a potent phototoxicity against oral bacteria upon illumination with a photopolymerizer. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Increasing antibiotic resistance and insufficient drug concentrations within the sulcus fluid are responsible for lacking antimicrobial efficacy. This study provides useful information that combination of Photosan, EDTA, and a photopolymerizer may be a potentially powerful tool for the efficient destroying of key oral bacteria.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in E. coli.
AB  - The increased synthesis of building blocks of IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) and DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. Using E. coli as a host, IPP and DMAPP supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign MVA (mevalonate) pathway into it. The MVA pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-CoA, and IPP and DMAPP from mevalonate, respectively. The bottom portions of MVA pathway from Streptococcus pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant Escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. The E. coli harboring the bottom MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. The top portions of MVA pathway were also compared and the top MVA pathway of E. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in E. coli. The whole MVA pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis, respectively. The recombinant E. coli harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without exogenous mevalonate supplementation. When comparing various E. coli strains - MG1655, DH5alpha, S17-1, XL1-Blue and BL21 - the DH5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. Using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. The recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/L at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).
TI  - TGF-beta1 Inhibits TLR-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  - TGF-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. Odontoblasts extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from TGF-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. This study aimed to determine the role of TGF-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. We show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4 on the cell surface. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum activated both TLRs, but TLR4 played a greater role. Lack of cell-surface TLR2 was associated with poor response to Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus casei. TGF-beta1 inhibited TLR2 and TLR4 expression and attenuated odontoblast responses. Our findings suggest that the balance between TLR-mediated inflammation and TGF-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in pulpal inflammation.
TI  - Antibacterial endiandric acid derivatives from Beilschmiedia anacardioides.
AB  - Three endiandric acid derivatives, beilschmiedic acids A, B and C were isolated from the stem bark of Beilschmiedia anacardioides together with the known beta-sitosterol. Their structures were established by means of modern spectroscopic techniques. The relative configuration of compound 1 was determined by single crystal X-ray analysis. The antibacterial activities of compounds A,B,C were evaluated in vitro against five strains of microbes. Compound C showed strong activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus faecalis (MICs below 23 microM). This Compound was more active than the reference antibiotic ampicillin against B. subtilis and M. luteus.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent Gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  - Doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the United States for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. Although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading Gram-positive species. We evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (North America, 43.0%; Latin America, 11.7%; Europe, 31.3%; and Asia-Pacific, 14.0%) Doripenem Surveillance Program for the years 2003 to 2007. Doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; MIC(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/mL), with no differences noted between geographic regions. Against Enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC(50), 4 microg/mL) but was largely inactive against Enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). Although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the United States, doripenem was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. Doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; MIC(90), <or=0.06 microg/mL, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; MIC(90), 0.25 microg/mL). Doripenem appears broadly active in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Potency and bactericidal activity of iclaprim against recent clinical gram-positive isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of iclaprim, a novel diaminopyrimidine derivative, was evaluated against 5,937 recent gram-positive clinical isolates collected in the United States and Europe. Iclaprim demonstrated potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis strains tested. In addition, iclaprim exhibited bactericidal activity against all S. aureus strains tested, including MRSA.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  - Clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.
TI  - Spectrum of activity and mode of action of REP3123, a new antibiotic to treat Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of REP3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in development for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS: The spectrum of activity of REP3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of C. difficile and non-target organisms. The mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. RESULTS: REP3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of C. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains (MIC range=0.5-1 mg/L and MIC(90) = 1 mg/L). The spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90)s < 1 mg/L), but REP3123 was not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. REP3123 targeted C. difficile MetRS with a calculated inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.020 nM, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MetRS. The specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by REP3123, and by metS overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in MIC for REP3123. Spontaneous REP3123-resistant mutants of C. difficile (MICs, 4-128 mg/L) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the metS gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. Most of the MetRS substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target C. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  - The bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of Fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. Total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Representative bands of DGGE patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. The use of universal primer for PCR-DGGE allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also for other adventitious species. DGGE profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) recurred in many samples (Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. The microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant LAB but also adventitious bacteria (Macrococcus caseolyticus, Rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Chryseobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees C of coagulated milk. Pantoea spp. was primarily found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. Finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. These species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
TI  - TR-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: TR-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug TR-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous Gram-positive species. In this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of TR-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. METHODS: One hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. Species of isolates were: Enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16 wild-type strains); Enterococcus faecium (55/55), Staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23S rRNA target mutations or cfr genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were G2576T (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from Europe, Far East and North and South America. Most strains were multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin B. TR-700 MIC values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. TR-700 MIC results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/L for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. Spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest TR-700 MIC elevations compared with linezolid controls. CONCLUSIONS: TR-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of Gram-positive cocci. A significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/L) of TR-700. All strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had TR-700 MIC results at < or = 8 mg/L.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Structural studies of the Enterococcus faecalis SufU [Fe-S] cluster protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. Three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular Fe-S proteins have been determined, designated the NIF, ISC and SUF systems. Although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Within the Firmicutes phylum, the Enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein Enterococcus faecalis represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in Enterococcus faecalis V583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it SufU protein. RESULTS: BLAST searches of the Enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli SUF machinery of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufB, sufC, sufD and SufS. In addition, the E. coli IscU ortholog SufU was found to be the scaffold protein of Enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (Cys50,76,138 and Asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other Gram-positive bacteria. Molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using E. faecalis SufU primary sequence protein over the PDB:1su0 crystallographic model from Streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. This presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. Molecular modeling using Haemophilus influenzae IscU primary sequence over the PDB:1su0 crystal followed by a MD trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the C-terminus region of Gram-positive SufU and Gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. CONCLUSION: The data describe the identification of the SUF machinery for [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis present in the Firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufB, sufC, sufD and sufS genes and the presence of the sufU gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufA; neither sufE nor sufR are present. Primary sequences and structural analysis of the SufU protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern to the scaffold protein IscU nearby on the ISC machinery. E. faecalis SufU molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in Firmicutes denoting the Gram positive region (GPR), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements ICESt1 and ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. The current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ICEs in Streptococcus thermophilus, ICESt1 and ICESt3. Mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent, derepresses ICESt3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. The ICESt3 host range was determined using various members of the Firmicutes as recipients. Whereas numerous ICESt3 transconjugants of Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of Lactococcus lactis was obtained. The newly incoming ICEs, except the one from L. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. Furthermore, ICESt3 was retransferred from E. faecalis to S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the ICESt1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ICEs, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - Comparative bioequivalence and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in healthy male  subjects.
AB  - Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies of two ciprofloxacin tablet brands (trial batch of ciprofloxacin (Test) & Reference) were conducted in 14 healthy male volunteers after oral administration. Each brand (test and reference) consisted of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin. The drug was analyzed in plasma samples with a microbiological assay using Streptococcus faecalis as test organism. The elimination half-life of 3.00 +/- 0.21 and 3.28 +/- 0.11 h was calculated for both brands. The peak plasma concentrations of (3.59 +/-0.26 ug/mL) and (3.34 +/- 1.20 ug/mL) was attained in about 1.48 +/- 0.11 hour and 1.47+/-0.05 for both Test and Reference ciprofloxacin respectively. The mean +/- SE values for total area under the curve (AUC O-alpha) were 26.15 +/- 1.35, and 24.95 +/- 0.93 hmg/1 for both test and reference tablets respectively. The mean +/- SE values of clearance were 24.83+/-1.63 and 24.73+/-1.11 1/h for both formulations respectively. The ratio of elimination rate constant Kel [l/h] was 1.14 percent difference between the test and reference tablets and likewise, half-life (t1/2beta) expressed in hours showed the ratio of 0.91 percent. This study indicated that all the pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence parameters for both ciprofloxacin formulations are statistically non-significant, hence both formulations are bioequivalent.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of silver-zeolite containing root-canal filling material.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial effect of two experimental glass ionomer cements (GICs) on Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis after 24 and 48 h incubation by using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. Silver zeolite (SZ) was added at 0.2 and 2% mass fraction concentration to GIC (Endion). The control group was Endion with no SZ. Each of them were prepared to uniform size using a custom-made Teflon mold, and the GIC materials were prepared to form disks (n = 5 per group). The effect of these materials on the growth of three bacteria associated with endodontic infections was determined using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. The amounts of silver ion release from these materials were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10 min, 24- and 48-h periods. The pH of samples was measured with a pH-meter at 10 min, 24- and 48-h periods. After the incubation period, the agar plates were evaluated and the degrees of bacterial inhibition were measured in millimeters. A comparison of the mean of the test materials was statistically different in each group of specimens (p < 0.05). Between the two tested materials 2% SZ containing GIC showed the largest zone of inhibition on the agar plates of all the tested strains (p < 0.05). The most inhibition in bacterial growth occurred in E. faecalis. Adding 2% SZ to GIC resulted in a significant increase in the silver release into deionized water. This study demonstrated that GIC had an inhibitory affect on Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis and that adding SZ increases that affect proportional to its concentration.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of the novel peptide CECT7121 against bacteria isolated from mastitic dairy cattle.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the novel antimicrobial peptide (AP) CECT7121 against Gram-positive bacteria from mastitic dairy cattle. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 15 Staphylococcus aureus, 10 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 7 Strep. uberis, 1 Strep. agalactiae strains were isolated from 33 different mastitic dairy cattle, sourced from two dairies in Tandil-Argentina. Isolates from each of the bacterial species screened which developed the lowest inhibition zones in response to the peptide, were further evaluated in a series of time-killing curve studies. No survivors were detected in whole strains (from the three Streptococcal species isolated) within 120 min of incubation in presence of the peptide. The Staph. aureus isolates were less sensitive but, nevertheless, a drop in viable counts to below the detection limit was achieved for all the test strains by the final postincubation sampling point at 180 min. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of the AP-CECT7121 against a variety strains of Gram positives isolated from mastitic dairy cattle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There is urgent global interest in the development of natural alternatives for the control and prevention of mastitis. Confirmation of the in vitro activity of the novel AP-CECT7121 against Gram-positive isolates encourages further research.
TI  - Ex vivo antimicrobial activity of several bleaching agents used during the walking bleach technique.
AB  - AIM: To investigate ex vivo the antimicrobial activity of a paste of sodium perborate associated with various vehicles comparing it with 37% carbamide peroxide and 35% hydrogen peroxide. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activity of these agents was evaluated against three microorganisms: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. One millilitre of each tested substance was placed on the bottom of wells of 24-well cell culture plates. Six wells were used for each time period and group. Two millilitres of the microbial suspension was ultrasonically mixed for 10 s with the bleaching pastes and placed in contact with them for 10, 30, 45 s; 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30 min; and 1 and 2 h. After each period of time, 1 mL from each well was transferred to tubes containing 2 mL of freshly prepared brain heart infusion agar + neutralizers. Agar plates were inoculated in appropriate gaseous conditions. Data were analysed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test with the level of significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: In all groups containing chlorhexidine (groups 3, 5 and 7), the antimicrobial activity of the bleaching paste was significantly increased when compared with groups with other kinds of vehicle (groups 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8). For all tested groups, the most resistant microorganism was E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine when used as a vehicle for sodium perborate enhanced its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Constituents and antimicrobial properties of blue honeysuckle: a novel source for phenolic antioxidants.
AB  - The fruit of Lonicera caerulea L. (blue honeysuckle; Caprifoliaceae) and its phenolic fraction were analyzed for nutrients and micronutrients. The phenolic fraction was prepared from berries percolated with 0.1% H3PO4 and SPE using Sepabeads SP207. The sugar and lipid content was analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. The total content of anthocyanins was determined using the pH differential absorbance method and aliphatic acids by capillary electrophoresis. MicroLC-MS/MS was used for determination of cyanidin-3-glucoside (the predominant anthocyanin), 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, paeonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, quercetin, its 3-glucoside, and 3-rutinoside, epicatechin, protocatechuic, gentisic, ellagic, ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and coumaric acids. The phenolic fraction displayed Folin-Ciocalteu reagent reducing (335 +/- 15 microg of gallic acid equivalent/mg) and DPPH and superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 12.1 +/- 0.1 and 115.5 +/- 6.4 microg/mL) and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation (IC50 160 +/- 20 microg/mL). The freeze-dried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of Candida parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: SENTRY surveillance program, Spain (2002-2006)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. In this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered in 3 Spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international SENTRY antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The possible therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of Spanish susceptibility data. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. RESULTS: All the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. The highest MIC values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. In addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against Enterococcus faecalis. Daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. viridans group isolates. The distribution of daptomycin MIC values in S. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. CONCLUSION: The sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in Spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.
TI  - Study of bacterial infections among the patients with suspected cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of secondary bacterial infections in the patients with cutaneous lesions. The patients admitted to leishmaniasis laboratory of faculty of health, Tehran university of medical sciences from October 2004 to June 2005 were subjected in this study. Clinical samples were analyzed using standard bacteriological and parasitological methods. One hundred seventy three patients were subjected to this study and leishmania was found in 84 (48.5%) cases. According to bacteriological experiments, 47 cases (55.9%) had been also infected by bacterial infections. The most prevalent bacterial isolates included group D Streptococcus (19.1%), Enterococcus spp. (19.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.7%). The findings of current study indicated that the bacterial infections are still an important problem in the patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and should be considered in treating these patients.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Cochlospermum planchoni Hook.f. ex Planch essential oil from Burkina Faso.
AB  - The water distilled oil obtained from rhizomes of Cochlospermum planchonii Hook.f.ex Planch (Apocynaceae) from Burkina Faso was examined by GC and GC/MS. Cochlospermum planchonii oil presents a particular chemical composition with a high rate of oxygenated components with predominance of ketones and esters (86.4%). The essential oil was tested against twelve strains of bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The results suggest that Cochlospermum planchonii essential oil has significant bactericidal activity.
TI  - Development of chemically defined media supporting high-cell-density growth of lactococci, enterococci, and streptococci.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was used as an experimental strain to develop a chemically defined medium for study of the physiology and metabolic pathways of lactococci. An experimental leave-one-out technique was employed to determine the necessity of each of the 57 chemical components used in medium development. A statistical experimental design approach including three fractional factorial designs and a central composite design was used to optimize the fermentation process with 21 variables composed of 19 nutritional factors grouped from the 57 components and two environmental factors (initial pH and temperature). For L. lactis IL1403, the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the two optimal chemically defined media developed in this study (ZMB1 and ZMB2) were generally 3.5- to 4-fold higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the previously described best synthetic media (SA) and 50% to 68% higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with M17, a complex medium commonly used for lactococci. The new chemically defined media support high-cell-density growth of numerous strains of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - What's new and not so new on the antimicrobial horizon?
AB  - Despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multiple drug resistance in clinical isolates of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. The few new agents that have been recently licensed have tended to have narrow spectra of activity, focused on Gram-positive pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This situation is rightly causing concern among clinicians and public health authorities worldwide. This article reviews available data on three new antibacterials currently in development. The cephalosporin ceftobiprole is active against MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, but otherwise has a spectrum of activity similar to that of other recent cephalosporins. In a clinical trial, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA-associated complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs). Doripenem, a new carbapenem, has some activity against MRSA, but otherwise has an anti-Gram-positive spectrum of activity similar to that of imipenem and an anti-Gram-negative spectrum similar to that of meropenem. In a clinical trial, it was non-inferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. Iclaprim is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor with greatly enhanced activity, as compared with trimethoprim, against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The limited literature concerning this agent has concentrated on its potential role in the treatment of infections with Gram-positive bacteria. A clinical trial has demonstrated the non-inferiority of iclaprim, as compared with linezolid, in the treatment of cSSSIs, including those associated with MRSA.
TI  - Change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  - Elemental diet (ED) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of ED remain unclear. In interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ED using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ED. ED significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. The total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ED. T-RFLP profiles of the ED group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. The diversity of bacterial species in the ED group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. Among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. Lactobacillus reuteri and L. johnsonii decreased and Enterococcus faecalis and E. durans increased in the ED group. The culture supernatant of L. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 activity in RAW 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of E. faecalis and E. durans barely induced their activity. These data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ED seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.
TI  - Screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  - Bovine mastitis (BM) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. The prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. In the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. Samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. A screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. Somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. Pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. Compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of pH, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. The other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. One hundred and two LAB strains were isolated. Most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. No correlation between these properties was found. Antagonistic metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. Most of the pre-selected strains were identified as Streptococcus bovis and Weissella paramesenteroides. Three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. The results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent BM.
TI  - Lagging-strand DNA replication origins are required for conjugal transfer of the  promiscuous plasmid pMV158.
AB  - The promiscuous streptococcal plasmid pMV158 is mobilizable by auxiliary plasmids and replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism in a variety of bacterial hosts. The plasmid has two lagging-strand origins, ssoA and ssoU, involved in the conversion of single-stranded DNA intermediates into double-stranded plasmid DNA during vegetative replication. Transfer of the plasmid also would involve conversion of single-stranded DNA molecules into double-stranded plasmid forms in the recipient cells by conjugative replication. To test whether lagging-strand origins played a role in horizontal transfer, pMV158 derivatives defective in one or in both sso's were constructed and tested for their ability to colonize new hosts by means of intra- and interspecies mobilization. Whereas either sso supported transfer between strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, only plasmids that had an intact ssoU could be efficiently mobilized from S. pneumoniae to Enterococcus faecalis. Thus, it appears that ssoU is a critical factor for pMV158 promiscuity and that the presence of a functional sso plays an essential role in plasmid transfer.
TI  - Novel pyridazine derivatives: Synthesis and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - A general method for the preparation of new hydrazones is reported. The 1-[4-(2-methoxybenzyl)-6-aryl pyridazin-3(2H)-ylidene] hydrazines or their tautomeric structures (1(a-d)) were condensed with different aldehydes, dialdehydes, ketones, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and simple carbohydrates to afford the hydrazones and dihydrazones (2(a-d)), (3(a-d)), (4(a-d)), (5(a-d)), (6(d)), (7(c)), (8(a-d)), (9(a-d)), (10(a-d)), (11(a-d)), (12(a,c,d)), (13(a-d)), (14(a-d)), (15(a-d)), (16(a-d)) and (17(a-d)). The structures of all synthesized compounds were confirmed from microanalytical and spectral data. Some of the products were screened for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hydrazone derivative 15(d) (1-[4-(2-methoxybenzyl)-6-methylphenyl pyridazin-3(2H)-ylidene]-2-(2-carboxydiphenyl methyl) hydrazine) showed the highest biological activity.
TI  - Streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).
AB  - HPr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). In gram-positive bacteria, HPr can be phosphorylated on Ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase HprK/P and on His-15 by phospho-enzyme I (EI~P) of the PTS. In vitro studies with purified HPrs from Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. However, a recent study showed that while the rate of Streptococcus salivarius HPr phosphorylation by EI~P is reduced at acidic pH, the phosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) by EI~P, generating HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), is stimulated. This suggests that HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality. Consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) have been detected in some streptococci. The present study was aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular pH. Our results indicated that unlike Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis, and E. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) during growth. We also showed that Streptococcus salivarius IIABLMan, a protein involved in sugar transport by the PTS, could be efficiently phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).
TI  - Bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. However,few studies available on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. This study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. A retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between September 2002 and February 2005 at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. In 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Klebsiella species (17%), Escherichia coli (10.6%), Proteus species (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), Streptococcus species (1.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and Candida albicans (0.8%). High rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. This high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. Continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.
TI  - A promising microbiological test for the diagnosis of drowning.
AB  - A number of biological and chemical tests have been developed over the years to determine whether a person was drowned. This study focuses on the potential of a microbiological test for detecting common bacterial markers of water faecal pollution such as faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) as possible indicators of drowning. A promising previous study was carried out on central and peripheral blood samples of 42 drowned victims (20 cases in saltwater and 22 cases in freshwater) and 30 not-drowned bodies. To improve the accuracy of our previous results and also in order to investigate a possible cause of a false positive due to pulmonary passive diffusion and subsequently endogenous or exogenous bacterial invasion of the blood in the post-mortem interval (PMI), the FC and FS test was applied to bodies submerged in water but died from causes other than drowning. In the present study, blood samples collected from the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), femoral artery (FA) and, femoral vein (FV) of 10 drowned victims (5 cases in freshwater and 5 cases in seawater) and 3 not-drowned individuals with bodies submerged in water for a while after death have been analysed. Preliminary results are in agreement with other reports dealing with diatoms and marine bacteria that suggest to exclude the hypothesis of a passive penetration of sufficient quantities of drowning medium into circulation after death or during the agonal period. Based on our results there is also no evidence of a relevant dissemination of endogenous micro-flora from the gastrointestinal tract affecting the FS and FC test. There are still several other factors that could influence the applicability of post-mortem FS and FC cultures for the diagnosis of drowning and they need further investigations. The present article provides only a glimpse of the potential of the FS and FC test as bacteriological method for the diagnosis of drowning.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant effects of bacterial genomic DNA and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides on  avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine in chicken.
AB  - This study investigated the immunoadjuvant effects of three types of bacterial genomic DNA and CpG oligonucleotides (CpG ODN) on the avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine under two immunization strategies. The genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli O(2), Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus faecalis FQ68, and synthetic CpG ODN were used as adjuvants, and their effects on the AIV oil emulsion vaccine were examined in chickens. The results indicated that when administered separately from the vaccine, adjuvants induced lower haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres and serum IgG titres but resulted in higher concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-10. In contrast, when combined with the oil emulsion vaccine prior to inoculation, CpG ODN induced higher HI, IgG titres and IFN-gamma concentration but resulted in lower IL-10 concentration. These data suggest that, depending on the immunization approaches, adjuvants may exert distinct immune effects in chickens receiving AIV H5N1 oil emulsion vaccine: the prior incorporation of CpG ODN into the vaccine may augment both the humoral and Th1 type immune responses, while separate inoculation of adjuvants has not shown better adjuvanticity.
TI  - [Recurrent infective endocarditis. A case report].
AB  - We report the case of a 63-year old patient presenting five infective endocarditis (IE) in a 13-years period, with different types of streptococcus. No entrance way had been found until the last relapse occurring on mitro-aortic bioprosthesis. This recurrence leads to the diagnosis of caecal adenocarcinoma by coloscopy, preceded and guided by PET scanner. It seems to be the initial entrance way which had been unrecognized because of its small size and its particular location, that is very difficult to observe by coloscopy. Recurrent streptococcus IE are rare and severe. When a gut or colic tumor is suspected, PET scan seems to be helpful in etiological survey.
TI  - Characterization of guanylate kinase from gram positive and gram negative microorganisms; preliminary results.
AB  - Guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the CORE, LID, and NMP-binding regions. Guanylate kinase (GMPK) is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of GTP and dGTP by catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to (d)GMP resulting in ADP and (d)GDP. Despite the similar fold of the monomer there is an important difference between GMPKs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes: eukaryotes GMPK are monomers while prokaryotes GMPK are dimmers, tetramers or hexamers. For this reason bacterial GMPKs are possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. Finding new targets for antibacterial therapies is a prior subject in today's medical research. The purpose of this work was to characterize guanylate kinases from both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria. We started with GMPK from Enterococcus faecalis as gram positive microorganism and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram negative representative.
TI  - Large-scale filter mating assay for intra- and inter-specific conjugal transfer of the promiscuous plasmid pMV158 in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many conjugative or mobilizable plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria can be transferred mainly on filter-based surfaces. Such is the case of the streptococcal promiscuous plasmid pMV158 which can be mobilized by functions provided by auxiliary plasmids of the Inc18 family. We have developed a new large scale method consisting of a 96-well microtiter plate coupled with a filter so that we could perform several mating assays between strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and between S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis cells. Transfer was monitored by employment of a derivative plasmid from pMV158 tagged with the gene encoding the Green Fluorescent Protein. Several experimental conditions, like different ratios donor to recipient cells, could be tested, thus allowing us to perform multiple mating assays in a single experiment.
TI  - Assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  - In contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. The objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. Samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. Several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. Staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. One representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Among the 48 S. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icaD gene and the mecA gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. In parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cylA, vanA, vanB, vanD, vanE and vanG genes. All of them were sensitive to vancomycin. There were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.
TI  - Evidence-based efficacy of ozone for root canal irrigation.
AB  
TI  - Pharmacodynamic activity of the lantibiotic MU1140.
AB  - This study evaluated the pharmacodynamics of the lantibiotic MU1140 and the ability of selected organisms to develop resistance to this antibiotic. MU1140 demonstrated activity against all Gram-positive organisms tested, including oxacillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF). No activity was observed against Gram-negative bacteria or yeast. Time-kill studies revealed that MU1140 was rapidly bactericidal against Streptococcus pneumoniae and multidrug-resistant S. aureus, whilst it was bacteriostatic against VREF. In vitro resistance development to MU1140, tested by sequential subculturing in subinhibitory concentrations of MU1140, revealed a stable threefold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. Subsequent subculturing of the strains with elevated MICs in antibiotic-free media for 7 days did not result in a reduction of their MIC values for MU1140. Collectively, our findings illustrate the therapeutic potential of MU1140 for management of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Catalytic site-selective synthesis and evaluation of a series of erythromycin analogs.
AB  - The generation of a series of analogs of erythromycin A (EryA, 2) is described. In this study, we compared two peptide-based catalysts-one originally identified from a catalyst screen (5) and its enantiomer (ent-5)-for the selective functionalization of EryA. The semi-synthetic analogs were subjected to MIC evaluation with two bacterial strains and compared to unfunctionalized EryA.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new resin-based endodontic sealer against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of a new resin-based SuperBond (SB) Sealer and five other sealers/cements against endodontic pathogens. The antimicrobial activities of SB Sealer, Sealapex, AH plus, Roeko Seal Automix, Canals N, and ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) were examined using a double-layered method. The microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguinis were used. Live microorganisms were stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the zones of inhibition of microorganism growth were measured. The antimicrobial activity of SB Sealer was significantly lower than that of the other sealers, except for Pro Root MTA, against S. aureus, C. albicans, S. mutans, and S. sanguinis, but no activity against E. faecalis was detected. On the other hand, AH plus exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. Pro Root MTA showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested. SB Sealer offered no antimicrobial advantage over the other sealers tested except for Pro Root MTA.
TI  - An agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. Mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations UltraCal XS and Vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. Each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. Zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. Multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc Student Neuman Keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. Larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. Vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% UltraCal XS with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% Ca(OH)(2) in inhibitory activity. Formulations containing 50-60% Ca(OH)(2) or 35% Ca(OH)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) accelerates identification of Gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. To accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) targeting Gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. By combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium/durans. Furthermore, the newly designed FISH probes STREP2, ENCO and GRANU targeted Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, Enterococcus spp. (except E. faecalis) and Granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. The FISH assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and reliable molecular identification of Gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - Surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and contraceptive agents in recent years. In the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (MDCK) cells, human sperm cells, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of MDCK cells was also tested. A homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromides (C(n)TAB), with varying alkyl chains were shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (CMC), all of them at concentrations significantly below the CMC. In general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than C. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than MDCK cells. This suggests that the C(n)TAB may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. None of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection of MDCK cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to MDCK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  - Two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA-Ival), isolated from Aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of KA (KA-Me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. KA was the most active compound, with MIC values of 10 microg mL(-1) against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. However, KA did not show significant activity against Streptococcus salivarius and Enterococcus faecalis, with MIC values equal to 100 and 200 microg mL(-1), respectively. Our results show that KA has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. Moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Novel endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  - In an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-GalNAcases), four potential genes were cloned. Three of the expressed proteins EngEF from Enterococcus faecalis, EngPA from Propionibacterium acnes, and EngCP from Clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. Their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-GalNAcases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (EngSP) and Alcaligenes sp. (EngAL). All enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. The Core 1 disaccharide Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. EngEF exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. EngEF and EngPA were also able to fully hydrolyze the Core 3 disaccharide GlcNAc beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP. This is the first report of endo-alpha-GalNAcases EngEF and EngPA acting on Core 3 in addition to Core 1 O-glycans. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP or GlcNAc beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-GalNAcases tested in this work.
TI  - Microorganisms in root canal-treated teeth from a German population.
AB  - Posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. This study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from German patients using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed to detect Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Bacterial DNA was detected in all samples. Twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. Taxa detected more frequently included Streptococcus species (47%), Lactobacillus species (35%), Dialister invisus (29%), Eubacterium infirmum (29%), Prevotella intermedia (29%), Selenomonas sputigena (29%), Synergistes oral clone BA121 (29%), and Treponema denticola (29%). Only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). Of these, streptococci and T. denticola were the most prevalent. Species-specific PCR detected E. faecalis in 47% of the cases and C. albicans in 6%. Findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. Most cases harbored a mixed infection, and E. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. Several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.
TI  - Immunoproteomic assay of extracellular proteins in Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus.
AB  - A proteomic approach combining two-dimensional electrophoresis, Western blot and  matrix-assisted laser desorption tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry has been used to map the extracellular proteins of Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) strain ATCC 35246. These bioinformatic technologies facilitated the identification of novel S. zooepidemicus vaccine candidate antigens and therapeutic agents. Despite the limitations posed by the unavailability of complete genome and proteome data for S. zooepidemicus, seven of 15 chosen immunogenic spots were successfully identified as streptococcal proteins (AE1 and AE4 c. 10) from homologous Streptococcus species. Among these, AE6 and AE7 were identified as S. zooepidemicus UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine pyrophosphorylase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase proteins. In addition, AE4 was determined to be glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis. Following SIGNALIP 3.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/servicess/SignalIP) prediction, data suggested that AE5, AE7 and AE9 contained signal peptides. BLAST (http://www.sanger.ac.uk) results found that nucleotide sequences of all identified proteins shared high homology (> or = 65%) with S. zooepidemicus. The majority of proteins identified in our study remain formally unreported in S. zooepidemicus. However, these proteins serve a vital role in the immune system and reproduction of host species. Therefore, we further evaluated the proteins as vaccine candidates in this study.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Thymus daenensis methanolic extract.
AB  - Medicinal plants are potential of antimicrobial compounds. The present study deals with the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thymus daenensis. Aerial parts of the plant were collected from Alvand mountainside (Hamadan, Iran) in May 2005, air-dried and extracted by methanol. The dried extract was redissolved in methanol to make a 100 mg/ml solution and then filtered. Antibacterial activity of the extract was evaluated against various Gram-positive and Gram-negatives bacteria using disk diffusion technique. Blank paper disks were loaded with 40 microl of the methanol solution and then dried up. The impregnated disks were placed on Mueller-Hinton agar inoculated with bacterial suspension equal to 0.5 McFarland. The extract inhibited the growth Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Entrococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, but it showed no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The most significant effect was seen against S.aureus including MRSA, which are important nosocomial pathogens. MIC90 of the extract was determined against Gram-positive bacteria (3.12 mg/ml) and 11 MRSA strain (1.56 mg/ml).
TI  - Newly defined in vitro quality control ranges for oritavancin broth microdilution testing and impact of variation in testing parameters.
AB  - A 9-laboratory M23-A2 quality control (QC) study was performed to evaluate reproducibility of oritavancin MICs against reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae using broth microdilution assays in the presence of polysorbate 80. Polysorbate 80 has previously been shown to be required for accurate measurement of oritavancin broth microdilution MICs. Greater than 95% of replicate results (n = 270/organism) fell within the following QC ranges (in micrograms per milliliter): S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.015 to 0.12; E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.008 to 0.03; and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.001 to 0.004. Oritavancin MIC QC ranges were, thus, narrow and reproducible. Parameters affecting testing results in the presence of polysorbate 80 were also evaluated. Oritavancin MICs were equivalent to or within 1 doubling dilution of those obtained under standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute testing conditions, regardless of incubation time (18, 24, or 48 h), Ca(2+) concentration, pH, or frozen panel storage time (up to 6 months).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and Etest.
AB  - The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al., Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with >99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.
TI  - A novel transposon, Tn6009, composed of a Tn916 element linked with a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize a novel conjugative transposon Tn6009 composed of a Tn916 linked to a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon in representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated in Nigeria and Portugal. METHODS: Eighty-three Gram-positive and 34 Gram-negative bacteria were screened for the presence of the Tn6009 using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR, hybridization of PCR products, sequencing and mating experiments by established procedures. RESULTS: Forty-three oral and 23 urine Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates carried the Tn6009. Sequencing was performed to verify the direct linkage between the mer resistance genes and the tet(M) gene. A Nigerian Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from a urinary tract infection patient, and one commensal isolate from each of the other Tn6009-positive genera, Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. isolated from the oral and urine samples of healthy Portuguese children, were able to act as donors and conjugally transfer the Tn6009 to the Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 recipient, resulting in tetracycline- and mercury-resistant E. faecalis transconjugants. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a novel non-composite conjugative transposon Tn6009 containing a Tn916 element linked to an S. aureus mer operon carrying genes coding for inorganic mercury resistance (merA), an organic mercury resistance (merB), a regulatory protein (merR) and a mercury transporter (merT). This transposon was identified in 66 isolates from two Gram-positive and three Gram-negative genera and is the first transposon in the Tn916 family to carry the Gram-positive mer genes directly linked to the tet(M) gene.
TI  - Comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (S1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (S2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (S3) to compare microbial changes. METHOD: Twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. Chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% CHX gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [M1: Ca(OH)(2) paste; M2: 2% CHX gel; and M3: Ca(OH)(2) paste plus 2% CHX gel] were used for 7 days. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. Aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS: The species most frequently identified by checkerboard in S1 were: Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, Parvimonas micra and Enterococcus faecalis. In S2 and S3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (E. faecalis). Microorganisms were not identified after use of M2 for 7 days. The quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) CFU/ml in S1, mean CFU was reduced by 99.96% in S2, and there was no statistical difference between the CFU in S2 and S3. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main root canal.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone, against 1,149 recently  collected clinical isolates.
AB  - The activity of DC-159a, a novel orally administered fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution methods against 1,149 recently collected clinical isolates from five continents. Against pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CA-RTIs), the MIC(90)s were 0.12 microg/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015 to 0.03 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03 microg/ml for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 0.12 microg/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci. Similarly, DC-159a was potent against various types of staphylococci (MIC(90) range, 0.03 to 2 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), 4 microg/ml), wild-type isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) range, 0.06 to 2 microg/ml), wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml). Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible organism subsets usually had elevated DC-159a MICs, but the MICs were often two- to fourfold lower than those of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. In conclusion, DC-159a appears to possess a balanced broad spectrum of activity that exceeds the activities of the currently marketed fluoroquinolones, especially against pathogens that cause CA-RTIs.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 18A, Lactobacillus helveticus 2B, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20F, Streptococcus thermophilus 22C, Enterococcus faecalis 32C and Enterococcus durans 16E were the most acidifying strains within 146 isolates for natural whey starters. The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C, 32C and 16E and AMSII: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had a lower level of protein, ash, Ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Emergence of macrolide resistance gene mph(B) in Streptococcus uberis and cooperative effects with rdmC-like gene.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis UCN60 was resistant to spiramycin (MIC = 8 microg/ml) but susceptible to erythromycin (MIC = 0.06 microg/ml), azithromycin (MIC = 0.12 microg/ml), josamycin (MIC = 0.25 microg/ml), and tylosin (MIC = 0.5 microg/ml). A 2.5-kb HindIII fragment was cloned from S. uberis UCN60 DNA on plasmid pUC18 and introduced into Escherichia coli AG100A, where it conferred resistance to spiramycin by inactivation. The sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of an rdmC-like gene that putatively encoded a protein belonging to the alpha/beta hydrolase family and of the first 196 nucleotides of the mph(B) gene putatively encoding a phosphotransferase known to inactivate 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides in E. coli. The entire mph(B) gene was then identified in S. uberis UCN60. The two genes were expressed alone or in combination in E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Analysis of MICs revealed that rdmC-like alone did not confer resistance to erythromycin, tylosin, and josamycin in those three hosts. It conferred resistance to spiramycin in E. coli and E. faecalis but not in S. aureus. mph(B) conferred resistance in E. coli to erythromycin, tylosin, josamycin, and spiramycin but only low levels of resistance in E. faecalis and S. aureus to spiramycin (MIC = 8 microg/ml). The combination of mph(B) and rdmC-like genes resulted in a resistance to spiramycin and tylosin in the three hosts that significantly exceeded the mere addition of the resistance levels conferred by each resistance mechanism alone.
TI  - A study of chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Bulgarian propolis.
AB  - Propolis is a natural product which exhibits pronounced antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. AIM: To analyze the chemical composition and antimicrobial effect of Bulgarian propolis, p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid on certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ethanol extract of Bulgarian propolis (Propolin) and water extract of Bulgarian propolis (Propolstom), ferulic acid and p-cumaric acid were used. The chemical HPLC-analysis of propolis was performed with Varian Prostar system. Microbiological tests were done on isolates of Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. Non-treated and ethanol-treated cultures of the corresponding strains were used as controls. Minimal bactericidal and bacteriostatic concentration of Propolin were determined by agar method. RESULTS: The concentration of p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid in ethanol extract of propolis is about 1%. The minimal bactericidal concentration of Bulgarian propolis against Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus is 281 +/- 89.3 microg/ml, against Enterococcus faecalis--3490 +/- 633.1 microg/ml, against Candida albicans--1375 +/- 255.2 microg/ml, and against Escherichia coli--24306 +/- 1706.4 microg/ml. The minimal bactericidal concentration of p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid against Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus is 212 +/- 6.5 microg/ml and 208 +/- 7.7 microg/ml, against Enterococcus faecalis--3013 +/- 176.6 and 3032 +/- 203.4 microg/ml, against Candida albicans--157 +/- 15.5 microg/ml and 149 +/- 23.2 microg/ml, and against Escherichia coli--798 +/- 7.7 microg/ml and 801 +/- 22.8 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The phenolic compounds p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid are 10 times less extracted in water extraction than in ethanol extraction. The most susceptible strains to the Bulgarian propolis and phenolic compounds are Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus and Candida albicans and the least affected are Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Developmental intestinal aerobic microflora in the kori bustard (Ardeotis kori).
AB  - A study was carried out to investigate the normal aerobic bacterial flora of developing kori bustard (Ardeotis kori) chicks, captive bred at the National Avian Research Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Faecal samples were collected from 14 birds at different ages from the first day of hatching until 99 days old and were cultured for aerobic bacteria. Several bacterial species were isolated from the cultures, they included Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridians, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus spp., Enterobacter, spp. and Serratia marcescens. Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from all but one of the faecal samples collected. They were also the predominant bacteria, accounting for between 55.6 and 73.4% of the mean colony count of faecal cultures from all age groups. E. coli was the most frequently isolated bacteria, the frequency and mean colony count increased as the birds grew older. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from between 50 and 100% of the faecal samples from all age groups, and they accounted for between 26.6 and 44.4% of the mean colony count. Results from this study indicated that Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci can be isolated frequently from the faeces of developing, clinically normal, captive bred kori bustard chicks.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. DATA SOURCES: Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI.
TI  - Lipoprotein signal peptides are processed by Lsp and Eep of Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Lipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) is responsible for cleaving the signal peptide sequence of lipoproteins in gram-positive bacteria. Investigation of the role of Lsp in Streptococcus uberis, a common cause of bovine mastitis, was undertaken using the lipoprotein MtuA (a protein essential for virulence) as a marker. The S. uberis lsp mutant phenotype displayed novel lipoprotein processing. Not only was full-length (uncleaved) MtuA detected by Western blotting, but during late log phase, a lower-molecular-weight derivative of MtuA was evident. Similar analysis of an S. uberis double mutant containing insertions disrupting both lsp and eep (a homologue of the Enterococcus faecalis "enhanced expression of pheromone" gene) indicated a role for eep in cleavage of lipoproteins in the absence of Lsp. Such a function may indicate a role for eep in maintenance of secretion pathways during disruption of normal lipoprotein processing.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect and pH of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  - The purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the pH changes caused by these medications. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.05). The pH of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. The largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% CHX gel, followed by Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel + iodoform, Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel, Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel + zinc oxide, and Ca(OH)2 + water. The mean pH of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for CHX gel (pH=7.0). The results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% CHX gel, followed by its combination with Ca(OH)2 and iodoform.
TI  - Frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of Streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 Streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. Detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types I, II, III and IV were carried out by PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. In addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. There was a high phenotypic diversity; some Streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other Streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (I-IV). There was no positive correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (Spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, P>0.05). In conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.
TI  - Impact of growth conditions on susceptibility of five microbial species to alkaline stress.
AB  - The effects of different growth conditions on the susceptibility of five taxa to  alkaline stress were investigated. Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176, Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 12104, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 were grown as planktonic cells, allowed to adhere to dentin for 24 hours, grown as monospecies or multispecies biofilms on dentin under anaerobic conditions with a serum-enriched nutrient supply at 37 degrees C for 5 days. In addition, suspended biofilm microorganisms and 5-day old planktonic multispecies cultures were used. Microbial recovery upon direct exposure to saturated calcium hydroxide solution (pH 12.5) for 10 and 100 minutes was compared with control exposure to physiologic saline. Planktonic microorganisms were most susceptible; only E. faecalis and C. albicans survived in saturated solution for 10 minutes, the latter also for 100 minutes. Dentin adhesion was the major factor in improving the resistance of E. faecalis and A. naeslundii to calcium hydroxide, whereas the multispecies context in a biofilm was the major factor in promoting resistance of S. sobrinus to the disinfectant. In contrast, the C. albicans response to calcium hydroxide was not influenced by the growth condition. Adherence to dentin and interspecies interactions in a biofilm appear to differentially affect the sensitivity of microbial species to calcium hydroxide.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance gene transfer between Streptococcus gordonii and Enterococcus faecalis in root canals of teeth ex vivo.
AB  - Multiple bacterial species coexisting in infected root canals might interact, but evidence for interspecies gene transfer is lacking. This study tested the hypothesis that horizontal exchange of antibiotic resistance can occur between different bacterial species in root canals. Transfer of the conjugative plasmid pAM81 carrying erythromycin resistance between 2 endodontic infection-associated species, Streptococcus gordonii and Enterococcus faecalis, was investigated in an ex vivo tooth model. Equal numbers of each species (one with pAM81 and the other plasmid-free) were combined in prepared root canals of sterilized teeth and incubated at 37 degrees C. At 24 and 72 hours, bidirectional interspecies antibiotic resistance gene transfer was evident in microorganisms recovered from teeth; average transfer frequencies from S. gordonii to E. faecalis were 10(-3) transconjugants per donor and from E. faecalis to S. gordonii were 10(-6) and 10(-7) transconjugants per donor at 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Microbial accumulations were observed on root canal walls with scanning electron microscopy. Horizontal genetic exchange in endodontic infections might facilitate adoption of an optimal genetic profile for survival.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against recent Gram-positive clinical isolates: results of the 2004-05 Prospective European Surveillance Initiative.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of serious infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline prospective assessment of its in vitro activity against a large and diverse collection of Gram-positive clinical isolates from Europe and Israel. METHODS: Gram-positive clinical isolates, collected between October 2004 and December 2005 from 36 hospital laboratories in 15 countries, were tested by broth microdilution using CLSI methodology. RESULTS: In total, 3206 isolates were collected. Telavancin had potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC range < or =0.015 to 2 mg/L), independent of resistance to methicillin or to multiple drugs. Telavancin had particularly strong activity against streptococcal isolates (MIC range < or =0.001 to 0.5 mg/L), including penicillin-resistant and multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and erythromycin non-susceptible beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. Telavancin also had excellent activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L), and although its MICs were elevated against VanA strains (Enterococcus faecalis MIC(90) 8 mg/L and Enterococcus faecium MIC(90) 4 mg/L), its MIC(90) was substantially lower than observed with available glycopeptides. CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin has potent in vitro activity against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates from diverse geographic areas in Europe and Israel.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Bacterial infections in pigs experimentally infected with Nipah virus.
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV; Paramyxoviridae) caused fatal encephalitis in humans during an  outbreak in Malaysia in 1998/1999 after transmission from infected pigs. Our previous study demonstrated that the respiratory, lymphatic and central nervous systems are targets for virus replication in experimentally infected pigs. To continue the studies on pathogenesis of NiV in swine, six piglets were inoculated oronasally with 2.5 x 10(5) PFU per animal. Four pigs developed mild clinical signs, one exudative epidermitis, and one neurologic signs due to suppurative meningoencephalitis, and was euthanized at 11 days post-inoculation (dpi). Neutralizing antibodies reached in surviving animals titers around 1280 at 16 dpi. Nasal and oro-pharyngeal shedding of the NiV was detected between 2 and 17 dpi. Virus appeared to be cleared from the tissues of the infected animals by 23 dpi, with low amount of RNA detected in submandibular and bronchial lymph nodes of three pigs, and olfactory bulb of one animal. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, virus was isolated from serum at 24 dpi, and the viral RNA was still detected in serum at 29 dpi. Our results indicate slower clearance of NiV from some of the infected pigs. Bacteria were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of five NiV inoculated animals, with isolation of Streptococcus suis and Enterococcus faecalis. Staphylococcus hyicus was isolated from the skin lesions of the animal with exudative epidermitis. Along with the observed lymphoid depletion in the lymph nodes of all NiV-infected animals, and the demonstrated ability of NiV to infect porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, this finding warrants further investigation into a possible NiV-induced immunosuppression of the swine host.
TI  - Relationship of vaginal microflora to PROM, pPROM and the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are among the most frequent causes of premature delivery and premature discharges of amniotic fluid. The vaginal ecosystem significantly contributes to the development of these conditions. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) are associated with an increased risk of intra-amniotic infection. The intra-amniotic infection negatively affects perinatal morbidity and mortality of newborns. OBJECTIVES: Finding of relationship of vaginal microflora to PROM, pPROM and the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A prospective study was implemented in 152 women with singleton gestations with PROM (n=52) and pPROM (n=47); the control group included 53 women with physiologic pregnancy and delivery at normal term without PROM. In all the women, aerobic cultivations from the vagina and cervix for Chlamydia trachomatis were provided before initiation of antibiotic treatment, the microbial picture of vagina was examined, and the cultivation examination of urine was carried out. The placenta was subjected to histopathologic examination. For the diagnosis of early-onset sepsis, we used concentrations of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, from the venous umbilical blood taken immediately after delivery and cutting of the umbilical cord. Demonstrated early neonatal sepsis served as a further criterion. RESULTS: The most frequent bacteriologic findings throughout the group were coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Ureaplasma, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus viridans. Women with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection or diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. We found no statistically significant relationship between a specific bacterial strain and PROM and pPROM. We found a statistically significant association between the risk for intra-amniotic infection and the finding of S. viridans (p<0.001). There was also a statistically significant relationship between the microbiologic picture of the vagina VI and infection risk (p<0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Based on results of the present study, it is clear that the use of cultivation and microscopic findings in the vagina and cervix for the timely diagnosis of the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis is restricted.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  - Culture-based studies have shown that Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (RC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the bacterial diversity of RC in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. Plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no RC and from 11 subjects with RC. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. From a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. The majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. Species of Selenomonas and Veillonella were common in all samples. The healthy microbiota included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia spp., Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus cristatus, and Kingella oralis. Lactobacilli were absent, S. mutans was present in one, and Actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. In contrast, the microbiota of the RC subjects was dominated by Actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, S. mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Selenomonas sp. clone CS002, Atopobium and Olsenella spp., Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Propionibacterium sp. strain FMA5. The bacterial profiles of RC showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. The data suggest that putative etiological agents of RC include not only S. mutans, lactobacilli, and Actinomyces but also species of Atopobium, Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Propionibacterium, and Selenomonas.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - Pediatric endocarditis and stroke: a single-center retrospective review of seven  cases.
AB  - The acute management of strokes in children with infective endocarditis is limited by the paucity of published data on their clinical course and outcomes. Our retrospective study at an urban tertiary-care academic center characterized the clinical course of seven pediatric patients with endocarditis and subsequent cerebral infarcts. Among 115 patients with endocarditis, a stroke occurred in seven. Four patients manifested congenital heart disease. In six patients, the stroke occurred in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, with no preference for the left or right hemisphere. The most common presenting sign was focal weakness. Three patients manifested mycotic aneurysms, all of which were successfully repaired. Two patients received aspirin therapy, with no adverse effects. All patients survived, but neurologic recovery was variable. The two youngest patients (aged 3 and 14 weeks) demonstrated the longest periods of hospitalization, with the most severe neurologic impairment. These findings suggest that children may have better outcomes than adults after a stroke secondary to bacterial endocarditis. Routine surveillance for mycotic aneurysms in patients with new neurologic deficits, and the use of aspirin, should be considered in the medical management.
TI  - [Antibiotics susceptibility of Streptococcus and Enterococcus: data of Onerba network].
AB  - This work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae), or in animals (Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Data were recorded since 1996 through the Onerba networks. S. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in S. pyogenes. In 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. A similar trend was observed for S. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals S. suis and S. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. In enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. Indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in E. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of E. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. From 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in French hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. However, the recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in French hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. Such trend in macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes or S. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of the conserved hypothetical protein HP0892 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0892 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25552) is a 90-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695, with a calculated pI of 9.38 and a molecular mass of 10.41 kDa. It belongs to the Plasmid stabilization system protein family (PF05016) in the Pfam database. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0892 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0892 using multidimentional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. About 97.0% (422/ 435) of the HN, N, CO, C Alpha , C Beta resonances of 90 residues of HP0892 were assigned. On the basis of the resonance assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0892, and will be useful for studying its interaction with other molecules.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Infection after the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: evaluation of the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on clinical outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with infection after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although previous studies have evaluated this postoperative complication, no studies to date have looked at the impact of this complication on both radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: From 1986 to 2004, 236 patients were identified who underwent surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and had at least 2-year follow-up. The medical records of patients who developed infection were retrospectively reviewed in detail. Preoperative and most recent postoperative radiographic parameters and Scoliosis Research Society 24 outcomes of both infected and noninfected patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 236 patients 7 (3%) developed an infection. One was acute (17 days postoperative), and 6 were delayed (average 34.2 months postoperative). The most common presenting complaints included back pain (5 of 7) and localized swelling (4 of 7). All patients with delayed infection were treated with 1 surgery (irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal) and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Of 6 patients 3 had pseudarthrosis. Culture results were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Group A Streptococcus (n = 1), no growth (n = 1). The patient with acute infection required 6 surgical procedures and 16 weeks of antibiotics. Cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marscesens. Revision fusion surgery was performed 5 months after the infection was treated. Compared with the noninfected patients, those with infection had lower percent thoracic (P = 0.01) and lumbar (P = 0.06) curve correction. There was no difference in the pain, function, self-image, satisfaction, or total Scoliosis Research Society 24 scores. CONCLUSION: Postoperative infection after the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis can successfully be treated with irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal, and a course of antibiotics. Although less curve correction was achieved in the infected group, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes when compared with the noninfected group.
TI  - Clinical significance of nontraditional bacterial uropathogens in the management  of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the clinical benefits of eradicating traditional accepted uropathogens and nontraditional uropathogens (gram-positive bacteria other than enterococci) in prostate specific specimens in men with clinical prostatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men with prostatitis-like symptoms and any bacteria localized to prostate specific specimens were treated with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks with 6 months of followup. Rates of bacterial eradication and clinical responses in group 1, who had uropathogenic localization (eg Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis), were compared to those in group 2, who had bacteria considered nonuropathogens (eg coagulase negative Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species). RESULTS: Of the men 261, including 146 in group 1 and 115 in group 2, were available for analyses. Mean age was 51.3 years and mean symptom duration was 8.4 weeks (median 3.5). Of the patients 107 (41%) had received previous antibiotic treatment. Bacteria eradication rates were similar in groups 1 and 2 (74.0% and 78.3%, respectively, p = 0.47). Clinical response rates were also similar in groups 1 and 2 (76.6% and 70.4%, respectively, p = 0.26). In groups 1 and 2 there was a statistically significant correlation between clinical and microbiological outcomes (chi-square analysis correlation p = 0.0014 and 0.0055, respectively). At 6 months of followup 70.5% of successfully treated group 1 patients were still considered to have a positive clinical response compared to 72.8% in group 2 (p = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically acceptable short and long-term microbiological and clinical responses to fluoroquinolone therapy for clinical prostatitis did not depend on whether traditional uropathogenic bacteria or nontraditional uropathogens were isolated in prostate specific specimens.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Terpenoids Produced by Actinomycetes: Napyradiomycins from Streptomyces antimycoticus NT17.
AB  - Napyradiomycin SR ( 1), 16-dechloro-16-hydroxynapyradiomycin C2 ( 2), 18-hydroxynapyradiomycin A1 ( 3), 18-oxonapyradiomycin A1 ( 4), 16-oxonapyradiomycin A2 ( 5), 7-demethyl SF2415A3 ( 6), 7-demethyl A80915B ( 7), and ( R)-3-chloro-6-hydroxy-8-methoxy-alpha-lapachone ( 8) were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces antimycoticus NT17. These compounds are derivatives of the napyradiomycins isolated previously from Chainia rubra or Streptomyces aculeolatus. The structures of the new compounds, some of which exhibit antibacterial activities, were established by comparing their NMR data with data of related known compounds. The unique structure of 1, containing a highly strained ring, was established by NMR and was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Two of the compounds are C-16 stereoisomers of napyradiomycin A2 and are named napyradiomycins A2a ( 9a) and A2b ( 9b).
TI  - Secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. Antibacterial protection is provided in part by Paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. The mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with Crohn's ileitis. In the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying mucus and the luminal content. METHODS: Preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. RESULTS: The secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. The extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for Listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); Enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); Bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); Streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); Escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). A spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. CONCLUSION: These findings show that secreted antimicrobial peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. This distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Bacterial and Candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3D-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  - Rapid prototyping (RP)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. Microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. Consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on RP-produced scaffolds. This research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3D-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. Tricalciumphosphate (TCP), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. Six oral bacterial strains, one Candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. The number of colony forming units (CFU) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were performed. Microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. All strains, except for Streptococcus oralis, adhered best to PLGA scaffolds. Streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis adhered best to PLGA scaffolds, followed by alginate and TCP. Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Candida albicans showed the highest adherence to PLGA, followed by TCP and alginate. In contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to TCP, followed by PLGA and alginate. SEM observations correlated with the results of the CFU determinations. CLSM detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. In conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. Strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral pathogens are discussed.
TI  - Pyopericardium due to group D streptococcus.
AB  - Beta-hemolytic Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from the pericardial fluid obtained from a patient with pyopericardium. The patient was immunocompetent and had mild pleural effusion. He was treated with parenteral co-amoxiclav and amikacin, had underwent pericardiectomy with repeated pericardial aspiration, and recovered completely. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pyopericardium due to E. faecalis .
TI  - Linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  - Linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. With regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. Clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA, VRE bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. We anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as VRE- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. Some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.
TI  - Coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and amalgam. There were 108 single-rooted teeth randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either Diaket (3M/ESPE, Seefeld, Germany), AH Plus (Dentsply, De Trey, Konstanz, Germany), or Ketac Endo (3M/ESPE). These groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either MTA or zinc-free amalgam. The samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. Leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. The least leakage was found in a combination of Diaket and MTA (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by AH Plus and MTA (66.1 +/- 18.7), Diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), AH Plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and Ketac Endo and MTA (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the Ketac Endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). Samples filled with MTA showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p < 0.05).
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria from poultry feces: evidence on anti-campylobacter and anti-listeria activities.
AB  - Forty-five strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from poultry feces sampled from an industrial farm located in the Nantes area (France), and most of them belong to the Streptococcus or Lactobacillus genus according to the results obtained by Galerie API and molecular methods. The most representative lactic acid bacteria strains were screened for antibacterial compound production against 2 indicator organisms (Listeria innocua F and Campylobacter jejuni 11168) by means of the agar diffusion test. Strain S37, identified as Enterococcus faecalis, exhibited a clear anti-listerial activity and a slight anti-Campylobacter activity, whereas strain S42, identified as Lactobacillus reuteri, exhibited only anti-Campylobacter activity. Regarding the results of proteolytic, heat, and neutralizing treatments of supernatants from the aforementioned strains, we can conclude that antagonism observed is attributed to antimicrobial peptide or bacteriocin in the case of strain S37, whereas it is ascribable to a nonbacteriocin, likely a reuterin, in the case of strain S42.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ertapenem against strains isolated from diabetic foot infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial strains isolated from diabetic foot infections (DFI). METHODOLOGY: All diabetic patients hospitalized for a first episode of DFI (stages 2 to 4, according to the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot Classification) were selected in the Nimes University hospital between January 2005 to December 2005. MICs were determined using both E-test strips and dilution methods on bacterial strains isolated from foot samples. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two bacteria (154 Gram-positive cocci including 94 Staphylococcus aureus, 80 Gram-negative bacilli with 56 Enterobacteriaceae, and 18 anaerobes) were studied. Ertapenem was active against all Streptococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, and also against 89.8% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. However, this antibiotic was active only against 31.5% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 21.8% of Enterococcus faecalis, and 15.8% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ertapenem may be a useful agent to treat patients suffering from DFI after bacterial identification.

TI  - Crystal structure of the YdjC-family protein TTHB029 from Thermus thermophilus HB8: structural relationship with peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase.
AB  - The YdjC-family protein is widely distributed, from human to bacteria, but so far no three-dimensional structure and functional analysis of this family of proteins has been reported. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the YdjC homolog TTHB029 at a resolution of 2.9A. The overall structure of the monomer consists of (betaalpha)-barrel fold forming a homodimer. Asp21, His60, and His127 residues coordinate to Mg(2+) as a possible active site. TTHB029 shows structural similarity to the peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpPgdA). The active site groove of SpPgdA includes the Zn(2+) coordinated to Asp276, His326, and His330. Despite the low sequence identity, metal-binding residues of Asp-His-His were conserved among the two enzymes. There were definitive differences, however, in that one of the histidines of the metal-binding site was substituted for the other histidine located on the other loop. Moreover, these important metal-binding residues and the residues of the presumed active site are fully conserved in YdjC-family protein.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - [Etiology and results of treatment of adults with bacterial encephalomeningitis].
AB  - Results of treatment and outcomes of 89 adults with purulent encephalomeningitis, treated in years 1996-2002 in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, Medical University of Lodz, were analyzed. Eighty nine patients were retrospectively included into the study. Results of treatment were evaluated at the last day of patient's hospitalization, and classified as: cure, disability or death. Results of treatment were analyzed in relation to etiology of purulent encephalomeningitis, age and gender of patients, course of the disease, and time from the onset of symptoms to admission to the Department. No statistically significant correlations between age, gender and prognosis were found. Thirty seven out of 89 patients were cured (41.6%); 29 of 89 patients died (32.6%); in 18 patients (19/89; 20.2) disability was diagnosed. In remaining 5 cases (5.6%), the result of treatment remained unknown. These patients were transferred to Intensive Care Units, outside our Hospital. In the studied group, etiologic factor was identified in 40 out of 89 cases (44.9%). In 40 patients, positive results of bacterial examination of cerebrospinal fluid were achieved. In 22 out of these 40 cases (55.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified as the etiologic factor. Higher percentage of patients died in subgroup with known etiology than in in subgroup of unknown etiology (p = 0.02). Higher percentage of cases with unconsciousness and higher percentage of cases with respiratory insufficiency were diagnosed in patients who died, than in patients who were cured (p = 0.00001). CONCLUSION: 1. Purulent meningoencephalitis in adults, despite progress in antibiotic treatment, is still a serious condition, with poor prognosis. 2. Diagnostics and treatment modalities of purulent meningo-encephalitis should be urgently extended in order to achieve better outcomes in these group of patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis sample were used. The storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPRT). Refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPR). To perform the immediate effect analysis (GPi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although GPR, iodoform, Rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees C average temperature. The testing methodology was Dilution in Solid Medium-Agar. The Wilcoxon Test and Friedman variance analyses were used. RESULTS: The GP paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. CONCLUSION: The pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.

TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Piper guineense 'Uziza' and Phyllantus amarus 'Ebe-benizo' on Candida albicans and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Two pathogens were employed, Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans for the  study of the antimicrobial effects of Piper guineense and Phyllantus amarus using agar-well diffusion and disc-diffusion methods. Phytochemical screening of ethanol, cold and hot water extracts detected the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids and phlobatannins. Antimicrobial effect of the plant extracts showed that the organic solvent and aqueous solvents of P. amarus were inhibitory to S. faecalis while the extracts of Phyllantus amarus were not inhibitory to Candida albicans. Agar-well determined Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values ranged between 3.125 mg/ml and 6.25 mg/ml while the disc diffusion determined MIC values ranged between 6.25 mg/ml and 25.0 mg/ml. The agar-well determined MIC values for the ethanolic P. amarus extracts (3.12 mg/ml) were lower than the corresponding disc-diffusion MIC determined values (6.25 mg/ml-25.00 mg/ml). Bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effect varied with, solvent type of extract, concentration of the plant extract and the method of the test adopted. The active components of the plant have no antifungal effect on the tested yeast (Candida albicans). These findings are discussed in relation to plant chemicals as a means of disease control and also to the problem of microbial resistance to synthetic drugs.
TI  - Effect of photo-activated disinfection on endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  - AIM: To test the hypothesis that photo-activated disinfection (PAD) has a bactericidal effect on pathogens inoculated in root canals, with emphasis on biofilm formation/destruction. METHODOLOGY: Root canals of extracted teeth (n = 38) were prepared (size 30, 0.10 taper), autoclaved, divided into three groups and two negative controls inoculated (Streptococcus anginosus, Enterococcus faecalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum) and treated (PAD, laser, dye or positive control) according to a cross-sectional design. Resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of cell structural changes using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentinal surfaces (n = 22, two controls) before (1, 2 and 6 days of incubation) and after treatment with PAD. RESULTS: Treatment of root canals with PAD (15 J) caused a significant reduction of the bacterial load, resulting in a 93.8% kill of S. anginosus (P < 0.0001), a 88.4% kill of E. faecalis (P < 0.05) and a 98.5% kill of F. nucleatum (P < 0.0001), but no sterilization. Laser alone had no significant effect on the load nor did the dye without laser. The ESEM experiment showed that individual cells or monolayers were easily eliminated with PAD. But when biofilms were present (2 and 6 days for E. faecalis, 6 days for S. anginosus), bacterial eradication was substantially reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: Photo-activated disinfection is not an alternative but a possible supplement to the existing protocols for root canal disinfection as the interaction between light (diode laser) and associated dye (TBO) provides a broad-spectrum effect. Some endodontic pathogens that grow as single-species biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  - Triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from Miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. All the isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. Ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with MIC values ranging from 30 microg/mL to 80 microg/mL. The MIC values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. With regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.
TI  - Effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of Enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  - This in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of Enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of E. faecalis to dentin. The ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. Fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. Results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than E. faecalis. The hydrophobicity of E. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). The adherence of E. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. It was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of E. faecalis to dentin. The findings from this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - This review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. In general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. Several circular antibacterial peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin AS-48, from Enterococcus faecalis S-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin A, from Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from Lactobacillus reuteri LA6, butyrivibriocin AR10, from the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens AR10, uberolysin, from Streptococcus uberis, circularin A, from Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 25752, and subtilosin A, from Bacillus subtilis. We summarize here the progress made in the understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - A genome-wide survey of short coding sequences in streptococci.
AB  - Identification of short genes that encode peptides of fewer than 60 aa is challenging, both experimentally and in silico. As a consequence, the universe of these short coding sequences (CDSs) remains largely unknown, although some are acknowledged to play important roles in cell-cell communication, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. This paper reports a thorough search for short CDSs across streptococcal genomes. Our bioinformatic approach relied on a combination of advanced intrinsic and extrinsic methods. In the first step, intrinsic sequence information (nucleotide composition and presence of RBSs) served to identify new short putative CDSs (spCDSs) and to eliminate the differences between annotation policies. In the second step, pseudogene fragments and false predictions were filtered out. The last step consisted of screening the remaining spCDSs for lines of extrinsic evidence involving sequence and gene-context comparisons. A total of 789 spCDSs across 20 complete genomes (19 Streptococcus and one Enterococcus) received the support of at least one line of extrinsic evidence, which corresponds to an average of 20 short CDSs per million base pairs. Most of these had no known function, and a significant fraction (31%) are not even annotated as hypothetical genes in GenBank records. As an illustration of the value of this list, we describe a new family of CDSs, encoding very short hydrophobic peptides (20-23 aa) situated just upstream of some of the positive transcriptional regulators of the Rgg family. The expression of seven other short CDSs from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066 that encode peptides ranging in length from 41 to 56 aa was confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and revealed a variety of expression patterns. Finally, one peptide from this list, encoded by a gene that is not annotated in GenBank, was identified in a cell-envelope-enriched fraction of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of RWJ-54428 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (also known as MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with promising activity against gram-positive bacteria. The pharmacodynamics (PDs) of RWJ-54428 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis were studied in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. The RWJ-54428 MICs ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/liter. Mice with ca. 10(6) CFU/thigh at the initiation of therapy were treated intraperitoneally with RWJ-54428 at doses that ranged from 3 to 1,200 mg/kg of body weight/day (in 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 divided doses) for 24 h. The maximal reductions in bacterial counts in thigh tissues at 24 h for the methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis strains were -2.8, -3.8, and -1.7 log10 CFU/thigh, respectively. The percentage of a 24-h dosing interval that the unbound serum RWJ-54428 concentrations exceeded the MIC (fT>MIC) was the pharmacokinetic (PK)-PD parameter that best described the efficacy of RWJ-54428. The fT>MICs for a bacteriostatic effect (no net change in the numbers of CFU/thigh over 24 h) ranged from 14 to 20% for staphylococci and streptococci; for maximal reductions in the numbers of CFU/thigh, the fT>MICs ranged from 22 to 36% for these strains. For E. faecalis, the ranges of fT>MICs for static and maximal effects were 30 to 46% and 55 to 60%, respectively. These data show that treatment with RWJ-54428 results in marked antibacterial effects in vivo, with the PK-PD parameters for efficacy being comparable to those for the efficacy of penicillins and carbapenems active against staphylococci and pneumococci.
TI  - Postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. Despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. However, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. METHODS: To evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between January 2000 and December 2004. For patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. RESULTS: A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). Sixty patients (78.9%) experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. A microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. Pathogens responsible for the infections were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group B Streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable Streptococcus organisms (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Haemophilus spp. (n = 9), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 4). According to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. Evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive LAB and bifidobacteria (BF) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. The LAB and BF isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on SDS-PAGE protein profile analysis of whole cells. Furthermore, partial 16S rDNA sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. The identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus (78.8%), seven species to the genus Bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus Enterococcus (11.6%), one species of Streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of Pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). In particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were L. reuteri, L. animalis, and L. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. Besides these, Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. The sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the DDBJ and the similarity was above 97.2%. Their partial 16S rRNA genes were registered in the DDBJ.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Controlled release of vancomycin from cross-linked gelatine.
AB  - This paper explores the possibility of using biodegradable cross-linked gelatines as antibiotic devices for a long-term elution (80 days). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has been utilized to evaluate the mass percentage of vancomycin and gelatine contemporary released from differently cross-linked vancomycin loaded gelatine samples in an elution time ranging from 24 to 1920 h. While the solubilization kinetic of gelatine samples differently cross-linked can be very close described by the simplified Higuchi model, the vancomycin release kinetic is contemporary governed by both the Fickian diffusion process trough the gelatine matrix network and the dissolution process of the matrix due to its degradation. Comparing the antibiotic eluting kinetics from gelatine at diverse cross-linking degree we observed that the degradation of the proteic matrix appears to have a minor influence in the drug release control. Vancomycin released from all the gelatine partially cross-linked samples results active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis which represent the most pathogens commonly isolated in orthopaedic infections. Vancomycin overcomes the minimum inhibitory concentration for both the bacteria in the whole range of elution time. Cross-linked gelatine devices appear to represent a useful biodegradable delivery system for local anti-infective therapy in arthoplasty.
TI  - Surface antibacterial properties of glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) is recommended for use worldwide, not only in developing countries where resources are not readily available, but also in more industrialized countries. The antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials may improve the restorative treatment outcome. Glass ionomer cement (GIC) has been advocated as the preferred restoration material for ART. The authors evaluated the antibacterial properties of restorative materials-three GICs and a zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE)-in vitro. METHODS: Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis were the test microorganisms. The authors used a quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assay to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the restorative materials using the direct contact test (DCT) of freshly prepared and one-week-aged materials. RESULTS: The freshly prepared GICs and ZOE showed no bacterial growth in all tested bacteria compared with a control. This effect lasted for at least one week for S. mutans and A. viscosus but not for E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional GICs used in ART showed antibacterial surface properties against cariogenic bacteria for at least one week. Further study on the long-term antimicrobial effects of GICs is needed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The antimicrobial properties of freshly prepared restorative materials and aged restorative materials used in ART have a potent effect against cariogenic bacteria. These properties have crucial importance in preventing secondary caries.
TI  - ef1097 and ypkK encode enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK, members of a new family of antimicrobial proteins (bacteriocins) with modular structure from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Unlike the colicins, microcins and related peptide antibiotics, little is known about antibiotic proteins (M(r)>10,000) from Gram-positive bacteria, since only few examples have been described to date. In this study we used heterologous expression of recombinant proteins to access the 17 kDa antibiotic protein SA-M57 from Streptococcus pyogenes, along with two proteins of unknown function identified in publicly available databases: EF1097 from Enterococcus faecalis and YpkK from Corynebacterium jeikeium. Here we show that all three are antibiotic proteins with different spectra of antimicrobial activity that kill sensitive bacteria at nanomolar concentrations. In silico structure predictions indicate that although the three proteins share little sequence similarity, they may be composed of conserved secondary structural elements: a relatively unstructured, acidic N-terminal portion and a basic C-terminal portion characterized by two helical elements separated by a loop structure and stabilized by an essential disulphide. Expression of individual segments as well as protein chimaeras revealed that, at least in the case of YpkK, the C-terminal portion is responsible for the killing action of the protein, whereas the role of the N-terminal portion remains unclear. Both scnM57 and ef1097 appear to be widely distributed in Strep. pyogenes and Ent. faecalis (respectively), whereas ypkK is found only rarely amongst clinical isolates of C. jeikeium. Finally, we determined that the proteins kill sensitive bacteria without lysis, a feature that distinguishes them from known murolytic proteins.
TI  - Antibody binding to Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis cell fractions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine which cell fraction(s) of Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 serve as the best source of antigens recognized by salivary SIgA antibodies in infants. DESIGN: Whole cells of 38 reference and wild-type isolates of S. mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus faecalis were fractionated into cell walls (CW), protease-treated cell walls (PTCW), cell membranes (CM) and cell protein (CP). Whole cells and these fractions were tested for binding by rabbit anti-S. mitis SK145 and anti-S. oralis SK100 sera, and also by salivary SIgA antibodies from infants and adults. RESULTS: Anti-SK145 and anti-SK100 sera bound whole cells and fractions of all strains of S. mitis and S. oralis variably. Cluster analysis of antibody binding data placed the strains into S. mitis, S. oralis and 'non-S. mitis/non-S. oralis' clusters. Antigens from CW and CM best discriminated S. mitis from S. oralis. CM bound the most infant salivary SIgA antibody and PTCW bound the least. In contrast, adult salivary SIgA antibody bound all of the cell fractions and at higher levels. CONCLUSIONS: Presumably the relatively short period of immune stimulation and immunological immaturity in infants, in contrast to adults, result in low levels of salivary SIgA antibody that preferentially bind CM of S. mitis but not PTCW. By utilizing isolated cell walls and membranes as sources of antigens for proteomics it may be possible to identify antigens common to oral streptococci and dissect the fine specificity of salivary SIgA antibodies induced by oral colonization by S. mitis.
TI  - Characterization of the organ donor with bacteremia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The presence of bloodstream infection in the donor is a common finding that could be transmitted to the recipient. To safely expand the donor pool, we examined its relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We described the clinical characteristics of organ donors grafted in our center between 1997 and 2006 who had bacteremia detected in blood cultures obtained during organ procurement. RESULTS: Among 1353 organ donors, 75 were non-heart-beating donors type II and the others brain-dead donors. Only 186 donors (14%) showed bacteremia during retrieval. This mean age was 49.8 years (range 12 to 86 years, SD 18) including 63% men. Causes of death were cerebrovascular accident in 60%; craneoencephalic trauma, 25%; and other causes, 15%. The average length of the intensive care unit stay was 3 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days). Twenty-nine percent of donors presented previous infectious complications (90% from respiratory origin). The most prevalent pathogen isolated in blood cultures was coagulase negative Staphylococci (46,2%), followed by S aureus (15%), Streptococcus group viridans (9.1%), enterobacteria (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (7.5%) and gram-negative bacilli nonfermentative (6.2%). In 3.1%, the bloodstream infections were polymicrobial. The bronchial aspiration cultures were positive in 50% of cases and the urine culture in 8,6%. In 17% of donors the isolated microorganism was coincident between blood and bronchial cultures. Pseudomonas spp and S aureus were more common than the others (P = .004 and P = .058, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of bacteremia in our cohort was 14%. The respiratory tract was the most common clinical focus. Pseudomonas spp or S aureus isolated in bronchial cultures are risk factors to develop bacteremia. According to these findings, it is important to start specific antibiotics against those microorganisms in the donor and the recipients.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. Like Escherichia coli, the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids. In E. coli UFA synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by fabA and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabB. S. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with only an isomerase function encoded by the fabM gene. In this paper we report the construction and characterization of an S. pneumoniae 708 fabM mutant. This mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition of UFAs to the growth medium. S. pneumoniae fabM mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. We also demonstrate that a fabM null mutant of the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutants is a UFA auxotroph, indicating that FabM is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. Finally we report that the fabN gene of Enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of S. pneumoniae fabM mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that FabM is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that S. pneumoniae UFA auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in UFA biosynthesis.
TI  - [Species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated RAISUS using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. A single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. The cell suspension to the RAISUS was properly prepared to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. When the five ATCC reference strains, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247. The results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those MICs obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant MICs for certain antimicrobial agents. The significant discrepancy in MIC determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. Through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18S to 20S of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90S of the tests. With these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by RAISUS, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. Also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of RAISUS test function.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis constitutes an unusual bacterial model in lysozyme resistance.
AB  - Lysozyme is an important and widespread compound of the host constitutive defense system, and it is assumed that Enterococcus faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are almost completely lysozyme resistant. On the basis of the sequence analysis of the whole genome of E. faecalis V583 strain, we identified two genes that are potentially involved in lysozyme resistance, EF_0783 and EF_1843. Protein products of these two genes share significant homology with Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase (OatA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (PgdA), respectively. In order to determine whether EF_0783 and EF_1843 are involved in lysozyme resistance, we constructed their corresponding mutants and a double mutant. The DeltaEF_0783 mutant and DeltaEF_0783 DeltaEF_1843 double mutant were shown to be more sensitive to lysozyme than the parental E. faecalis JH2-2 strain and DeltaEF_1843 mutant were. However, compared to other bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes or S. pneumoniae, the tolerance of DeltaEF_0783 and DeltaEF_0783 DeltaEF_1843 mutants towards lysozyme remains very high. Peptidoglycan structure analysis showed that EF_0783 modifies the peptidoglycan by O acetylation of N-acetyl muramic acid, while the EF_1843 deletion has no obvious effect on peptidoglycan structure under the same conditions. Moreover, the EF_0783 and EF_1843 deletions seem to significantly affect the ability of E. faecalis to survive within murine macrophages. In all, while EF_0783 is currently involved in the lysozyme resistance of E. faecalis, peptidoglycan O acetylation and de-N-acetylation are not the main mechanisms conferring high levels of lysozyme resistance to E. faecalis.
TI  - Penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  - The authors topically administered gatifloxacin (GFLX) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. Seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 0.3% GFLX ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for GFLX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean intraoperative GFLX concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/mL. GFLX level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/mL in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/mL) in the patients less than 70 years old. This concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (MIC90), such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) in vitro. The GFLX concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA in vitro.
TI  - LEADER surveillance program results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from the United States (50 medical centers).
AB  - Surveillance for emerging linezolid resistance among commonly occurring Gram-positive pathogens in the United States began with the 2002 ZAAPS program and more recently (2004) expanded as the LEADER program. The 2006 LEADER program processed 5374 strains from 50 medical centers (100 per site) located within the 9 US census regions; species and number tested by broth microdilution (% linezolid susceptible) included Staphylococcus aureus (2913, >99.9), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNSs) (808, 98.4), enterococci (547, 97.4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (546, 100.0), viridans group streptococci (189, 100.0), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (371, 100.0). In addition to 1 linezolid-nonsusceptible S. aureus, 3 strains were daptomycin-nonsusceptible, 4 were quinupristin/dalfopristin-intermediate, 2 were vancomycin-intermediate (vancomycin MIC values, 4 mug/mL), and all were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among the linezolid-resistant isolates (1 S. aureus, 13 CoNSs, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates), all but 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates had the G2567T mutation. Overall, 99.55% of the tested 2006 LEADER program isolates remained susceptible to linezolid at current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints.
TI  - Infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many patients with IE complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. Indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. In a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. Only 9 (25%) were caused by Streptococcus viridans and the remainder by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. Usually more than 50% of all cases of IE were caused by Streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.
TI  - QSAR studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III.
AB  - Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. Components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. FabH, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of FabH and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli, which demonstrate FabH inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. The QSAR studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus). On the other side presence of hetero-atoms like N, O, or S at R(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. The comparison of QSAR between the FabH inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, N. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.
TI  - A distal methyl substituent attenuates mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition in oxazolidinone antibacterials.
AB  - Oxazolidinone analogs bearing substituted piperidine or azetidine C-rings are described. Analogs with a methyl group at the 3-position of the azetidine ring or the 4-position of the piperidine ring exhibited reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition while retaining good antibacterial potency.
TI  - Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients treated in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz, Poland, 2000-2001.
AB  - Background. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the occurrence of Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at the Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz. Materials and methods. The material analyzed consisted of 533 clinical samples collected from patients hospitalized in 2000-2001. The study included 485 Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from clinical material. Morphological characteristics provided the basis for the identification of bacteria. The species were identified by using API 20 STREP and API STAPH tests (bioMerieux). The isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method. Results. The most often isolated bacteria were Enterococcus spp. (46,8%) and Staphylococcus spp. (31,5%), followed by Corynebacterium spp. (9,1%) and Streptococcus spp. (6,6%). The most frequently identified Enterococcus species were E. faecalis (92,9%) and E. faecium (7,1%). All the Enterococcus strains were susceptible to glycopeptides. More than 90% of the Enterococus isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoine, about 44% to high concentrations of gentamycin, 17,9% to ciprofloxacin. During this period, and S. simulans, and 21 strains of S. auerus (46,7%). 92% of all the tested CNS strains (80%) than in the S. aureus isolates (10%). Conclusions. The most frequently observed bacterium was E. faecalis, which showed significant resistance to quinolones and to high level aminoglycosides. The CNS strains showed a high level of resistance to methicilline. All these strains were susceptible to glycopeptides.
TI  - Factors influencing broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test results for dalbavancin, a new glycopeptide agent.
AB  - Performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests with new agents requires careful consideration of the properties of the antimicrobial to ensure that the tests are standardized, reproducible, and reflect the true potency of the drug. Dalbavancin is a new glycopeptide with potent activity against gram-positive bacterial species. The investigations described here demonstrated that methodologic modifications of procedures are necessary to ensure consistent test results, both for quality control and for routine testing of clinical isolates. Dimethyl sulfoxide is the preferred primary solvent. The addition of 0.002% polysorbate-80 (a surfactant) to dalbavancin-containing wells in the reference broth microdilution assay resulted in consistent and reproducible MIC results for three quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619. The same degree of consistency was observed among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacterial species tested in several clinical laboratories. These results indicate that the addition of 0.002% (final concentration) of the surfactant in broth microdilution tests produces optimal dalbavancin MICs required for accurate and reproducible clinical laboratory tests, without untoward influences of substrate binding or media constituents.
TI  - Enterococci and streptococci.
AB  - Besides Staphylococcus aureus, other Gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. Some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in Streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. In both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. In the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of silver-containing antimicrobial dressings and drugs.
AB  - Wound dressings containing silver as antimicrobial agents are available in various forms and formulations; however, little is understood concerning their comparative efficacy as antimicrobial agents. Eight commercially available silver-containing dressings, Acticoat 7, Acticoat Moisture Control, Acticoat Absorbent, Silvercel, Aquacel Ag, Contreet F, Urgotol SSD and Actisorb, were tested to determine their comparative antimicrobial effectiveness in vitro and compared against three commercially available topical antimicrobial creams, a non treatment control, and a topical silver-containing antimicrobial gel, Silvasorb. Zone of inhibition and quantitative testing was performed by standard methods using Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Results showed all silver dressings and topical antimicrobials displayed antimicrobial activity. Silver-containing dressings with the highest concentrations of silver exhibited the strongest bacterial inhibitive properties. Concreet F and the Acticoat dressings tended to have greater antimicrobial activity than did the others. Topical antimicrobial creams, including silver sulfadiazine, Sulfamylon and gentamicin sulfate, and the topical antimicrobial gel Silvasorb exhibited superior bacterial inhibition and bactericidal properties, essentially eliminating all bacterial growth at 24 hours. Silver-containing dressings are likely to provide a barrier to and treatment for infection; however, their bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties are inferior to commonly used topical antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Characterization and mechanistic studies of type II isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The recently identified type II isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP):dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) isomerase (IDI-2) is a flavoenzyme that requires FMN and NAD(P)H for activity. IDI-2 is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in several pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis, and thus is considered as a potential new drug target to battle bacterial infections. One notable feature of the IDI-2 reaction is that there is no net change in redox state between the substrate (IPP) and product (DMAPP), indicating that the FMN cofactor must start and finish each catalytic cycle in the same redox state. Here, we report the characterization and initial mechanistic studies of the S. aureus IDI-2. The steady-state kinetic analyses under aerobic and anaerobic conditions show that FMN must be reduced to be catalytically active and the overall IDI-2 reaction is O2-sensitive. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that NADPH is needed only in catalytic amounts to activate the enzyme for multiple turnovers of IPP to DMAPP. The hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to reduce FMN is determined to be pro-S stereospecific. Photoreduction and oxidation-reduction potential studies reveal that the S. aureus IDI-2 can stabilize significant amounts of the neutral FMN semiquinone. In addition, reconstitution of apo-IDI-2 with 5-deazaFMN resulted in a dead enzyme, whereas reconstitution with 1-deazaFMN led to the full recovery of enzyme activity. Taken together, these studies appear to support a catalytic mechanism in which the reduced flavin coenzyme mediates a single electron transfer to and from the IPP substrate during catalysis.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. The systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. To overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. Many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. Among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of oleanolic acid from Salvia officinalis and related compounds on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
AB  - An extract from Salvia officinalis (Sage) leaves showed antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound and identified it as oleanolic acid, a triterpenoid. We also tested antimicrobial activity of similar triterpenoids, ursolic acid, uvaol, betulinic acid and betulin. We found that ursolic acid also showed antimicrobial activity against VRE. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. These two compounds also showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These compounds showed bactericidal activity against VRE at least for 48 h when added at concentrations that were two-times higher than their MICs.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive bacterial isolates from the Asia-Pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a SENTRY Program Report (2003-2004).
AB  - Medical centres in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. Daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined for 120 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (WT) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA)). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. Vancomycin resistance was higher among Enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than Enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. Daptomycin (MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.5-1mg/L) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. All tested isolates of E. faecalis (MIC(90)=2mg/L) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(90)=0.5mg/L) were susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin MIC and MBC values were slightly higher for the hVISA isolates compared with WT-MRSA, with MBC/MIC ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. The MBC/MIC ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hVISA. In contrast, teicoplanin MBC/MIC ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). Daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against Gram-positive isolates collected from Asia-Pacific countries, including hVISA strains.
TI  - Drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci  by the Phoenix automated microbiology system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. Automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) have become recently available. We evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent Phoenix system (BD, Sparks, MD). Diagnostic tools included the new SMIC/ID-2 panel for streptococci, and the PMIC/ID-14 for enterococci. Two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 65), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 50), viridans group streptococci (n = 32), Enterococcus faecium (n = 40), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 43), other catalase-negative cocci (n = 20). When needed, species ID was determined using molecular methods. Test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants (penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides). AST results of the Phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values measured by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). RESULTS: Streptococci: essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) were 91.9% and 98.8%, respectively. Major (ME) and minor errors (mE) accounted for 0.1% and 1.1% of isolates, respectively. No very major errors (VME) were produced. Enterococci: EA was 97%, CA 96%. Small numbers of VME (0.9%), ME (1.4%) and mE (2.8%) were obtained. Overall, EA and CA rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. A few VME were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for E. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for E. faecium. The mean time to results (+/- SD) was 11.8 +/- 0.9 h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci. CONCLUSION: The Phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative AST. Panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate MIC values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  - The in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. All isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared Mueller-Hinton broth and by disk diffusion. Portions of these data were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. In a separate study, MIC and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. The tigecycline MICs at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for Streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for Staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for Neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for Haemophilus spp., 0.25/0.5; for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. Tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. The data from this study confirm the FDA-approved MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for Streptococcus spp. other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Provisional breakpoints for Haemophilus spp. and S. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. The following MIC and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; S. aureus ATCC 25923, 20 to 25 mm; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and 20 to 27 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 9 to 13 mm, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226, 30 to 40 mm.
TI  - In-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It forms a stable inhibitory complex with Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In recent studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, the ceftobiprole MIC(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/L). For MRSA, MIC(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/L). MICs for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant Streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/L. Ceftobiprole is active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90) = 4 mg/L), but not generally active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90) > 16 mg/L). Ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against Gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. However, recent data show activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of ceftazidime. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class A non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class C beta-lactamases. Ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by AmpC beta-lactamase. Studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by MRSA, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. It was also efficacious in murine infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values < or =2 mg/L. The broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of suspected Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, including those caused by MRSA.
TI  - New Tn916-related elements causing erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the as yet unexplored genetic elements encoding erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance in tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci. METHODS: Sixteen Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates sharing erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance and susceptibility to tetracycline were used. Gene detection was performed by PCR using both established and specially designed primers. S. pneumoniae R6, Streptococcus pyogenes 12RF and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 were used as recipients in mating experiments. RESULTS: Of the 16 test strains, 14 bore an unexpressed tet(M) gene which in 13 strains had a genetic linkage with erm(B). Three isolates yielded a 3.2 kb and 10 an 11.9 kb erm(B)/tet(M) amplicon. The former three showed genetic organizations similar to that of the composite element Tn3872, where the erm(B)-carrying Tn917 transposon is inserted into a Tn916-like element. Of the latter 10 isolates, 9 showed genetic organizations substantially overlapping with that of Tn6002, a newly sequenced erm(B)-containing Tn916-related transposon. The tenth isolate carried a novel composite element (designated Tn6003) resulting from the insertion into a Tn6002-like transposon of a fragment [designated macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin (MAS) element] containing a second erm(B) (lacking the stop codon) and a variant of the aadE-sat4-aphA-3 cluster. The two tet(M)-negative isolates had different Tn3872-related elements, one containing a complete and one a deleted MAS fragment. Conjugative transfer was obtained from donors carrying Tn6002-related elements, not from donors carrying Tn3872-related elements. CONCLUSIONS: In tetracycline-susceptible pneumococci with erm(B)-mediated erythromycin resistance, the erm(B) gene is carried on a variety of Tn916-related genetic elements either lacking tet(M) or, more often, carrying an unexpressed tet(M) gene.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - With the incidence of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. These compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. albus, Streptococcus enteridis and S. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (MIC: 3.13-6.25 mug/mL). The position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except S. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely S. albus, S. enteridis.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  - Intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. However, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (DPR), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (ADPR) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the DPR l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines NNC 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and NNC 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity relationship. These compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. Moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. This may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. The results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. Combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - S-adenosylmethionine directly inhibits binding of 30S ribosomal subunits to the SMK box translational riboswitch RNA.
AB  - The S(MK) box is a conserved riboswitch motif found in the 5' untranslated region of metK genes [encoding S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase] in lactic acid bacteria, including Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus sp. Previous studies showed that this RNA element binds SAM in vitro, and SAM binding causes a structural rearrangement that sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence by pairing with an anti-SD (ASD) element. A model was proposed in which SAM binding inhibits metK translation by preventing binding of the ribosome to the SD region of the mRNA. In the current work, the addition of SAM was shown to inhibit binding of 30S ribosomal subunits to S(MK) box RNA; in contrast, the addition of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) had no effect. A mutant RNA, which has a disrupted SD-ASD pairing, was defective in SAM binding and showed no reduction of ribosome binding in the presence of SAM, whereas a compensatory mutation that restored SD-ASD pairing restored the response to SAM. Primer extension inhibition assays provided further evidence for SD-ASD pairing in the presence of SAM. These results strongly support the model that S(MK) box translational repression operates through occlusion of the ribosome binding site and that SAM binding requires the SD-ASD pairing.
TI  - Coniothyrione, a chlorocyclopentandienylbenzopyrone as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor discovered by antisense technology.
AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors interact mainly with rRNA and to some extent ribosomal proteins, which are potential targets for developing new antibacterial agents. Specifically, the ribosomal protein S4 of the 30s ribosomal subunit known as ribosomal protein small-subunit D (rpsD) may be useful as a target. The antisense-rpsD gene-sensitized two-plate assay led to the discovery of a novel chlorinated cyclopentandienylbenzopyrone antibiotic, coniothyrione, C14H9ClO6, isolated from Coniothyrium cerealis MF7209. It exhibited liquid MICs of 16-32 microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis and >64 microg/mL against Escherichia coli. Isolation, structure elucidation, and antibacterial activity of coniothyrione are described.
TI  - Response to alkaline stress by root canal bacteria in biofilms.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether bacteria isolated from infected root canals survive alkaline shifts better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. METHODOLOGY: Clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Olsenella uli, Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, S. oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm and planktonic cultures were stressed at pH 10.5 for 4 h, and cell viability determined using the fluorescent staining LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit. In addition, proteins released into extracellular culture fluids were identified by Western blotting. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis, L. paracasei, O. uli and S. gordonii survived in high numbers in both planktonic cultures and in biofilms after alkaline challenge. S. anginosus, S. oralis and F. nucleatum showed increased viability in biofilms compared with planktonic cultures. Alkaline exposure caused all planktonic cultures to aggregate into clusters and resulted in a greater extrusion of cellular proteins compared with cells in biofilms. Increased levels of DnaK, HPr and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were observed in culture fluids, especially amongst streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: In general, bacteria isolated from infected roots canals resisted alkaline stress better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures, however, planktonic cells appeared to use aggregation and the extracellular transport of specific proteins as survival mechanisms.
TI  - Evaluation of the enteric microflora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana)  and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis).
AB  - The enteric flora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana) and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) has not been well described, despite its potential importance in the understanding of both the normal condition of the intestinal physiology of these animals and the altered colonization within disease states in these birds. Nineteen whooping cranes and 23 sandhill cranes housed currently at the Calgary Zoo or its affiliated Devonian Wildlife Conservation Centre (DWCC) in Calgary, Alberta were sampled from October 2004-February 2005 by collecting aerobic and anaerobic cloacal swabs from each bird. There were seven major groupings of bacteria isolated from both species of crane. Gram-positive cocci, coliforms, and gram-negative bacilli were the most prevalent types of bacteria isolated for both crane species, with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus Group D, not Enterococcus the bacterial species isolated most commonly. There was a significant difference in the average number of isolates per individual between the two crane species but no differences between age or gender categories within crane species. Campylobacter sp. were isolated from five whooping cranes. The potential zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from one whooping crane and C. upsaliensis was isolated from a second. Three other isolates were unspeciated members of the Campylobacter genus and likely belong to a species undescribed previously. The evaluation of the enteric cloacal flora of whooping cranes and sandhill cranes illustrates that differences exist between these two closely related crane species, and highlights the potential implications these differences may have for current practices involving captive wildlife.

TI  - Characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci from Colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci recovered from Colombian hospitals. METHODS: The resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1679), Staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (175), and Enterococcus spp (123). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. RESULTS: Resistance to ERY and CLI was 3.3% and 2.3% for S. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for S. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ERY resistance was 62% in Enterococcus faecalis and 82% in Enterococcus faecium. The MLS(B)-type accounted for 71% of S. pneumoniae and 100% of MRSA. The erm(A) gene was prevalent in MRSA, erm(B) in S. pneumoniae and enterococci, and erm(C) in CoNS isolates. Efflux pump genes (mef(A) genes) were mostly identified in S. pneumoniae (24%). The most common genotype amongst ERY-resistant pneumococci was the Spain(6B)-2 clone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance is low in Colombian pneumococci and high in MRSA (cMLS(B)-type).
TI  - Contribution of a pleural antigen assay (Binax NOW) to the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the detection of pneumococcal antigen in pleural fluid augments conventional microbiological methods used for the etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective study, a rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) [NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae assay; Binax; Scarborough, ME] was performed on pleural fluid samples from 34 patients with pneumonia due to S pneumoniae, 89 patients with effusions of nonpneumococcal origin, and 17 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology. Data on blood cultures, pleural fluid cultures, and urinary antigen tests were recorded. RESULTS: The ICT test result was positive in 24 of 34 patients (70.6%) with pneumococcal pneumonia and negative in 83 of 89 patients (93.3%) without pneumococcal pneumonia. The sensitivity of the pleural ICT test was higher than that obtained for blood (37.5%) and pleural fluid cultures (32.3%), but lower than the detection of pneumococcal antigen in urine samples (82.1%). However, three patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and a negative ICT urine test result had a positive pleural fluid antigen detection result test. Previous antibiotic exposure did not influence pneumococcal antigen detection in either pleural fluid or urine specimens. Six additional patients with empyema due to anaerobes (three patients), Streptococcus viridans (two patients), and Enterococcus faecalis (one patient) had false-positive pleural ICT test results. Finally, the ICT assay finding was also positive in 5 of 17 patients (29.4%) with pneumonia without a definite microbiological cause. CONCLUSIONS: The ICT test performed on pleural fluid samples augments the standard diagnostic methods of blood and pleural fluid cultures, even in the case of prior antibiotic therapy, and enhances the ICT urinary antigen assay.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis in Denmark 2002-2003. A nation-wide laboratory-based registration].
AB  - Notification of bacterial meningitis (BM) is likely to be incomplete, and a recent Danish study indicated that unbalanced notification may bias expected aetiology of BM. Therefore the Danish Bacterial Meningitis Group initiated a national registration of culture-positive BM. METHODS: Laboratory data on all bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid deemed to be clinically relevant were identified on a national basis during 2002 and 2003. Bacterial findings were compared to cases notified during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 404 BM cases were identified. The distribution of bacterial species differed from the national notification data during the same period especially with respect to Staphylococcus aureus (6.7% vs. 0.6%), Escherichia coli (3.5% vs. 0%) and non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci (10% vs. 1.9%). The overall notification-rate was 66%, and was below 20% for S. aureus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, non-S. pneumoniae streptococci and for 13 cases of "other bacteria". Sensitivity to antibiotics in the BM cases was as expected for Northern Europe. Reduced sensitivity to penicillin was found in 2/202 S. pneumoniae, in 2/10 Listeria monocytogenes, and 21/27 S. aureus were penicillin resistant. E. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 5 of 13 cases and to gentamicin in 1 of 11 cases. DISCUSSION: A suboptimal notification rate with an unbalanced species distribution was found. Laboratory based data thus constitute an improved basis for future recommendations for empirical treatment of BM. A continued national collaboration may promote the development of quality indicators for diagnosis and initial treatment of BM.
TI  - Synthesis of rigidly-linked vancomycin dimers and their in vivo efficacy against  resistant bacteria.
AB  - A novel and efficient avenue for the preparation of dimeric vancomycins is described, and the dimers exhibited excellent antibacterial activities in the murine infection model.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 19615 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci collected in North American hospitals (2002-2005).
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against 19,615 clinical strains consecutively collected by numerous centers located across the United States and Canada (2002-2005). Daptomycin was very active against all indicated species (>99% susceptible), with the highest MIC results being 2, 8, 0.5, and 1 microg/mL for staphylococci, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci, respectively, and no significant loss in potency was observed over the period studied.
TI  - Catheter associated infections in hemodialysis patients.
AB  - Hemodialysis catheter related infections (HCRI) are one of the major causes of increasing mortality, morbidity and cost of therapy in hemodialysis patients. Prevention of HCRI requires the identification of predisposing risk factors. To determine the frequency of HCRI risk factors, we studied 116 patients (54% male, mean age of 49.5+/-16 years) patients with HCRI between 2003-2004. Forty one percent of the patients were diabetic. There was a history of previous catheter placement and infection in 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. Pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures included Staphylococcus-aureus 42%, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci 20%, E. Coli 19%, Enterococci 7%, Streptococcus D 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4%, and Klebsiella 1%. Bacterial resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was present in 7% and 4% of the cases, respectively. Hemodialysis catheter related blood borne infections comprised 67% of the total blood-borne infections in our hospital. No significant statistical association was found between HCRI and age, gender, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin level <30 g/L, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anatomical location of catheter, mean duration of antibiotic therapy, mean catheter duration, frequency of hemodialysis sessions, pathogenic organisms, and history of previous catheter infection. We conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic organisms of HCRI were similar to previous studies. However, bacterial resistance to antibiotics was low. The mean duration of catheter usage was longer than previously reported.
TI  - Evaluation of piper cubeba extract, (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  - The activities of the crude ethanol extract from Piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. The crude ethanol extract was more active against Streptococcus salivarius (MIC value of 80 microg/mL). (-)-Cubebin displayed MIC values ranging from 0.20 mm for Streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for Enterococcus faecalis. The natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against Candida albicans at 0.28 mm. The O-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against C. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. Also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-O-(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. Moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. Therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at C-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.
TI  - Sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  - AIM: To explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (UV) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. METHODOLOGY: The sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to UV light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm UV, at a fluence of 1-20 mJ cm(-2). An experimental model was designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of UV light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. RESULTS: Direct exposure to relatively low doses of UV light (2-7 mJ cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. Furthermore, an Enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to UV light (P < 0.001). UV was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. When 4 bacterial cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the UV light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. CONCLUSIONS: The application of UV light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. Nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the UV light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  - [Distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in Malatya University Hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  - The aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in Malatya, which is located in Estern Anatolia part of Turkey. A total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of April-June 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by Phoenix 100 (Becton-Dickinson) system. As a result, 702 (89%) Gram negative and 90 (11%) Gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (14%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.7%). The species distribution was found as follows; K. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), P. aeruginosa (48/51), E.faecalis (27/40), E. cloacae (19/29), P.mirabilis (19/22), C.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and S. aureus (11/30). The first three array were shared by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. Our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.
TI  - A review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in Turkey. METHODS: A search of both the English- and Turkish-language literature indexed on MEDLINE, Ulakbim (Turkey), and Pleksus (Turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their Turkish-language counterparts. The complete texts of the articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of Gulhane Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. Articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. Articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in Turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. RESULTS: Staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in Turkish hospitals. Studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were Staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. In Turkey, S aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing threat in the community. While the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. In the studies reviewed, older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the S aureus isolates. Alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. In recent Turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), and daptomycin have had positive results. As in the S aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the CoNS group of pathogens. The possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. Quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, TMP/SMX, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. Although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate S aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. Current studies in Turkey have found that Enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of Enterococcus faecium. Initial studies performed with linezolid, QD, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. Approximately 8% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in Turkey. However, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (CNS). Resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in Turkey range between 2% and 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: In Turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to CNS infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. However, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. If a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. However, new molecules such as linezolid, QD, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.
TI  - Exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. The interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated. In addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. Moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Tigecycline is a glycylcycline with promising broad-spectrum activity, including  resistant Gram-positive organisms. This study characterizes in vitro activity of tigecycline against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (QRSP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). An in vitro pharmacodynamic model generated specific bacterial kill profiles for tigecycline against clinical isolates of QRSP, MRSA and VRE. Tigecycline produced a 6.6 log total reduction and cleared QRSP from the pharmacodynamic model by 18 h. Tigecycline and vancomycin were unable to achieve 3-log reductions in the MRSA and VRE isolates; log reductions in MRSA and VRE were 1.5 and 1.2 logs for tigecycline and 2.8 and zero for vancomycin, respectively. Area under the concentration time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) values for tigecycline ranged from 79 to 158 microg h/mL and tigecycline concentrations remained above the MIC (T>MIC) throughout the simulated dosing interval. Tigecycline showed in vitro activity against the QRSP, MRSA and VRE isolates studied. Low MIC values, prolonged elimination half-life and the associated post-antibiotic effect (PAE) observed with tigecycline are desirable attributes that make it a potentially attractive option for treating resistant Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Dual targeting of GyrB and ParE by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  - A structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential ATPase activities of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and that show potent activities against a variety of bacterial pathogens. Two such compounds, VRT-125853 and VRT-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. In metabolite incorporation assays, VRT-125853 inhibited both DNA and RNA synthesis but had little effect on protein synthesis. Both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid DNA in Escherichia coli at the MIC. Sequencing of DNA corresponding to the GyrB and ParE ATP-binding regions in VRT-125853- and VRT-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was GyrB, whereas in Streptococcus pneumoniae it was ParE. In Enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of VRT-125853 was ParE, whereas for VRT-752586 it was GyrB. DNA transformation experiments with H. influenzae and S. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrB resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. Novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in S. aureus, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae were found in gyrB, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to VRT-125853 or VRT-752586 and vice versa. Furthermore, gyrB and parE double mutations increased the MICs of VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. Spontaneous frequencies of resistance to VRT-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type E. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility in vitro.
TI  - Monotherapy versus combination therapy.
AB  - The science of antibiotic therapy for infectious diseases continues to evolve. In many instances where empiric coverage is necessary, treatment with more than one agent is considered prudent. If an etiology is identified, antibiotics are modified based on culture and susceptibility data. Even when the organism is known, more than one antibiotic may be needed. Decisions about antibiotics should be made after assessments of pertinent clinical information, laboratory and microbiology information, ease of administration, patient compliance, potential adverse effects, cost, and available evidence supporting various treatment options. Clinicians also need to consider synergy and local resistance patterns in selecting therapeutic options. In this article, the authors outline monotherapy and combination therapy options for several common infectious diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. Clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. The clinical significance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae is discussed. The clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to Enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and E faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. Differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections are reviewed. Differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are described. Finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of HA-MRSA and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections are compared.
TI  - Topical ethyl chloride fine spray. Does it have any antimicrobial activity?
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (Cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. The plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. RESULTS: The model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. The estimate of the percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. There was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). CONCLUSION: The use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. The authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. This coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.

AB  - A 57-year-old man presented with triple valve infective endocarditis. There were  vegetations on the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valve. He had multiple complications such as pulmonary abscess, severe anaemia, and congestive heart failure. His general condition was extremely poor. Intensive medical therapy, such as blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and inotropic support, allowed him to tolerate surgery. Triple valve replacement was successfully performed without major complication. Vegetation cultures grew Streptococcus bovis and Enterecoccus faecalis. At 1 year follow-up, the patient is alive in NYHA functional class I.
TI  - Isolation and identification of the icosalides--cyclic peptolides with selective  antibiotic and cytotoxic activities.
AB  - Three cyclic peptolides have been isolated from two different fungal species and  their structures determined. Icosalides A1 (1a), A2 (1b), and B (1c) each contain two serine and two leucine amino acid residues and incorporate two fatty acid moieties as part of the central twenty-member ring. 1a contains L-serine and both D- and L-leucine residues, while 1b and 1c contain only L-amino acid residues. Icosalide A1 displays antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae (Felton), and Enterococcus faecalis. Icosalides A2 and B are cytotoxic to replicating MDCK cells.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of ceftobiprole against 12 Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SMEs), and sub-MIC effects of ceftobiprole were determined for 12 gram-positive organisms. Pneumococcal, staphylococcal, and enterococcal PAEs were 1.4 to 3.1 h, 0 to 1.8 h, and 0 to 0.9 h, respectively. The PA-SMEs (0.4 times the MIC) for pneumococci, staphylococci, and enterococci were 4.8 to >10.3 h, 1.5 to 9.6 h, and 3.8 to >10.7 h, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of two mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) preparations against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of gray-colored MTA (GMTA) and white-colored MTA (WMTA) against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis were assessed in vitro using the tube dilution test. Broth tubes were prepared and divided into experimental and control groups. Aliquots of each of the tested microorganisms were taken from a stock culture and added to each experimental and positive control group. All groups were incubated at 37 degrees C and evaluated for turbidity at 0, 1, 24, 48, and 72-hour time periods. A direct correlation was found between GMTA and WMTA concentrations and their antibacterial effect. Tubes containing GMTA in concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/ml did not show E. faecalis growth at any of the time periods tested whereas tubes containing WMTA showed E. faecalis growth at all concentrations and time periods tested. Statistically significant differences were found between tubes containing GMTA in concentrations of 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml and tubes containing similar concentrations of WMTA (p < 0.001). Tubes containing GMTA in concentrations of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.12 mg/ml and tubes containing WMTA in concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/ml did not show S. sanguis growth at any of the time periods tested. Statistically significant differences were found between tubes containing GMTA in concentrations 6.25 and 3.12 mg/ml and tubes containing similar concentrations of WMTA (p < 0.001). It appears that the susceptibility of E. faecalis and S. sanguis to MTA differed and that GMTA requires lower concentrations than WMTA to exert the same antibacterial effect against each of the microorganisms tested.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Functional characterization and Me ion specificity of a Ca-citrate transporter from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Secondary transporters of the bacterial CitMHS family transport citrate in complex with a metal ion. Different members of the family are specific for the metal ion in the complex and have been shown to transport Mg(2+)-citrate, Ca(2+)-citrate or Fe(3+)-citrate. The Fe(3+)-citrate transporter of Streptococcus mutans clusters on the phylogenetic tree on a separate branch with a group of transporters found in the phylum Firmicutes which are believed to be involved in anaerobic citrate degradation. We have cloned and characterized the transporter from Enterococcus faecalis EfCitH in this cluster. The gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and studied using right-side-out membrane vesicles. The transporter catalyzes proton-motive-force-driven uptake of the Ca(2+)-citrate complex with an affinity constant of 3.5 microm. Homologous exchange is catalyzed with a higher efficiency than efflux down a concentration gradient. Analysis of the metal ion specificity of EfCitH activity in right-side-out membrane vesicles revealed a specificity that was highly similar to that of the Bacillus subtilis Ca(2+)-citrate transporter in the same family. In spite of the high sequence identity with the S. mutans Fe(3+)-citrate transporter, no transport activity with Fe(3+) (or Fe(2+)) could be detected. The transporter of E. faecalis catalyzes translocation of citrate in complex with Ca(2+), Sr(2+), Mn(2+), Cd(2+) and Pb(2+) and not with Mg(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Co(2+). The specificity appears to correlate with the size of the metal ion in the complex.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities of Carlina acanthifolia root essential oil.
AB  - The root of Carlina acanthifolia All. (Asteraceae) has been traditionally used in the treatment of various disorders including stomach and skin diseases. We studied antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities of Carlina acanthifolia root essential oil, in order to validate some of the ethnopharmacological claims. Antimicrobial activity was tested on 15 bacteria and three strains of fungi using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution methods. In assessing anti-inflammatory activity the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema test was used, while ethanol-induced stress gastric ulcer test in rats was used in testing anti-ulcer activity. Antioxidant properties were evaluated trough the effect of the essential oil on lipid peroxidation (TBA assay) and its capability of quenching 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and OH radicals. The oil expressed significant antimicrobial activity, being the most active against Gram (+) bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and against Candida albicans. In all applied concentrations, Carlina acanthifolia root essential oil reduced carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema in dose-dependent manner, achieving high degree of anti-inflammatory activity. The effect was comparable with that of indomethacin used as a reference drug. In the ethanol-induced stress gastric ulcer test in rats, it was shown that the tested essential oil produced significant dose-dependent gastroprotective activity. The results also pointed out substantial and dose-dependent antioxidant activity of the investigated essential oil, with carlina oxide as the main antioxidant component.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Topoisomerase mutations and efflux are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - To understand better the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants isolated from Ent. faecalis ATCC 29212 by stepwise selection with sparfloxacin (SPX) and norfloxacin (NOR) were analysed. The results showed the following. (i) In general, fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms in Ent. faecalis are similar to those in other Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, namely, mutants with amino acid changes in both GyrA and ParC exhibited high fluoroquinolone resistance, and single GyrA mutants and a single ParC mutant were more resistant to SPX and NOR, respectively, than the parent strain, indicating that the primary targets of SPX and NOR in Ent. faecalis are DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, respectively. (ii) Alterations in GyrB (DeltaKGA, residues 395-397) and ParE (Glu-459 to Lys) were associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in some mutants. Moreover, the facts that the NOR MIC, but not the SPX MIC, decreased in the presence of multidrug efflux pump inhibitors, that NOR accumulation decreased in the cells, and that the EmeA mRNA expression level did not change, strongly suggested that a NorA-like efflux pump, rather than EmeA, was involved in resistance to NOR.
TI  - Pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones, inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  - A series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one inhibitors  of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) has been prepared. The 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones show low micromolar IC(50) values versus E. coli MurB and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus GC 1131, Enterococcus faecalis GC 2242, Streptococcus pneumoniae GC 1894, and E. coli GC 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. None of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. Moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by Streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. A partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving MurB potency and MIC values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the C-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one core. Docking studies using FLO and PharmDock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the MurB active site.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the southeastern Mediterranean--preliminary results from the ARMed project.
AB  - Sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the Mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been lacking in the past. Susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey were collected as part of the ARMed project. Preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae to range from 0% (Malta) to 36% (Algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan [median: 43%]. Significant country specific resistance in E. coli was also seen, with 72% of isolates from Egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in Turkey. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of E. faecalis isolates from Turkey and in 3.8% of E. faecium isolates from Cyprus. The preliminary results from the ARMed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the Mediterranean region. They suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern Mediterranean region where resistance in S. aureus and E. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the other countries of the Mediterranean.
TI  - C-terminal WxL domain mediates cell wall binding in Enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Analysis of the genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate V583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. Twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved C-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated WxL. Proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the WxL region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. This hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the C-terminal regions of two WxL proteins in E. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the reporter fusions in E. faecalis. This localization was eliminated by introducing specific deletions into the domains. Interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. We also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for WxL domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. Based on our findings, we propose that the WxL region is a novel cell wall binding domain in E. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Two-component signal transduction systems as key players in stress responses of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) continue as an important group of gram-positive bacteria that have been extensively exploited in food industries and various biotechnological applications. Some LAB species are, however, opportunistic pathogens and were reported to be associated with overwhelming number of human infections. During the use of LAB in industry or over the course of human infection, these bacteria are exposed to environmental stress. While LAB display adaptive mechanisms to cope with adverse conditions, the regulation of these mechanisms remains to be elucidated. Recent completion of genome sequencing of various LAB strains combined with the development of advanced molecular techniques have enabled the identification of a number of putative two-component signal transduction systems, also known as two-component regulatory systems (2CRS), in LAB. Examining the effect of deleting genes specifying putative 2CRS proteins in these organisms has revealed the involvement of 2CRS in the responses of LAB to different stresses. There are lines of evidence indicating that certain 2CRS may mediate a general stress response in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. This review highlights the influence of 2CRS on the physiology of LAB during optimal growth and survival/growth on exposure to environmental stress.
TI  - Conventional identification of Streptococcus uberis isolated from bovine mastitis in Argentinean dairy herds.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate a conventional scheme for identifying Streptococcus uberis strains isolated from bovine mastitis. Seventy-five gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were collected from cows with mastitis from 19 dairy herds located in the east-central region of Argentina. Five American Type Culture Collection strains and bovine isolates were identified by the API 20 Strep system and by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA. A conventional scheme based on 11 biochemical tests was selected for identification of Strep. uberis strains: the Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen reaction; hydrolysis of Arg, esculin, and sodium hippurate; growth in inulin, mannitol, raffinose, salicin, and sorbitol; and growth at 45 degrees C and in 6.5% NaCl. Reference strains and 25 bovine isolates were classified accurately to the species level by the conventional scheme in a blind assay. Each reference strain and each bovine isolate were identified as belonging to the same species following these 3 methods. The remaining 50 isolates identified as Strep. uberis by the API 20 Strep system and 16S rDNA RFLP were assayed by the conventional scheme. This scheme correctly identified 47 (94%) of 50 isolates as Strep. uberis by comparing their biochemical profile with that of the reference strain. Three (6%) of the 50 isolates were classified as Strep. uberis by the API 20 Strep system and by 16S rDNA RFLP and were identified as Enterococcus faecalis by the conventional scheme. Thirty percent of the Strep. uberis strains showed biochemical profiles identical to the Strep. uberis American Type Culture Collection 27958 strain. Seventy percent of the Strep. uberis strains demonstrated variability compared with the reference strain, resulting in 19 different biochemical profiles. The conventional scheme proposed in this study resulted in a relatively low number of misidentifications and could biochemically identify not only typical, but also atypical Strep. uberis strains. This conventional scheme can be considered an adequate method for identifying Strep. uberis strains isolated from bovine mastitis because of its affordable cost in developing countries, and it may contribute to determining the frequency of isolation of Strep. uberis strains in Argentinean dairy herds.
TI  - Use of the Phoenix automated system for identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - The Phoenix system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) was evaluated for identification (ID) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. Two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), Enterococcus faecium (n = 36), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). The API system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used as a comparator. Molecular methods (sequencing of 16S rRNA and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. Upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species ID was achieved by the Phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70 (90.0%) enterococci. Excellent results were obtained for S. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). With regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the Phoenix system was 83.9%. Among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the Streptococcus sanguinis group and Streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the Streptococcus mitis group. Four E. faecium and three E. faecalis isolates were misidentified as Enterococcus casseliflavus/Enterococcus gallinarum or Enterococcus durans. Thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. Compared with commercially available systems, the Phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. The SMIC/ID-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.
TI  - Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  - In most organisms, glutathione (GSH) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and GSH synthetase (GS). In Streptococcus agalactiae, GSH synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-GCS-GS). The N-terminal sequence of gamma-GCS-GS is similar to Escherichia coli gamma-GCS, but the C-terminal sequence is an ATP-grasp domain more similar to d-Ala, d-Ala ligase than to any known GS. In the present studies, C-terminally and N-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-GCS and GS domains, respectively. Although WT gamma-GCS-GS is nearly uninhibited by GSH (K(i) approximately 140 mM), shorter gamma-GCS domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (K(i) approximately 15 mM), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-GCS enzymes. Because studies with E. coli gamma-GCS implicate a flexible loop region in GSH binding, chimeras of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS were made containing gamma-GCS domain flexible loop sequences from Enterococcus faecalis and Pasteurella multocida gamma-GCS-GS, isoforms that are inhibited by GSH. Inhibition remained S. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). C-Terminal constructs of gamma-GCS-GS have GS activity (0.01-0.04% of WT), but proper folding and significant GS activity required a covalently linked gamma-GCS domain. In addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-GCS-GS sequence established that GS activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-GCS domain. Our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-GCS-GS and suggest gamma-GCS-GS evolved from a monomeric gamma-GCS that became C-terminally fused to a multimeric ATP-grasp protein.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Purification and functional studies of a potent modified quorum-sensing peptide and a two-peptide bacteriocin in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Bacteria use quorum-sensing signals or autoinducers to communicate. The signals in Gram-positive bacteria are often peptides activated by proteolytic removal of an N-terminal leader sequence. While investigating stimulation of antimicrobial peptide production by the Streptococcus mutans synthetic competence stimulating peptide signal (21-CSP), we found a peptide similar to the 21-CSP, but lacking the three C-terminal amino acid residues (18-CSP). The 18-CSP was more potent in inducing competence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial activity than the 21-CSP. Our results indicate that cleavage of the three C-terminal residues occurred post export, and was not regulated by the CSP-signalling system. Deletion of comD encoding the CSP receptor abolished the competence and biofilm responses to the 21-CSP and the 18-CSP, suggesting that signal transduction via the ComD receptor is involved in the responses to both CSPs. In S. mutans GS5, beside the 18-CSP we also purified to homogeneity a two-peptide bacteriocin which production was stimulated by the 18-CSP and the 21-CSP. Partial sequence of the two-peptide bacteriocin revealed the product of the smbAB genes recently described. We found that the peptide SmbB was slightly different from the deduced sequence, and confirmed the prediction that both peptides constituting SmbAB bacteriocin are post-translationally modified. SmbAB exhibited antimicrobial activity against 11 species of streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylocococcus epidermidis. Taken together, the findings support the involvement of the CSP response in bacteriocin production by streptococci and suggest a novel strategy to potentiate autoinducer activity.
TI  - Resistance to acidic and alkaline environments in the endodontic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms employed by the endodontic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis to confer acid- and alkali-resistance and to compare these with the mechanisms of representative oral streptococci. METHODS: E. faecalis JCM8728, Streptococcus mutans NCTC10449 and Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10556 were used to assess both acid- and alkali-resistance by examining: (i) growth in complex media; (ii) stability of intracellular pH (pH(in)); (iii) cell durability to leakage of preloaded BCECF (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein); and (iv) cell permeability to SYTOX-Green. RESULTS: Growth was initiated by E. faecalis at pH 4.0-11.0, by S. mutans at pH 4.0-9.0 and by S. sanguinis at pH 5.0-9.0. The pH(in) was similar to the extracellular pH in S. mutans and S. sanguinis at pH 5-10, while the pH(in) of E. faecalis was maintained at approximately 7.5-8.5 when extracellular pH was 7.5-10 and was maintained at levels equivalent to the extracellular pH when pH < 7.5. Cell membranes of E. faecalis were resistant to BCECF leakage when extracellular pH was 2.5-12 and to SYTOX-Green permeability at pH 4-10. The cell membrane durability to extracellular pH in E. faecalis was higher than that observed in the Streptococcus strains. CONCLUSION: Compared to S. mutans, E. faecalis was found to be equally resistant to acid and more resistant to alkalis. The results suggest that pH-resistance in E. faecalis is attributed to membrane durability against acid and alkali, in addition to cell membrane-bound proton-transport systems. These characteristics may account for why E. faecalis is frequently isolated from acidic caries lesions and from persistently infected root canals where calcium hydroxide medication is ineffective.
TI  - Influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. In eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated. After 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. Of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. When bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. Combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. When no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the quality of the root filling. In contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. In root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. The present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.
TI  - Modified GC medium for identification of group B streptococci.
AB  - The modified GC medium (MGC) was developed for identification of beta-hemolytic group B streptococci. This medium was developed on the basis of enhancing-pigment production of group B streptococci. Three hundred and thirty isolates were tested including 180 isolates of beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, 102 isolates of beta-hemolytic non-group B streptococci, and 48 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis. All isolates of group B streptococci gave carotenoid pigment by this medium. On the other hand, all of non-group B streptococci and E. faecalis did not show pigment after 72 h incubation. The specificity and sensitivity of MGC was 100%. There were no false positive and false negative in this medium. The MGC may be the alternative of choice for the presumptive identification of group B streptococci.
TI  - Incidence and behaviour of Tn916-like elements within tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from root canals.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tetracycline resistance is commonly found in endodontic bacteria. One of the most common tetracycline-resistance genes is tet(M), which is often encoded on the broad-host-range conjugative transposon Tn916. This study aimed to determine whether tet(M) was present in bacteria isolated from endodontic patients at the Eastman Dental Institute and whether this gene was carried on the transferable conjugative transposon Tn916. METHODS: The cultivable microflora isolated from 15 endodontic patients was screened for resistance to tetracycline. Polymerase chain reactions for tet(M) and for unique regions of Tn916 were carried out on the DNA of all tetracycline-resistant bacteria. Filter-mating experiments were used to see if transfer of any Tn916-like elements could occur. RESULTS: Eight out of 15 tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated were shown to possess tet(M). Furthermore, four of these eight were shown to possess the Tn916-unique regions linked to the tet(M) gene. Transfer experiments demonstrated that a Neisseria sp. donor could transfer an extremely unstable Tn916-like element to Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The tet(M) gene is present in the majority of tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated in this study and the conjugative transposon Tn916 has been shown to be responsible for the support and transfer of this gene in some of the bacteria isolated.
TI  - Coenzyme Q10 production in recombinant Escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  - In the present work, Escherichia coli DH5alpha was metabolically engineered for CoQ(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsA) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Grown in 2YTG medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial pH of 7, the recombinant E. coli was capable of CoQ(10) production up to 470 microg/gDCW (dry cell weight). This value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gDCW simply by increasing the initial culture pH from 7 to 9. Supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. However, engineering of a lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the CoQ(10) production. Lower mevalonate semi-pathways of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. Among these, the pathway of Streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding CoQ(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gDCW when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mM. In order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. In a recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as DdsA enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-CoA to IPP, resulting in CoQ(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gDCW, without mevalonate supplementation. In contrast, a whole mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. However, it provided CoQ(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gDCW, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsA alone.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Bactericidal effect of Nd:YAG laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  - AIM: To define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. METHODOLOGY: The hypothesis was tested ex vivo that Nd:YAG laser irradiation has a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. Resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (CSEM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct Nd:YAG laser irradiation, respectively. RESULTS: The Nd:YAG laser irradiation (1.5 W, 15 Hz, four times for 5 s) of Enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a 99.7% kill, but no sterilization. The CSEM procedure verified that the extent of radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. After 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of Actinomyces naeslundii or Streptococcus anginosus were discernible. However, when micro-colonies of S. anginosus and specially biofilms of E. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using ESEM and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: The Nd:YAG laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. Endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect in vitro of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide impregnated  gutta-percha points.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of points containing antiseptics used for temporary obturation in endodontics. Points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko and Hygienic), and chlorhexidine (Roeko) were tested and gutta-percha points served as control (Meta Dental Corp.). The following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Staphylococcus aureus (Sta), Candida albicans (Ca), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) ATCC 25586, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) ATCC 33277, and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) ATCC 25611. The experiments were organized in three stages: 1st stage: one point of each kind was placed on agar plates previously seeded with microorganisms. 2nd stage: Another group of points was immersed in broth for 24 hours and placed on the seeded agar. Samples were then incubated at 37 degrees in the conditions of oxygen and for the time required by each microorganism. The zones of bacterial inhibition around each point were measured. The pH values of the broths were recorded. 3rd stage: the immersion broths were inoculated with suspensions of microorganisms, incubated, seeded on plates by dissemination and incubated. CFU counts were performed. RESULTS: points containing chlorhexidine showed inhibition zones with every microorganism in the 1st stage and, in the 2nd stage, with most of the microorganisms studied, except for Fn and Pi. Calcium hydroxide containing points did not inhibit any of the microorganisms assessed. Broth pH values did not exhibit any changes. CFU counts of the broths in which chlorhexidine points had been immersed showed total inhibition for all the microorganisms. The differences between materials were statistically significant (p<0.05) (ANOVA). In the conditions of this study, chlorhexidine-containing points proved to be effective against most of the tested strains.
TI  - Antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (Superbonder, Loctite, Brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. METHODS: We analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) S. aureus (ATCC 25923); (3) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; (4) Streptococcus pyogenes; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853); (8) Escherichia coli (ATCC25922); and (9) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C and its growth examined after 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of nocathiacin I analogues.
AB  - Stereoselective reduction of dehydroalanine double bond in nocathiacin I afforded the primary amide 2. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the amide 2 provided the carboxylic acid 3, which upon coupling with a variety of amines furnished amides 4-32. Some of these semi-synthetic derivatives have retained very good antibacterial activity and have improved aqueous solubility.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  - The study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the Outpatient Service of the Transplantation Institute in Warsaw. The patients enrolled into the study had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. In the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures. Cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). Eventually, urinary tract infection (UTI) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic UTI and 22 cases of asymptomatic UTI) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. In cases where urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: Escherichia coli: 22 strains, Enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, Enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of Ralstonia picketii, Streptococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Over 90% of Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. The only drug of similar efficacy, which could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.
TI  - In vitro characterization of the antibacterial spectrum of novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors of the aminobenzimidazole class.
AB  - Antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are becoming increasingly important in the battle against bacterial resistance to all currently used classes of antibiotics. Bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (topoIV) are the familiar targets of fluoroquinolone and coumarin antibiotics. Here we present the characterization of two members of a new class of synthetic bacterial topoII ATPase inhibitors: VRT-125853 and VRT-752586. These aminobenzimidazole compounds were potent inhibitors of both DNA gyrase and topoIV and had excellent antibacterial activities against a wide spectrum of problematic pathogens responsible for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and mycobacteria. Consistent with the novelty of their structures and mechanisms of action, antibacterial potency was unaffected by commonly encountered resistance phenotypes, including fluoroquinolone resistance. In time-kill assays, VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 were bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, causing 3-log reductions in viable cells within 24 h. Finally, similar to the fluoroquinolones, relatively low frequencies of spontaneous resistance to VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 were found, a property consistent with their in vitro dual-targeting activities.
TI  - Characterization of Ers, a PrfA-like regulator of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - We have identified a transcriptional regulator, named Ers (for enterococcal regulator of survival), of Enterococcus faecalis, an important opportunistic bacterium commonly recovered from hospitalized patients. Ers is a member of the Crp/Fnr family and is 69% similar to Srv, a PrfA-like regulator of Streptococcus pyogenes implicated in virulence, and is the E. faecalis protein most closely related to PrfA, a positive regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes. In an in vivo-in vitro macrophage infection model, the survival of an ers mutant was highly significantly decreased compared with that of the parental strain JH2-2. This mutant was more than 10-fold more sensitive to oxidative challenge by hydrogen peroxide. In order to identify genes whose expression was under Ers control, the RNA levels of 31 likely candidates were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The results indicate that ers may be autoregulated and that the locus ef0082 appears to be positively regulated by Ers. Nevertheless, mutation of ef0082 did not result in any detectable changes in the survival of the bacterium within murine macrophages.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, LBM415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of LBM415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDFI) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTI), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. METHODS: A total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. Characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS); resistance to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) among 18.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of Enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: LBM415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus faecium and Moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/L; 97.0% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of H. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. Seventy-seven percent of Burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/L. No differences in LBM415 activity against S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and H. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. While regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to LBM415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. One isolate of S. aureus displayed high-level resistance to LBM415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defB and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. This isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: With few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first PDFI class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. These compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. Given the detection of a pre-existing PDFI-resistant isolate of S. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the PDFI-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
TI  - Preparation and antimicrobial activity of gelatin microparticles containing propolis against oral pathogens.
AB  - Gelatin microparticles containing propolis ethanolic extractive solution were prepared by spray-drying technique. Particles with regular morphology, mean diameter ranging of 2.27 microm to 2.48 microm, and good entrapment efficiency for propolis were obtained. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of oral importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Candida albicans, and Lactobacillus casei). The utilized techniques were diffusion in agar and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. The choice of the method to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of microparticles showed be very important. The microparticles displayed activity against all tested strains of similar way to the propolis, showing greater activity against the strains of E. salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. mitis, and C. albicans.
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin tested against isolates from pediatric patients: report  from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America, 1998-2003).
AB  - The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program has monitored the activity of antimicrobial agents worldwide since 1997. The increasing number of clinical failures with established anti-infectives (penicillins, other beta-lactams, macrolides) among pediatric patients has stressed the importance for alternative therapeutic options. Ciprofloxacin has been recently approved for expanded use as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children, and gatifloxacin has been used successfully in clinical trials in selected children with severe or refractory otitis media. We evaluated the activity of gatifloxacin against strains isolated from children < 7 years of age and compared this to the general patient population (all ages included) using the SENTRY Program database. A total of 59826 North American isolates were collected, of which 4641 were from children (< 7 years old); all isolates were tested using reference broth microdilution methods. In contrast to the general population (GP), gatifloxacin resistance rates were very low among isolates from this younger patient group. Gatifloxacin susceptibility rates were > 84% for all pathogens evaluated in younger patients. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from children < 7 years old were susceptible to gatifloxacin, and susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae species was > 98%. The greatest difference in susceptibility rates between the younger children and the GP was observed among nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (95.0-100% versus 64.8-83.7%, respectively) and Enterococcus faecalis (94.7% versus 58.4%). Gatifloxacin susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. isolates from the pediatric population were > or = 95% (> 97% for ciprofloxacin) compared to the GP at only 64.8-69.1%. In conclusion, gatifloxacin remains very active against bacterial isolates from children < 7 years, indicative of the limited exposure of this population to fluoroquinolones. Continued resistance surveillance will be necessary to monitor the activity of the fluoroquinolone class as they are introduced for specific clinical indications into the pediatric age groups, especially if re-studied against S. pneumoniae (refractory otitis media) and P. aeruginosa (cystic fibrosis associated pneumonia).
TI  - Promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pA-V-F) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. The vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in D-Ala-D-Ala. The fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. Flow cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled S. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled S. pneumoniae were opsonized. The bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured J774 macrophage-like cells. Flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested S. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than S. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of S. aureus by macrophages). This paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of Gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - The TraA relaxase autoregulates the putative type IV secretion-like system encoded by the broad-host-range Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pIP501.
AB  - The conjugative multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pIP501 can be transferred  and stably maintained in a variety of Gram-positive genera, including multicellular Streptomyces lividans, as well as in Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The 15 putative pIP501 transfer (tra) genes are organized in an operon-like structure terminating in a strong transcriptional terminator. This paper reports co-transcription of the pIP501 tra genes in exponentially growing Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells, as shown by RT-PCR. The tra genes are expressed throughout the life cycle of Ent. faecalis, and the expression level is independent of the growth phase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the TraA relaxase, the first gene of the tra operon, binds to the tra promoter P(tra), which partially overlaps with the origin of transfer (oriT). DNase I footprinting experiments further delimited the TraA binding region and defined the nucleotides bound by TraA. Beta-Galactosidase assays with P(tra)-lacZ fusions proved P(tra) promoter activity, which was strongly repressed when TraA was supplied in trans. Thus, it is concluded that the pIP501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative DNA relaxase TraA.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel C12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  - A novel series of C12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. The C12 modification involves replacing the natural C12 methyl group in the erythromycin core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. From the C12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of C12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. Several compounds were found to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. The C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. These pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of temporary filling materials.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial properties of temporary fillings. The direct contact test (DCT) was used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of Revoltek LC, Tempit, Systemp inlay, and IRM. These were tested in contact with Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis. The materials were examined immediately after setting, 1, 7, 14, and 30 days after aging in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey multiple comparison. Systemp inlay, Tempit, and IRM exhibited antibacterial properties when in contact with S. mutans for at least 7 days, Tempit and IRM sustained this ability for at least 14 days. When in contact with E. faecalis Tempit and IRM were antibacterial immediately after setting, IRM sustained this ability for at least 1 day. Our study suggests that the difference in temporary filling materials may influence which microorganism will be able to invade the root canal system.
TI  - The S(MK) box is a new SAM-binding RNA for translational regulation of SAM synthetase.
AB  - We have identified the S(MK) box as a conserved RNA motif in the 5' untranslated  leader region of metK (SAM synthetase) genes in lactic acid bacteria, including Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Lactococcus species. This RNA element bound SAM in vitro, and binding of SAM caused an RNA structural rearrangement that resulted in sequestration of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Mutations that disrupted pairing between the SD region and a sequence complementary to the SD blocked SAM binding, whereas compensatory mutations that restored pairing restored SAM binding. The Enterococcus faecalis S(MK) box conferred translational repression of a lacZ reporter when cells were grown under conditions where SAM pools are elevated, and mutations that blocked SAM binding resulted in loss of repression, demonstrating that the S(MK) box is functional in vivo. The S(MK) box therefore represents a new SAM-binding riboswitch distinct from the previously identified S box RNAs.
TI  - Linezolid in prophylaxis against experimental aortic valve endocarditis due to Streptococcus oralis or Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - There are no experimental studies regarding the prophylactic efficacy of linezolid against infective endocarditis. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis of the aortic valve was induced in rabbits by the insertion of a polyethylene catheter. Twenty-four hours later, animals were randomly assigned to a control group, and groups receiving either ampicillin (two doses of 40 mg/kg of body weight each, given intravenously, 2 h apart) or linezolid (a single per os dose of 75 mg/kg). The first dose of ampicillin and the single dose of linezolid were administered 0.5 and 1 h, respectively, prior to the intravenous inoculation of approximately 10(7) CFU of Streptococcus oralis or Enterococcus faecalis. Linezolid peak levels in rabbit serum were similar to the peak serum levels in humans following a 600-mg oral dose of linezolid. Linezolid prevented endocarditis in 87% of S. oralis-challenged rabbits (P < 0.001 versus controls; P = 0.026 versus ampicillin). In rabbits challenged with E. faecalis, linezolid prevented endocarditis in 73% (P = 0.003 versus controls; P = 0.049 versus ampicillin). Ampicillin prevented endocarditis due to S. oralis or due to E. faecalis in 47% (P = 0.005 versus controls) and in 30% (P = not significant versus controls) of the challenged animals, respectively. In conclusion, linezolid was effective as prophylaxis against endocarditis caused by a strain of S. oralis and to a lesser degree against that caused by a strain of E. faecalis. Its prophylactic efficacy was superior to that of ampicillin.
TI  - 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, novel inhibitors of UDP-N- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB) with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB). Compounds 1 to 3, which are 1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited Escherichia coli MurB, Staphyloccocus aureus MurB, and E. coli MurA with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microM, 4.3 to 10.3 microM, and 6.8 to 29.4 microM, respectively. Compound 4, a C-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. coli MurB, S. aureus MurB, and E. coli MurC (IC50s, 24.5 to 35 microM). A fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with E. coli MurB, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nM. Structural characterization of E. coli MurB was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of MurB and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with IC50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microM. Antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (MICs, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (MICs, 4 to 8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (BACTEC 9240 and BacT/ALERT 3D) on culture positivity.
AB  - The effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into BacTAlert 3D and BACTEC 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees C vs 35 degrees C) on bacterial growth was evaluated. The delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. Culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. The positivity rate decreased significantly for Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. Culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees C for all microorganisms especially for Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for BACTEC compared with BacTAlert 3D and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees C compared with 22 degrees C. The negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of conserved hypothetical protein HP0894 from Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0894 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25554) is an 88-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 with a calculated pI of 8.5 and a molecular weight of 10.38 kDa. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0894 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157, etc. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0894. About 97.5% (418/429) of the HN, N, CO, Ca, Cbeta resonances of the 88 residues of HP0894 were assigned. On the basis of these assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0894, and studying its interaction with its substrates, if any, and/or with other proteins.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Novel 4-N-substituted aryl pent-2-ene-1,4-dione derivatives of piperazinyloxazolidinones as antibacterials.
AB  - A few substituted piperazinylphenyloxazolidinone compounds 6-13 having substitution on the distant nitrogen atom of piperazine ring scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity in Gram-positive bacteria. A few compounds showed superior in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes than linezolid and eperezolid.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - Activity of a new oral streptogramin, XRP2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of XRP2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of RPR132552 (streptogramin A) and RPR202868 (streptogramin B), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. The effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin A or B on the activity of XRP2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The species tested included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. XRP2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against S. aureus, E. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against E. faecalis (MICs = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). XRP2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Nevertheless, the strong activity of factor A of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and E. faecium (MICs = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low MICs against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor A or factor B of the streptogramin. However, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors A and B caused an increase in the MICs of XRP2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. As with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of XRPR2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.
TI  - Flavonoid analysis and antimicrobial activity of commercially available propolis  products.
AB  - Propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. Since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the Croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. Antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis NCTC 8236, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12204, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and one yeast-like fungus Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were compared. Results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. Total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most products had the flavonoids content below 9%. All products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four Gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against P. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus C. albicans. Total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. Our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.
TI  - Modulation of antibody-mediated immune response by probiotics in chickens.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, have been shown to enhance antibody responses in mammals. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to Streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken antibody response to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut. The birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to evaluate antibody responses in serum or with tetanus toxoid (TT) to measure the mucosal antibody response in gut contents. Control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. Overall, BSA and SRBC induced a detectable antibody response as early as week 1 postimmunization (p.i.), which lasted until week 3 p.i. Probiotic-treated birds had significantly (P <or= 0.001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin M [IgM]) to SRBC than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. However, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum IgM and IgG antibody responses to BSA. Immunization with TT resulted in the presence of specific IgA and IgG antibody responses in the gut. Again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the antibody response in the gut. In conclusion, probiotics enhance the systemic antibody response to some antigens in chickens, but it remains to be seen whether probiotics have an effect on the generation of the mucosal antibody response.
TI  - The role of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in identification of microorganisms misidentified by conventional methods.
AB  - Traditional methods for microbial identification require the recognition of differences in morphology, growth, enzymatic activity, and metabolism to define genera and species. Full and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods have emerged as useful tools for identifying phenotypically aberrant microorganisms. We report on three bacterial blood isolates from three different College of American Pathologists-certified laboratories that were referred to ARUP Laboratories for definitive identification. Because phenotypic identification suggested unusual organisms not typically associated with the submitted clinical diagnosis, consultation with the Medical Director was sought and further testing was performed including partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. All three patients had endocarditis, and conventional methods identified isolates from patients A, B, and C as a Facklamia sp., Eubacterium tenue, and a Bifidobacterium sp. 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified the isolates as Enterococcus faecalis, Cardiobacterium valvarum, and Streptococcus mutans, respectively. We conclude that the initial identifications of these three isolates were erroneous, may have misled clinicians, and potentially impacted patient care. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a more objective identification tool, unaffected by phenotypic variation or technologist bias, and has the potential to reduce laboratory errors.
TI  - Acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. The results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. E. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. Both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. Most E. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. One E. faecalis as well as one E. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (MIC > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. The results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. It is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the LEADER 2004 surveillance program.
AB  - Since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has been gained. However, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the United States has not been reported. The LEADER 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. Organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 Staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 428 Enterococcus faecalis, 196 Enterococcus faecium, and 422 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All S. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 = 2 microg/ml); MIC distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. For CNS, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered (Staphylococcus epidermidis; MIC = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the MIC(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with S. aureus. For E. faecalis and E. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. Both species had an MIC90 of 2 microg/ml, and MIC distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. Linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the S. pneumoniae isolates. These findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. Nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.
TI  - Slaughterhouse survey of pyelonephritis in dairy cows.
AB  - Twenty-one rejected kidneys from 2426 slaughtered dairy cows (0.87 per cent) had  gross signs of pyelonephritis that were confirmed by histopathology. In all the kidneys the findings were consistent with a chronic rather than an acute infection. One species of bacteria was cultured from 12 of the kidneys and two species of bacteria were cultured from six. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, from eight kidneys, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, from seven kidneys and Corynebacterium renale, from five kidneys. The other bacteria cultured were Corynebacterium cystitidis, Corynebacterium species, Streptococcus species group G and Enterococcus faecalis. E. coli was cultured from all the kidneys from which two species were isolated; the accompanying bacteria were A. pyogenes in three kidneys, C. renale in two and C. cystitidis in one. No bacteria were cultured from two of the kidneys and no significant bacteria were cultured from another. The kidneys with pyelonephritis were slightly larger than a comparison group of 72 kidneys without nephritis.
TI  - Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  - In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of acute otitis media and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate versus azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common acute bacterial infection in childhood and also the most frequent reason for outpatient antibiotic therapy. Little recent information about susceptibility patterns of AOM bacterial pathogens in Turkish children has been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial etiology of acute otitis media in children and to compare the efficiency of 3 days course of azithromycin with a 10 days course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. METHODS: This prospective, single blind, randomised comparative study was carried out in 180 children with AOM. Paracentesis was performed for middle ear fluid culture before the first dose antibiotic therapy. Children with acute otitis media were randomised to receive either low dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (45/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days) or low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg/day for 3 days). Clinical response was assessed on days 2-4, 11-13, 26-28. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 108 (60%) of 180 children. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolated pathogen (39.7%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (20.7%), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (5.1%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (1.7%). This study demonstrated low resistance rates compared to studies of different countries. Although clinical response rates were better in patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate, this was not statistically significant [86.6% (78 of 90)] versus [95.2% (80 of 84)]. Success rates of amoxicillin-clavulanate were high for both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Difference between success rates was not statistically significant (P=0.144 and 0.352). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were isolated in 60% of AOM cases. The clinical efficiency of amoxicillin-clavulanate was found to be equal compared to azithromycin in children with acute otitis media.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against clinical strains of indicated species isolated in North American medical centers (2003).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, groups A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. We evaluated the daptomycin spectrum against these pathogens by testing 2759 clinical strains consecutively collected in more than 30 hospitals located across the United States and Canada. The isolates were susceptibility tested against daptomycin and many comparators by the reference broth microdilution method. Daptomycin was very active against indicated species with the highest MIC results being 1, 2, and 0.5 microg/mL for S. aureus, E. faecalis, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, respectively. All isolates tested were considered susceptible to daptomycin, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and FDA breakpoints, and daptomycin was the most potent (lowest MIC90) among selected antimicrobials commonly used to treat Gram-positive infections. Resistance to oxacillin or vancomycin did not influence daptomycin activity against S. aureus or E. faecalis.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - Pulvinones as bacterial cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors.
AB  - Pulvinones were synthesized (>180) in arrays and evaluated as inhibitors of early stage cell wall biosynthesis enzymes MurA-MurD. Several pulvinones inhibited Mur enzymes with IC(50)'s in the 1-10 microg/mL range and demonstrated antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Disinfection of gutta-percha cones with chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHX) or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in disinfecting gutta-percha cones, to verify contamination of gutta-percha cones in their boxes, and to identify microorganisms after intentional contamination by handling cones. STUDY DESIGN: Gutta-percha cones contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms were left in contact with tested disinfecting solutions for different times, sterility of storage boxes was evaluated by immersing cones in broth medium, and the microorganisms most frequently found in handling cones were identified using biochemical tests. RESULTS: CHX was not effective in eliminating Bacillus subtilis spores on gutta-percha cones after 72 h of contact with the disinfecting substance. 5.25% NaOCl eliminated spores from gutta-percha after 1 min of disinfection. The cones evaluated from their boxes did not show contamination in 94.5% of the cases. The microbial genus most frequently found after intentional contamination with gloves was Staphylococcus. CONCLUSION: 5.25% NaOCl is an effective agent for a rapid disinfection of gutta-percha cones.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Spondylodiscitis after transvaginal oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilisation.
AB  - The frequency of iatrogenic spondylodiscitis is clearly increasing, which may reflect the increasing number of aggressive interventional procedures which may cause it. One of these is oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilisation. The authors describe a case of Streptococcus faecalis L5-S1 spondylodiscitis. Conservative treatment is the rule, but surgery may be indicated in specific cases such as the one presented.
TI  - [Bacterial flora and mycosis of the vagina in women with symptoms of vaginal inflammation].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the microbiological profile of vaginal flora in 30 women  with gynecologic problems and 20 pregnant women complaining about pathological symptoms {pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge}. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The discharge from posterior vaginal vault was examined microbiologically on the Columbia Agar with sheep blood, MacConkey and Sabourand cultures incubated of 48 hours in the temperature of 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bacterial infections were detected in 33 cases (66%), 12 of these women (24%) lived in urban, 21 (42%) in rural environment. From bacteria isolated from the vagina, most often because at 14 women stepped out Streptococcus agalactiae, at 11 Enterococcus faecalis at 8 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases bacterial inflammation was caused by two kinds of bacterium. At two women stepped out both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. In single cases it was Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. In all cases of inflammation mycosis was called out by from Candida albicans. One ascertained it at 14 among all given an examination women. Mixed inflammations called out both by mycosis and bacterial stepped out in 3 cases in age of 21-30. At two women it was Candida albicans and Streptococcus agalactiae, at one inflammation mycosis accompanied Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The common reason of vaginitis are bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, E coli. Both, place of living and women' s age influence the type of etiological factor.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Enumeration and speciation of enterococci found in marine and intertidal sediments and coastal water in southern California.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. High levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. Low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. Bacterial isolates presumptively identified as Enterococcus on mEI media were speciated. The predominant species found in both water and sediment included Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii. A number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mEI media were subsequently identified as species other than Enterococcus. At both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of Enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Novel copper(II) homobinuclear macrocyclic complexes: cyclic voltammetry, biological properties and spectral studies.
AB  - A series of five new copper(II) macrocyclic complexes have been synthesized by template condensation. The bonding and stereochemistry of the complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR, UV-visible, EPR spectral studies and electrochemical properties. g-Values are calculated for all of the complexes in polycrystalline form as well as in DMSO solution. The magnetic and spectral data indicate square planar geometry for all the complexes. Cyclic voltammograms for all the complexes are similar and involve two quasi-reversible redox processes. Cu(II)Cu(II)<=>Cu(II)Cu(I)<=>Cu(I)Cu(I). Their biological properties have also been studied. The macrocyclic complexes show more anti-bacterial than controlled one. The anti-bacterial activities of the compounds were tested against Streptococcus fecalis and Escherichia coli with different concentrations.
TI  - Identification of enterococcal, streptococcal and Weissella species in the faecal flora of individually owned dogs.
AB  - AIMS: To improve the limited information on the composition of the faecal Gram-positive coccal flora of healthy dogs by the use of a molecular identification method. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal swabs were collected for the selective isolation of Gram-positive coccal strains. Colonies with enterococcal- and streptococcal-like morphology were identified by tRNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tDNA-PCR). Fourteen known species belonging to three genera (Enterococcus, Streptococcus and Weissella) and one alleged new enterococcal species were found. CONCLUSIONS: The faecal flora of dogs comprises an unusually broad diversity of culturable Gram-positive coccal species with Enterococcus faecalis being most frequently present followed by not less than six other species of about equal importance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Many human- and animal-associated enterococci and streptococci are also present in dog faeces together with the largely uncharacterized Weissella cibaria and a group of strains resembling Enterococcus dispar, but representing a distinct and hitherto unknown species. Phenotypic characteristics of the latter two species were determined and the test results were compared with the species descriptions of W. cibaria and E. dispar respectively.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  - Repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. We used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. The agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10 [77%] of 13 cases).
TI  - Enhanced efficacy of single-dose versus multi-dose azithromycin regimens in preclinical infection models.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As a result of the prolonged half-life and unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characteristics of azithromycin, shorter dosing regimens are being evaluated for the treatment of community-acquired infections. To provide further support for a shorter dosing regimen, the efficacy of azithromycin was determined in preclinical infection models comparing single- versus multi-dose regimens. METHODS: The efficacy of single versus multi-dose regimens of azithromycin was compared in mouse pneumonia, acute peritonitis, and neutropenic thigh infection models and in a gerbil model of Haemophilus influenzae acute otitis media. Azithromycin was administered as a single oral dose on the first treatment day, or as two divided doses over 2 treatment days, or as three divided doses over 3 treatment days. The pharmacokinetics of azithromycin was profiled following single and multi-dose regimens with the single dose data fit to an Emax model to characterize the PK-PD of azithromycin. RESULTS: In the mouse efficacy models, administration of single-dose azithromycin produced superior rates of survival and bacterial clearance compared with the same total dose divided over 2 or 3 days. In the gerbil model, a single dose sterilized the middle ear and more rapidly cleared H. influenzae. The pharmacokinetic evaluation confirmed similar total exposure (AUC) in serum and pulmonary tissue for the three regimens. Correlation of PK-PD parameters and antimicrobial efficacy confirmed a concentration-dependent and dosing-independent relationship for azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with data reported from clinical studies and indicate that a single-dose regimen would be at least as effective as the same dose administered over several days.
TI  - Identification of essential genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae by allelic replacement mutagenesis.
AB  - To find potential targets of novel antimicrobial agents, we identified essential  genes of Streptococcus pneumoniae using comparative genomics and allelic replacement mutagenesis. We compared the genome of S. pneumoniae R6 with those of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, and selected 693 candidate target genes with > 40% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding genes in at least two of the other species. The 693 genes were disrupted and 133 were found to be essential for growth. Of these, 32 encoded proteins of unknown function, and we were able to identify orthologues of 22 of these genes by genomic comparisons. The experimental method used in this study is easy to perform, rapid and efficient for identifying essential genes of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and tightness of a DCPD-CaO-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. However, it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. In consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. By mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4 . 2H2O, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, DCPD) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a CPC with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. The setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (HA) or a mixture of HA and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of DCPD and CaO in the cement powder. The presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. The cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (Ca/P) of 1.67 to 2.75. A pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. Clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with Ca/P > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. With Ca/P = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. DCPD-CaO-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.
TI  - Analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in a Japanese hospital.
AB  - Prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (TC(R)) genes--tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(O), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(U)--which are known to be distributed to gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 Enterococcus faecalis and 46 Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a Japanese hospital. Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). Enterococcal strains with any one TC(R) gene or those with two TC(R) genes showed generally similar MICs of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance level was observed.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis sex pheromone plasmid pAM373: analyses of TraA and evidence for its interaction with RpoB.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM373 (36.7kb) encodes a mating response to the sex pheromone cAM373 secreted by recipient (plasmid-free) bacteria. Like certain other conjugative enterococcal plasmids, a key regulator of the pheromone response is a negatively acting protein, TraA, which is believed to interact with internalized pheromone to influence expression from a key transcriptional promoter P(0). An earlier report showed that in the case of pAM373 most, but not all, transposon-insertion mutations in traA differed from those in the case of pAD1 and pCF10 in that they did not give rise to the normally characteristic constitutive clumping. We show here that this phenomenon relates to a host effect involving an RpoB-related mutation associated with rifampin resistance. When harboring traA mutants, rifampin-sensitive hosts exhibited constitutive clumping, whereas rifampin-resistant hosts did not-despite the fact that the latter host exhibited a normal pheromone-inducible clumping response when harboring a wild-type plasmid. The data imply that TraA normally remains associated with the transcription complex after induction. In addition the promoter of traA, designated P(a), was shown to be located about 600bp upstream of the translational start site, as clones containing traA required this site to complement traA mutants in trans. Transcription from P(a) also gave rise to a short (130 nt) transcript, mD, expressed at a high level in uninduced cells. An earlier observation suggesting that TraA negatively affected transcriptional readthrough into the 3' end of traA from the t(ac) intrinsic bidirectional terminator between traA and the opposing, adjacent traC was supported by TraA complementation studies. Evidence is also presented suggesting that this regulation at t(ac) also involves an additional, possibly cis-acting, element.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis divIVA: an essential gene involved in cell division, cell growth and chromosome segregation.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis divIVA (divIVAEf) is an essential gene implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation. This gene was disrupted by insertional inactivation creating E. faecalis JHSR1, which was viable only when a wild-type copy of divIVAEf was expressed in trans, confirming the essentiality of the gene. The absence of DivIVAEf in E. faecalis JHSR1 inhibited proper cell division, which resulted in abnormal cell clusters possessing enlarged cells of altered shape instead of the characteristic diplococcal morphology of enterococci. The lower viability of the divIVAEf mutant is caused by improper nucleoid segregation and impaired septation within the numerous cells generated in each cluster. Overexpression of DivIVAEf in Escherichia coli KJB24 resulted in enlarged cells with disrupted cell division, suggesting that this round E. coli mutant strain could be used as an indicator for functionality of DivIVAEf. A Bacillus subtilis divIVA mutant was not complemented by DivIVAEf, indicating that this protein does not recognize DivIVA-specific target sites in B. subtilis, or that it does not interact with other proteins of the cell division machinery of this micro-organism. DivIVAEf also failed to complement a Streptococcus pneumoniae divIVA mutant, supporting the phylogenetic distance between Enterococcus and Streptococcus. Our results indicate that DivIVA is a species-specific multifunctional protein implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation in E. faecalis.
TI  - An antibacterial and antiviral peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans.
AB  - Enterococcus mundtii ST4V, isolated from soya beans, produces a 3950Da antibacterial peptide active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptide also inactivated the herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G), a polio virus (PV3, strain Sabin) and a measles virus (strain MV/BRAZIL/001/91, an attenuated strain of MV). MV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 95.5%-99.9% inactivated by peptide ST4V at 400 microg/ml. Monkey kidney Vero cells were not inactivated, even at four times the level peptide ST4V displayed antiviral activity, indicating that the effect was not due to cytotoxicity. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed after treatment of peptide ST4V with Proteinase K, pronase, pepsin and trypsin. No change in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, suggesting that peptide ST4V was not glycosylated. This is the first description of an antibacterial and antiviral peptide with such broad-spectrum of activity, produced by a lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of recent isolates from ophthalmological infections to gatifloxacin and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 240 isolates from the ophthalmological infections during July 2003 to March 2004 was determined to gatifloxacin (GFLX), levofloxacin, lomefloxacin and cefmenoxime applicable for ophthalmological infections. The in vitro activities of these drugs against the fresh isolates were compared. The quinolones including GFLX were potently active against Gram-positive bacteria, except for MRSA, a major causative pathogens for ophthalmological infection. When MIC ranges, MIC50 and MIC90 of three quinolones were compared, it was considered that the activity of GFLX was the most active of them. GFLX showed to be more active against opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa than other antimicrobial agents, and GFLX was especially potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, GFLX exhibits a potently active against fresh isolates from ophthalmological infections, and has an effective potential in the treatment of ophthalmological infections with the drug to administer eye drops.
TI  - Characterization of streptococci and enterococci associated with septicaemia in broiler parents with a high prevalence of endocarditis.
AB  - Increased mortality due to septicaemia, where 29% of the affected birds had developed valvular endocarditis, was observed in a flock of broiler parents affected by myelocytomatosis. Bacterial investigations resulted in isolation of streptococci, the classification of which was unknown according to present taxonomy. Strains were isolated from the liver, spleen, heart and salpinx in clinical cases of septicaemia from the affected flock of Ross broiler parents aged between 26 and 56 weeks. Phenotypic characterization followed by genotypic investigation by ribotyping with HindIII and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI demonstrated three ribotypes and six different PFGE profile types, respectively. Ribotype A with variant A1, together with the PFGE profile type represented by the three subtypes Ia, Ib and Ic, dominated the outbreak constituting 85% of the strains investigated, indicating clonality. 16S rRNA sequencing of strains representing this genotype demonstrated the occurrence of a recently described new Streptococcus sp., Streptococcus gallinaceus. Sequence analysis of the other genotypes demonstrated in the outbreak, resulted in identical 16S rRNA sequences to the type strain of Enterococcus faecalis. S. gallinaceus appears to represent a new opportunistic pathogen within the poultry industry.
TI  - Zygomatic abscess with temporal myositis - a rare extracranial complication of acute otitis media.
AB  - Acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and its early recognition and management still poses a challenge due to potentially serious consequences. The incidences of extracranial and intracranial suppurative complications of AOM in children have decreased significantly, yet they remain a serious clinical problem, especially when caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. The authors presented a case of rare AOM complication - zygomatic abscess with temporal myositis. A 6-year-old boy was admitted to the ENT Department with 4 weeks of ear pain, treated for AOM with cefuroxime axetyl and amoxicilline, with acute mastoiditis and subsequent abscess formation in zygomatic and preauricular region. The inflammatory process spread through anterior air cells to the zygomatic cells leading to a fistula formation in the zygomatic bone and breakthrough into the temporal muscle. The surgical procedures applied were: myringotomy with drainage, cortical mastoidectomy and revision of zygomatic area and treatment with antibiotics (ceftriaxon). Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus viridans were found in the culture of middle ear and mastoid effusion. After half a year of follow-up the child had a normal hearing. Severe complications of AOM are rare today. An early diagnosis in order to promote adequate management and prevent inherently suppurative complications is essential.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiologic and pathologic findings in an epidemic of equine pericarditis.
AB  - During the spring and summer of 2001 and in association with the mare reproductive loss syndrome, 22 terminal and 12 clinical cases of equine pericarditis were diagnosed in central Kentucky. Actinobacillus species were the principal isolates from 8 of 10 nontreated, terminally affected and 3 of 10 clinically affected horses. Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus zooepidemicus were cultured from the remaining 2 nontreated terminal cases. No viruses were isolated in tissue culture. Nucleic acid of equine herpesvirus-2 was detected in pericardial and tracheal wash fluids of 3 and 1 individuals, respectively. Microscopic alterations in sections of heart and parietal pericardium were consistent with chronic fibrinous bacterial pericarditis. This report confirms a significant role of Actinobacillus species in equine pericarditis and describes an epidemic of this infrequently observed syndrome in the horse.
TI  - Interlaboratory proficiency testing as a tool for improving performance in laboratories diagnosing bovine mastitis.
AB  - The National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (Finland) and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency of the Quality Assurance Unit, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, United Kingdom (previously the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) organized a proficiency testing program for laboratories analyzing veterinary mastitis samples. Three test samples with lyophilized strains of common aerobic bacteria were sent to the participating laboratories 7 times between 2000 and 2003. The participants returned 98% of the requested data. The overall performance of the laboratories varied from 63 to 93% in different testing rounds. All laboratories diagnosed Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli correctly at every round. Improvement in diagnosing individual bacteria was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. The overall performance of the laboratories improved with increased participation. The educational role of the program was important. Laboratories working in the veterinary field should implement a documented quality system covering all functions of the laboratory, as well as a planned quality assurance system.
TI  - Selection and characterization of a promoter for expression of single-copy recombinant genes in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past ten years there has been a growing interest in engineering Gram-positive bacteria for biotechnological applications, including vaccine delivery and production of recombinant proteins. Usually, bacteria are manipulated using plasmid expression vectors. The major limitation of this approach is due to the fact that recombinant plasmids are often lost from the bacterial culture upon removal of antibiotic selection. We have developed a genetic system based on suicide vectors on conjugative transposons allowing stable integration of recombinant DNA into the chromosome of transformable and non-transformable Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: The aim of this work was to select a strong chromosomal promoter from Streptococcus gordonii to improve this genetic system making it suitable for expression of single-copy recombinant genes. To achieve this task, a promoterless gene encoding a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat), was randomly integrated into the S. gordonii chromosome and transformants were selected for chloramphenicol resistance. Three out of eighteen chloramphenicol resistant transformants selected exhibited 100% stability of the phenotype and only one of them, GP215, carried the cat gene integrated as a single copy. A DNA fragment of 600 base pairs exhibiting promoter activity was isolated from GP215 and sequenced. The 5' end of its corresponding mRNA was determined by primer extention analysis and the putative -10 and a -35 regions were identified. To study the possibility of using this promoter (PP) for single copy heterologous gene expression, we created transcriptional fusions of PP with genes encoding surface recombinant proteins in a vector capable of integrating into the conjugative transposon Tn916. Surface recombinant proteins whose expression was controlled by the PP promoter were detected in Tn916-containing strains of S. gordonii and Bacillus subtilis after single copy chromosomal integration of the recombinant insertion vectors into the resident Tn916. The surface recombinant protein synthesized under the control of PP was also detected in Enterococcus faecalis after conjugal transfer of a recombinant Tn916 containing the transcriptional fusion. CONCLUSION: We isolated and characterized a S. gordonii chromosomal promoter. We demonstrated that this promoter can be used to direct expression of heterologous genes in different Gram-positive bacteria, when integrated in a single copy into the chromosome.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Construction and characterization of transposon TnphoZ for the identification of  genes encoding exported proteins in Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Bacterial virulence often depends on exported proteins. To identify genes encoding exported proteins in the neonatal pathogen, group B streptococcus, the transposon TnphoZ was constructed. Here, the coding sequence for the secretion-dependent enzyme alkaline phosphatase from Enterococcus faecalis was fused to the left terminal repeat of Tn917, generating TnphoZ. A collection of TnphoZ mutants was isolated and the DNA flanking the transposon insertion sites was sequenced. Sequence data correlated the expression of high AP activity with transposon insertion into genes encoding predicted exported proteins. It is anticipated that TnphoZ will be suitable for use in other Gram-positive hosts.
TI  - MIC quality control guidelines for doxycycline when testing gram-positive control strains by the reference methods.
AB  - With emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones, there arises a need to establish quality control (QC) guidelines for doxycycline, an effective alternative for treating various community-acquired respiratory tract infections. This multicenter study was performed to establish QC guidelines for susceptibility testing those Gram-positive QC organisms against doxycycline. The proposed three or four log2 dilution MIC ranges included 100.0% of the doxycycline MIC values reported.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from Shanghai, China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in Shanghai, China were determined and compared with selected comparators. Results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It was highly active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Tigecycline also had good activity against most strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it was poorly active against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Peptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. It was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Tigecycline was bactericidal against all Gram-positive cocci tested except Enterococcus spp. Inoculum size but not pH of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in China may have some effects on MIC values of tigecycline.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Activation of the complement system generates antibacterial peptides.
AB  - The complement system represents an evolutionary old and significant part of the  innate immune system involved in protection against invading microorganisms. Here, we show that the anaphylatoxin C3a and its inactivated derivative C3a-desArg are antibacterial, demonstrating a previously unknown direct antimicrobial effect of complement activation. The C3a peptide, as well as functional epitopes in the sequence, efficiently killed the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. In mice, a C3a-derived peptide suppressed infection by Gram-positive Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Fluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrated that C3a binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. C3a was also found to induce membrane leakage of liposomes. These findings provide an interesting link between the complement system and antimicrobial peptides, which are two important branches of innate immunity.
TI  - Potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Common Gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. New drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. Halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus Laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). In addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of MRSA at 3.13 microg mL(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus, at 3.13 microg mL(-1) and 6.25 microg mL(-1), respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive strains collected worldwide.
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide recently released for clinical use in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections in hospitalized patients. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against recently isolated multidrug-resistant Gram-positive clinical strains. A total of 386 isolates were selected from a large collection of strains from more than 70 centers located in Europe, North America, and South America. The strains were tested by reference broth microdilution methods in Mueller-Hinton broth with 50 mg/L Ca++ against daptomycin. Daptomycin was the most potent compound tested against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC50/90 values at < or =0.12 and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin was also highly active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococcal strains with various resistance patterns. Enterococcus faecium showed higher daptomycin MIC values (MIC90, 4 microg/mL) when compared to E. faecalis (MIC90, 1 microg/mL). In summary, resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or penicillin among the Gram-positive isolates did not adversely influence daptomycin activity. Daptomycin showed a significant potency and spectrum against Gram-positive species, including multidrug-resistant strains, and may represent a reasonable therapeutic option for infections caused by these important pathogens.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin compared with other quinolones against clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - Owing to the predominance of gram-positive pathogens in neutropenic cancer patients, newer generation quinolones with an expanded gram-positive spectrum and enhanced potency, may have a role to play for prophylaxis and/or empiric therapy in such patients. The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trovafloxacin against 848 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. Against gram-positive organisms, gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested inhibiting all Aerococcus, Listeria monocytogens, Micrococcus, Stomatococcus mucilaginous, Bacillus, and Rhodococcus equi strains at < or =2 mg/l, its designated susceptibility breakpoint. It was also very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. (including penicillin nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci). It had moderate activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, inhibiting 68-80% of these strains at < or =2 mg/l. Gatifloxacin also had good activity against the Enterobacteriaceae (although ciprofloxacin was more potent) inhibiting >95% of isolates at < or =1 mg/l. Nonfermentative gram-negative organisms were less susceptible to all 4 agents. Gatifloxacin was very active against Acinetobacter lwoffi (MIC100 0.12 mg/l) and had moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Chryseobacterium spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species. Alcaligenes xylosoxidans strains were relatively resistant to all 4 agents.
TI  - Characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of Tet(M)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  - Streptococcus oralis 264-3, Streptococcus mitis 254-1 and S. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(M) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline MICs of 2, 8 and 64 mg/L, respectively). The aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (Tc(R)) observed. Escherichia coli HB101 carrying the cloned tet(M) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (MICs of 1, 16, and 64 mg/L for tet(M) genes from S. oralis 264-3, S. mitis 254-1 and S. mitis 264-1, respectively). DNA sequencing revealed that S. oralis 264-3 had a tet(M) gene highly homologous to tet(M) carried by Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level Tc(R) strains had tet(M) sequences that resembled the tet(M) gene of Tn5251 from Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). No differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the Tet(M) proteins.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of ozonated water on bacteria invading dentinal tubules.
AB  - Ozone is known to act as a strong antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptcoccus mutans infections in vitro in bovine dentin. After irrigation with ozonated water, the viability of E. faecalis and S. mutans invading dentinal tubules significantly decreased. Notably, when the specimen was irrigated with sonication, ozonated water had nearly the same antimicrobial activity as 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). We also compared the cytotoxicity against L-929 mouse fibroblasts between ozonated water and NaOCl. The metabolic activity of fibroblasts was high when the cells were treated with ozonated water, whereas that of fibroblasts significantly decreased when the cells were treated with 2.5% NaOCl. These results suggest that ozonated water application may be useful for endodontic therapy.
TI  - Inhibition of antibiotic efflux in bacteria by the novel multidrug resistance inhibitors biricodar (VX-710) and timcodar (VX-853).
AB  - Inhibitors of mammalian multidrug efflux, such as the plant alkaloid reserpine, are also active in potentiating antibiotic activity by inhibiting bacterial efflux. Based on this precedent, two novel mammalian multiple drug resistance inhibitors, biricodar (VX-710) and timcodar (VX-853), were evaluated for activity in a variety of bacteria. Both VX-710 and VX-853 potentiated the activity of ethidium bromide (EtBr), a model efflux substrate, against three clinically significant gram-positive pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Similar to reserpine, VX-710 and VX-853 directly blocked EtBr efflux in S. aureus. Furthermore, these compounds were effective in lowering the MICs of several clinically used antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, suggesting that VX-710 and VX-853 are representatives of a new class of bacterial efflux inhibitors with the potential for use in combination therapy.
TI  - Alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. Bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (BHI-blood agar), adjusted to pH 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic glove box. Bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched BHI broth adjusted to pH 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16S rDNA sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. In the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. Bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard BHI-blood agars (pH 7.0) were used. Of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at pH 9.0 and 4 at pH 10.0. The alkali-resistant strains included Enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), Enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), Klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), Streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and Streptococcus mitis (2 strains). Three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus Firmicutes or Staphylococcus at the genus level. The present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at pH 9.0 and/or pH 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus Enterococcus.
TI  - Nocathiacin I analogues: synthesis, in vitro and in vivo biological activity of novel semi-synthetic thiazolyl peptide antibiotics.
AB  - Several nocathiacin I analogues (4-35) were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity. Most of these semi-synthetic analogues retained very good in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of 1.
TI  - Review of 65 cases of infective endocarditis in Dunedin Public Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infective endocarditis remains a challenging disease to manage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the management of patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis presenting to a regional hospital. METHODS: During the years 1997 to 2002, 65 episodes of bacterial endocarditis in 62 patients (20 female, 42 male; age range from 7-89 yrs, median 68 yrs) classified as definite or possible according to the Duke criteria were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic data, predisposing factors, echocardiographic findings, culture results, complications and mortality were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Forty-five episodes (69%) were definite endocarditis and 20 episodes (31%) were possible endocarditis. All cases had undergone transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiograms with vegetations found in 59 (91%) episodes. There were 49 cases of native valve endocarditis, 21 (34%) of whom had either congenital or acquired valvular disease. Fifteen cases (23%) were prosthetic valve endocarditis. One case was automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads endocarditis. Preceding dental or surgical manipulation was observed in 7 cases (11%). Aortic valve (38/59, 64%) was the most common valve involved followed by mitral valve (21/59, 36%). Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 20 episodes (31%), Streptococcus viridans for 16 episodes (25%), Enterococcus faecalis for 5 episodes (8%), other organisms for 9 episodes (14%), and culture negative endocarditis (CNE) for 15 episodes (23%). The majority of the cases had single valve involvement (50/59, 85%); only 9 cases (15%) were double valve endocarditis. Ten cases (15%) needed urgent valve replacement. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20% (13/65), and at 6 months was 31% (20/65). Higher 6-month mortality was seen in patients with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis or CNE. CONCLUSIONS: Despite major advances in diagnostic technology, improvement in antimicrobial selection and monitoring, and progress in surgical techniques, the morbidity and mortality of bacterial endocarditis remain high.
TI  - Use of simulated blood cultures for antibiotic effect on time to detection of the two blood culture systems BacT/ALERT and BACTEC 9240.
AB  - To avoid the influence of pre-analytical steps, this study was performed using sterile blood spiked with defined loads of microorganisms as inoculum. Time-to-Detection (TTD) was evaluated for the most frequently encountered bacteria comparing two commercially available blood culture systems, BD BACTEC 9240 (Becton Dickinson) and BacT/ALERT (Organon Teknika). The effect of the most widely used antibiotics on TTD was evaluated on both systems. TTD was measured with antibiotics at their trough and at increasing concentrations. The results show that the BACTEC PLUS system recovers more pathogens with shorter time to detection than the BacT/ALERT FAN system when beta-lactam antibiotics (Ampicillin, Cefotaxime) are present at their respective trough concentration corresponding to parenteral therapy. The two systems seem to be equally efficient when Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are used; in the case of Vancomycin, BACTEC seems more effective than BacT/ALERT.
TI  - Tissue-specific adherent Enterococcus faecalis strains that show highly efficient adhesion to human bladder carcinoma T24 cells also adhere to extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - The ability of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates to adhere to immobilized extracellular matrixes (ECMs) coating the walls of microtiter plates was examined by microscopy. The ECMs consisted of fibronectin, laminin, collagen types I, II, IV, and V, fibrinogen, and lactoferrin. With the exception of fibrinogen, each isolate showed a different level of adherence to each of the ECMs. No significant level of adherence to fibrinogen was observed for any isolate. The tissue-specific adhesive strains AS11, AS12, AS14, AS15, HT11, and HT12, which showed highly efficient adherence to human bladder carcinoma T24 cells and human bladder epithelial cells, showed strong adherence to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type I, II, IV, and V ECMs, and the levels were greater than 10(4) cells/mm2 of well surface coated by ECM. None of the isolates that showed little adherence to human bladder carcinoma T24 cells showed efficient adherence to all the ECMs. The levels of adherence of gelatinase-producing isolates to the collagens were lower than the levels of adherence of gelatinase-negative isolates. When tissue-specific adhesive strains that adhered strongly to each ECM were preincubated with fibronectin, the adherence of the strains to fibronectin was inhibited, but the adherence of the strains to collagen type IV was not inhibited. Likewise, preincubation with collagen type IV inhibited adherence to collagen type IV but not adherence to fibronectin. All of the E. faecalis isolates were shown to carry the ace gene by PCR analysis performed with specific primers for collagen binding domain A of ace. The ace gene encodes Ace (adhesin of collagen from enterococci). The prtF gene of group A streptococci, which encodes the fibronectin binding protein of group A streptococci, was not detected in the tissue-specific adhesive strains by Southern analysis performed with the prtF probe of the Streptococcus pyogenes JRS4 strain. Mutants with altered collagen binding were isolated by insertion of Tn916 into the chromosome of tissue-specific adhesive strain AS14. The number of mutant adhesive bacterial cells that adhered to collagen and also to laminin was 1 or 2 orders lower than the number observed for the wild-type strain, but the level of adherence to fibronectin remained the same as that of the wild-type strain.
TI  - Gram-positive merA gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  - Clinical mercury resistant (Hg(r)) Gram-negative bacteria carrying Gram-positive  mercury reductase (merA)-like genes were characterized using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR and sequencing. A PCR assay was developed which discriminated between the merA genes related to Staphylococcus and those related to the Bacillus/Streptococcus merA genes by the difference in size of the PCR product. DNA sequence analysis correlated with the PCR assay. The merA genes from Acinetobacter junii, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the Staphylococcus aureus MerA protein. A fourth merA gene, from Pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the Streptococcus oralis MerA protein. All the Hg(r) Gram-negative bacteria transferred their Gram-positive merA genes to a Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants expressing mercury resistance. These Gram-positive merA genes join Gram-positive tetracycline resistance and Gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - An in-vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of nisin in root canals and canal wall radicular dentine.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether nisin, a bacteriocin, would be effective at killing Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus gordonii cells in solution and within the root canal system. METHODOLOGY: Bacterial isolates of E. faecalis and S. gordonii were grown from glycerol stocks in closed tubes containing BHY broth at 37 degrees C. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of nisin for both bacterial species was determined by a microdilution method. Extracted human teeth were decoronated to produce roots of equal length with a single canal and divided into six groups of 10 roots. The canals were prepared to a master apical size 30 file using 0.04 taper Ni-Ti rotary instruments. Bacterial samples of each species were inoculated into three groups of prepared roots and incubated in closed tubes at 37 degrees C for 21 days. The root canals in each group were then medicated with water (control), calcium hydroxide powder mixed with sterile water [Ca(OH)2], or nisin and incubated for a further 7 days. Rotary Ni-Ti files were used to take radicular dentine samples from the walls of each canal which were then incubated in BHY broth for 24 h. Optical density (OD600) readings were taken as a measure of bacterial growth. RESULTS: The MBC of nisin for E. faecalis and S. gordonii was 70 and 20 mg mL(-1) respectively. Calcium hydroxide and nisin medication eradicated infection within the root canal while cells remained viable in the control group. Mean optical density (OD600) readings from canal wall dentine shavings infected with E. faecalis were 1.32 +/- 0.98, 0.73 +/- 0.27 and 0.69 +/- 0.38 for the control, Ca(OH)2 and nisin samples respectively. Corresponding mean readings for S. gordonii were 1.19 +/- 0.18, 0.73 +/- 0.15 and 0.60 +/- 0.29. The Ca(OH)2 and nisin group readings were significantly (P < 0.01) lower than the control for each species as tested by Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U statistical analysis. Values for Ca(OH)2 and nisin were not significantly (P > 0.01) different. CONCLUSION: Nisin was effective at eradicating E. faecalis and S. gordonii cells in pure culture and was comparable with Ca(OH)2 in the elimination of these species from within the root canal system.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: Endo Fill, Endomethasone, Endomethasone N, Sealer 26 and AH-Plus, against the following microorganisms: Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces naeslundii. The sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.The direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. The results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, Endo-Fill and Endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. Sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. At all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. In conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon the microbial susceptibility to them.
TI  - Sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT FA-medium for detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood cultures and its temperature-dependence.
AB  - The BacT/ALERT FA-medium was evaluated to detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. As published previously its predecessor the BacT/ALERT FAN-medium failed to detect P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. It is now reported that FA-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees C, i.e. 8 h, before detection of P. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. In clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning P. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (FAN-medium) to 9.1 % (FA-medium). If media inoculated with P. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. Various micro-organisms (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C. It is concluded that FA-medium detects P. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation at 36 degrees C.
TI  - Retrieving sequences of enzymes experimentally characterized but erroneously annotated : the case of the putrescine carbamoyltransferase.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Annotating genomes remains an hazardous task. Mistakes or gaps in such a complex process may occur when relevant knowledge is ignored, whether lost, forgotten or overlooked. This paper exemplifies an approach which could help to resuscitate such meaningful data. RESULTS: We show that a set of closely related sequences which have been annotated as ornithine carbamoyltransferases are actually putrescine carbamoyltransferases. This demonstration is based on the following points : (i) use of enzymatic data which had been overlooked, (ii) rediscovery of a short NH2-terminal sequence allowing to reannotate a wrongly annotated ornithine carbamoyltransferase as a putrescine carbamoyltransferase, (iii) identification of conserved motifs allowing to distinguish unambiguously between the two kinds of carbamoyltransferases, and (iv) comparative study of the gene context of these different sequences. CONCLUSIONS: We explain why this specific case of misannotation had not yet been described and draw attention to the fact that analogous instances must be rather frequent. We urge to be especially cautious when high sequence similarity is coupled with an apparent lack of biochemical information. Moreover, from the point of view of genome annotation, proteins which have been studied experimentally but are not correlated with sequence data in current databases qualify as "orphans", just as unassigned genomic open reading frames do. The strategy we used in this paper to bridge such gaps in knowledge could work whenever it is possible to collect a body of facts about experimental data, homology, unnoticed sequence data, and accurate informations about gene context.
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics of telavancin (TD-6424), a novel bactericidal agent, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Telavancin (TD-6424) is a novel lipoglycopeptide that produces rapid and concentration-dependent killing of clinically relevant gram-positive organisms in vitro. The present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of telavancin in the mouse neutropenic thigh (MNT) and mouse subcutaneous infection (MSI) animal models. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the MNT model demonstrated that the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC ratio was the best predictor of efficacy. Telavancin produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The 50% effective dose (ED50) estimates for telavancin ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 mg/kg of body weight (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log10 CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against MRSA ATCC 33591, telavancin was 4- and 30-fold more potent (on an ED50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. Against MSSA ATCC 13709, telavancin was 16- and 40-fold more potent than vancomycin and nafcillin, respectively. Telavancin, vancomycin, and linezolid were all efficacious and more potent against MRSA ATCC 33591 in the MSI model compared to the MNT model. This deviation in potency was, however, disproportionately greater for vancomycin and linezolid than for telavancin, suggesting that activity of telavancin is less affected by the immune status. The findings of these studies collectively suggest that once-daily dosing of telavancin may provide an effective approach for the treatment of clinically relevant infections with gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Impact of susceptibility to antibiotics of streptococci & enterococci isolated from patients with infective endocarditis on antibiotic treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Streptococci and enterococci are the most frequent pathogens causing infective endocarditis. In order to update the recommendations for both curative and prophylaxis treatment, the susceptibility to antibiotics of the most prevalent species of Streptococcaceae isolated from the patients with infective endocarditis was determined. METHODS: Streptococcal and enterococcal isolates (n=133) isolated from confirmed cases of infective endocarditis during a one-year prospective survey conducted in 1999 in France were studied. The identification of 106 streptococci and 27 enterococci to the species level was carried out by conventional methods. Their susceptibility to ten antibiotics used in curative or prophylactic treatment was measured. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method. RESULTS: All the streptococcal and enterococcal isolates were susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of penicillin or amoxicillin. High levels of resistance to aminoglycosides were observed in two species, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis. All isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and pristinamycin was restricted to some species. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Curative treatments recommended for streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis, including penicillin, amoxicillin or vancomycin in association with gentamicin were found to be appropriate for 98.5 per cent of cases. The emergence of erythromycin resistance in oral streptococci led to the use of pristinamycin in oral prophylactic treatment in patients allergic to beta-lactams.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in European Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against European Gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). The MIC(90)-values of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecium 8 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. Based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/L for S. aureus and group A streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. Based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/L for vancomcyin-susceptible E. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction identification of microorganisms in previously root-filled teeth in a South Korean population.
AB  - A large body of evidence indicates that microorganisms are the primary causative  agents of endodontic treatment failures. This study intended to assess the occurrence of nine putative endodontic pathogens in root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions in a South Korean population using a culture-independent molecular approach. Fourteen root-filled teeth with persistent periradicular diseases were selected for retreatment. After removal of the root canal filling, the canals were sampled, and a polymerase chain reaction assay using taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers was used for microbial detection. Bacteria were present in all cases, as revealed by amplification using ubiquitous 16S rDNA primers. The most frequently detected taxon was Enterococcus faecalis (64%), followed by Streptococcus spp. (21%) and Tannerella forsythensis (14%). The results of this study using a highly sensitive identification method are concurrent with those from other geographical locations using diverse identification methods in that E. faecalis is the main species found in cases of root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infective endocarditis complicating liver cirrhosis is infrequently reported. This study evaluated the clinical features of infective endocarditis in Taiwanese patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: All cases of infective endocarditis occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis from December 1995 to December 2002 were included in this study. Data were collected by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Twenty six patients (18 males, 8 females) with median age 6 years (range, 43 to 87) were included. The etiology of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis virus infection in 20 patients. There were 7 nosocomial infections. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 25 patients, with Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), viridans streptococci (n = 4), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2) the most common isolates. The hospital mortality rate was 27%. Patients with in-hospital death were more likely to have a history of uremia, staphylococcal infection, nosocomial infection and less likely to have aortic valve infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with infective endocarditis and liver cirrhosis was poor. Infection with Staphylococcus species was a dominant cause and methicillin resistance was common.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of a novel series of potent DNA gyrase inhibitors. Pyrazole derivatives.
AB  - We have previously found that a pyrazole derivative 1 possesses antibacterial activity and inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Here, we synthesized new pyrazole derivatives and found that 5-[(E)-2-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)vinyl]pyrazole 16 possesses potent antibacterial activity and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial topoisomerases. Many of the synthesized pyrazole derivatives were potent against clinically isolated quinolone- or coumarin-resistant Gram-positive strains and had minimal inhibitory concentration values against these strains equivalent to those against susceptible strains.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of O-substituted nocathiacin I derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of a series of new nocathiacin I derivatives (1-12) containing polar water solubilizing groups is described. Most of these compounds exhibited potent antibacterial activity and have improved water solubility. In addition, compounds 5, 7-9 also exhibited potent in vivo activity.
TI  - [Streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. Although it is usually considered to have low virulence, S. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. On the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by S. salivarius, S. mitis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. We report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. Cerebrospinal cultures grew S. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. The patient was successfully treated with penicillin G and left the hospital without sequelae. In the literature, bacterial meningitis due to S. salivarius is rarely reported. Of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. We discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to S. salivarius cases reports. The early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - [Effect of urinary tract infections in children with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) in children on dialysis treatment are regarded as  indirect contraindication for kidney transplantation. In medication of UTI it is recommended to prescribe antibacterial agent in proper dosage (often in reduced amount) and to choose desired drug in selected period of chronic renal failure (CRF). THE AIM: of the study was the evaluation of UTI incidence in children and adolescents with terminal renal failure on peritoneal dialysis treatment (PD), kind of isolated bacterial strains and their current drug-sensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 26 children and young adults (15 girls and 11 boys) on PD for the period longer than 6 months (mean 2.0+/-1.5 years). The mean age of examined children was 13.2+/-4.4 years. Total number of 57 culture-positive UTI episodes were recorded (30 in girls, 27 in boys)--1-episode/11.1 patient-month. In examined group UTI most frequently were present in children with uncorrected urinary tract malformation (1 episode/7.7 patient-month) and in children on immunosuppressive treatment (1 episode/5.7 patient-month). In children with cystic kidney disease infections had accidental character. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent occurring pathogen was bacteria Escherichia coli--13 (22.8%) and Streptococcus faecalis--13 (22.8%) infections. E. coli strains shown sensitivity to second generation of quinolones: ciprofloxacin; third generation of cephalosporin: ceftazidime; partial sensitivity to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, aminoglycosides. Streptococcus faecalis strains revealed only partial sensitivity to nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, teicoplanin.
TI  - In vitro modeling of dental water line contamination and decontamination.
AB  - The contamination of dental unit water lines (DUWL) is an emerging concern in dentistry. The aim of this study was to use an in vitro DUWL to model microbial contamination and evaluate the decontamination efficacy of tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) solutions. A DUWL biofilm model used to simulate clinical conditions was used to generate a range of biofilms in DUWL. Three distinct biofilms were generated: (1) biofilm from water, (2) biofilm from a mix of water + contaminating human commensal bacteria, (3) biofilm from water with contaminating oral bacteria added after biofilm formed. The contaminating oral species used were Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Decontamination by simple water flushing or flushing with TAED was evaluated (2, 5 and 10 min intervals). The DUWL tubes were split and samples were plated onto a range of media, incubated and bacteria enumerated. Water flushing did not reduce the number of microorganisms detected. Bacteria were not detected from any of the TAED sampling points for any of the biofilm types tested. Interestingly, if contamination was introduced to new DUWL along with the waterborne species a biofilm was formed containing only the waterborne species. If however, an existing biofilm was present before the introduction of "contaminating" bacteria then these could be detected in the biofilm. This implies that if the DUWL are new or satisfactorily cleaned on a regular basis then the associated cross-contamination aspects are reduced. In conclusion, TAED provides effective control for DUWL biofilms.
TI  - Traditional medicine in north Cote-d'Ivoire: screening of 50 medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in North Cote-d'Ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on Gram positive bacteria. Of these, 10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin M, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin B. The most active was Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae) followed by Bobgunnia madagascariensis (Desv.) J.H. Kirkbr. & Wiersema (Caesalpinaceae), Waltheria lanceolata R. Br. ex Mast. (Sterculiaceae), Uapaca togoensis Pax. (Euphorbiaceae), Ximenia americana L. (Olacaceae), Khaya senegalensis (Ders.) A. Juss. (Meliaceae), Lannea acida A. Rich. (Anacardiaceae), Cissus populnea Guill. & Perr. (Vitaceae), Keetia hispida (Benth.) Bridson (Rubiaceae) and Ficus thonningii (Miq.) A. Rich. (Moraceae). This is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. The results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - An evaluation of microbial leakage in roots filled with a thermoplastic synthetic polymer-based root canal filling material (Resilon).
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare bacterial leakage using Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis through gutta-percha and a thermoplastic synthetic polymer-based root filling (Resilon) using two filling techniques during a 30-day period. Teeth were decoronated, roots prepared to a length of 16 mm, and instrumented to ISO sizes 40 to 50. A total of 156 roots were randomly divided into 8 groups of 15 roots (groups 1-8) and 3 control groups (12 roots each). Roots were filled using lateral and vertical condensation techniques with gutta-percha and AH 26 sealer (groups 1 and 2) or with gutta-percha and Epiphany sealer (groups 3 and 4). Groups 5 and 6 were filled with Resilon and Epiphany sealer using the lateral or vertical condensation techniques. A split chamber microbial leakage model was used in which S. mutans placed in the upper chamber could reach the lower chamber only through the filled canal. Groups 7 and 8 were identical to groups 5 and 6 respectively; however, E. faecalis was used to test the leakage. Positive controls were filled with Resilon (12 roots) and gutta-percha (12 roots) without sealer and tested with bacteria, whereas negative controls (12 roots) were sealed with wax to test the seal between chambers. All but one positive control leaked within 24 h, whereas none of the negative controls leaked. Resilon showed minimal leakage (group 8: one leakage; groups 5-7: each with two leakages), which was significantly less than gutta-percha, in which approximately 80% of specimens with either technique or sealer leaked. Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistical significance when all groups were compared (p < 0.05). Mann-Whitney U test compared the respective groups and found Resilon groups superior to gutta-percha groups (p < 0.05).
TI  - In vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AC98-6446, a novel cyclic glycopeptide,  in experimental infection models.
AB  - AC98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic derivative of a natural product related to the mannopeptimycins produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Naturally occurring esterified mannopeptimycins exhibited excellent in vitro activity but only moderate in vivo efficacy against staphylococcal infection. The in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AC98-6446 were investigated in murine acute lethal, bacterial thigh and rat endocarditis infections. Pharmacokinetics were performed in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs. Acute lethal infections were performed with several gram-positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The 50% effective dose for all isolates tested ranged from 0.05 to 0.39 mg/kg of body weight after intravenous (i.v.) administration. Vancomycin was more than fivefold less efficacious against all of these same infections. Results of the thigh infection with S. aureus showed a static dose for AC98-6446 of 0.4 mg/kg by i.v. administration. Reduction of counts in the thigh of >2 log(10) CFU were achieved with doses of 1 mg/kg. i.v. administration of 3 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days resulted in a >3 log(10) reduction in bacterial counts of vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecalis in a rat endocarditis model. Pharmacokinetics of AC98-6446 showed an increase in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) from mouse to dog species. The i.v. half-life (t(1/2)) increased threefold between rodents and the higher species dosed. Efficacy of AC98-6446 has been demonstrated in several models of infection with resistant gram-positive pathogens. This glycopeptide exhibited bactericidal activity in these models, resulting in efficacy at low doses with reduction in bacterial load.
TI  - Preliminary evaluation of bioactive glass S53P4 as an endodontic medication in vitro.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. In this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with Enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) powder suspension. While calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the BAG suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. In a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the BAG-killing efficacy against E. faecalis ATCC29212, Candida albicans CCUG19915, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC10556, and S. mutans ATCC25175. BAG placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin pH. Consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not pH-mediated. Further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial BAG effect in the presence of dentin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among Gram-positive pathogens: the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) programme, 2000.
AB  - In the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance programme, isolates were collected from 21 hospitals over a 3-month period in 2000 (TSAR II) and rates of resistance in Gram-positive pathogens were determined. Resistance rates were high including oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (60%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (80%), high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in Enterococcus faecalis (60%) and penicillin non-susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae (69%). Oxacillin resistance had increased from 1998 (TSAR I) and may be spreading into outpatient settings. In contrast, less than 2% enterococci were vancomycin-resistant. No linezolid resistance was found in either staphylococci or enterococci.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Potential utility of a peptide deformylase inhibitor (NVP PDF-713) against oxazolidinone-resistant or streptogramin-resistant Gram-positive organism isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potency of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, NVP PDF-713, against Gram-positive organisms having resistances to linezolid or quinupristin/dalfopristin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 45 strains from three genera (six species groups) were tested by reference broth microdilution methods. The mechanism of resistance to the oxazolidinone was determined by sequencing of the gene encoding the ribosomal target. RESULTS: NVP PDF-713 retained activity against linezolid-resistant staphylococci (MIC range 0.25-2 mg/L), Streptococcus oralis (MIC 0.5 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC range 2-4 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC range 0.5-4 mg/L). Quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium (MIC range 1-2 mg/L) and staphylococci (MIC range 0.12-2 mg/L) were also inhibited by NVP PDF-713. Many (10 of 13 strains) of the linezolid-resistant enterococci were resistant to vancomycin and these clinical strains had a G2576U ribosomal target mutation. CONCLUSIONS: NVP PDF-713 appears to be a promising clinical candidate among the peptide deformylase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms that possess resistances to oxazolidinones or streptogramin combinations.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  - According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of Perugia University. Between May 2000 and April 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years: 355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) ASA score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. A total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (E. coli 3, Acinetobacter baumannii 2, Providencia stuartii 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Achromobacter spp. 1, Citrobacter freundii 1, Morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, Enterococcus faecalis 2, Streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (S. aureus meticillin resistant 4, S. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, Staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, Clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). Patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. We can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.
TI  - Activity of linezolid against Gram-positive cocci isolated in French hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  - In total, 844 strains of Gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in France between September 1999 and January 2000. MICs of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method A); (ii) by broth microdilution (method B) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by Etest (method E) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. MIC50 and MIC90 values were identical (2 mg/L) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods A and B. Linezolid was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 117), with an MIC90 of 2 mg/L (methods A and B), but with a lower MIC50 of 1 mg/L by method A. Of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. Linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods A and B (MIC50 and MIC90 values of 1-2 mg/L), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. The MIC90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 Enterococcus faecalis and 50 Enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/L by both methods. MICs of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/L (method A) and 0.125-2 mg/L (method E). Pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin G-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/L (MIC90 of 2 mg/L by methods A and E). No strain had an MIC of > 2 mg/L by agar dilution or Etest, or of > 4 mg/L by broth microdilution. Overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of MICs for Gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - Controlled autolysis and enzyme release in a recombinant lactococcal strain expressing the metalloendopeptidase enterolysin A.
AB  - This study concerns the exploitation of the lytic enzyme enterolysin A (EntL), produced by Enterococcus faecalis strain DPC5280, to elicit the controlled autolysis of starter lactococci. EntL, a cell wall metalloendopeptidase secreted by some E. faecalis strains, can kill a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including lactococci. The controlled expression of entL, which encodes EntL, was achieved using a nisin-inducible expression system in a lactococcal host. Zymographic analysis of EntL activity demonstrated that active enzyme is produced by the recombinant lactococcal host. Indeed, expression of EntL resulted in almost complete autolysis of the host strain 2 h after induction with nisin. Model cheese experiments using a starter strain in addition to the inducible enterolysin-producing strain showed a 27-fold increase in activity with respect to the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the strain overexpressing EntL, demonstrating the potential of EntL production in large-scale cheese production systems. Indeed, the observation that a wide range of lactic bacteria are sensitive to EntL suggests that EntL-induced autolysis has potential applications with a variety of lactic acid bacteria and could be a basis for probiotic delivery systems.
TI  - New antibacterial agents derived from the DNA gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  - Cyclothialidine (1, Ro 09-1437) is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from Streptomyces filipinensis NR0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. It acts by competitively inhibiting the ATPase activity exerted by the B subunit of DNA gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the cytoplasmic membrane. To explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. From a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (SAR) were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (X) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for DNA gyrase inhibitory activity. The variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (XI). On the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. By improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.
TI  - Clinafloxacin for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - We report the results of a prospective, multicenter trial assessing intravenous and oral clinafloxacin treatment for infective endocarditis. Sixty-six patients constituted the final study population. Among the 53 patients with native valve infection, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were the most common pathogens. Twelve patients with native valve infection required surgery, at which time all valve tissue culture results were negative. The overall success rate for native valve infection was 87%. Single valves were involved in 11 of 13 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), and multiple valves were involved in 2 cases. Enterococcus faecalis was the most common pathogen, causing 4 of the PVE cases. The overall success rate for treatment of PVE was 69%. Patients with PVE who did not respond to treatment presented with complications that predict poor prognosis. Clinafloxacin may be effective for both native and PVE, but further studies are indicated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of AC98-6446, a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide  derivative of the natural product mannopeptimycin alpha, and other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - AC98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (AC98-1). In the present study the activity of AC98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. AC98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). AC98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (MIC(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (MIC(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). AC98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) CFU/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) CFU/ml). Unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, AC98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. The potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by AC98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.
TI  - DNA binding ligands targeting drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Part 1: Internal benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel DNA minor-groove binding ligands with a promising antibacterial profile are described. Apart from excellent in vitro potency against multiple Gram-positive bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), a small subset of compounds was active against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli).
TI  - Daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibacterial with rapid in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci. It is approved for use in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by specified Gram-positive cocci. In vitro, daptomycin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, group C and G beta-haemolytic streptococci and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Bactericidal activity in vitro was rapid and concentration dependent. In two randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trials in patients with cSSSIs, intravenous daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was as effective as standard therapy (intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin 4-12 g/day or vancomycin 1 g 12-hourly). Clinical success rates assessed 6-20 days after treatment end were 82.1% in daptomycin recipients and 82.9% in recipients of standard therapy (pooled data). In patients with cSSSIs, the adverse event profiles of daptomycin and vancomycin were similar. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels increased in 2.8% of daptomycin recipients and 1.8% of patients who received standard therapy; only one daptomycin recipient (0.2%) experienced increased CPK levels and muscle symptoms that were not associated with any comorbid factors.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence, phenotype and genotype of oral enterococci.
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence, phenotype and genotype of oral enterococci. Enterococci were detected in oral rinse samples from 11% of 100 patients receiving endodontic treatment and 1% of 100 dental students with no history of endodontic treatment (P=0.0027). All enterococcal isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecalis. Viable counts ranged from 1 x 10 to 6 x 103 colony forming units per mL of oral rinse sample. Potential virulence traits expressed by oral E. faecalis strains included production of hemolysin (n=4) and gelatinase (n=4), and response to pheromones in E. faecalis culture filtrate (n=1). Six strains produced bacteriocin. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin. There was no evidence of metal-ion resistance. One isolate produced hemolysin, gelatinase and bacteriocin, was resistant to several antibiotics, and responded to the pheromone cPD1. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis showed that oral E. faecalis exhibited widespread genetic polymorphism, with plasmids detected in seven strains.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - Microorganisms growth in endodontic citric-acid solutions with and without microbiological stabilizer.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if citric-acid solutions for endodontic use can become contaminated and if the addition of a microbiological stabilizer to the acid would modify this situation. Five types of microorganisms were inoculated in tubes containing 10% citric-acid solutions, pH 1.8 (group A1), and 10% solution, pH 1.8, combined with 0.1% sodium benzoate (group A2). The results demonstrated that solutions of group A1 were contaminated with Candida albicans in 100% of the tubes, Escherichia coli in 80%, and Enterococcus faecalis in 50%. When stabilizer was added (group A2), C. albicans grew in only 30% of tubes and all bacterial species were neutralized.
TI  - Cell density--dependent regulation: basic principles and effects on the virulence of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - PRINCIPLES: Quorum sensing (QS) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. QS-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. In the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. In the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. While Gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, Gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling. DESCRIPTIONS: Examples of QS-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis are given. In these bacteria, QS-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation. APPLICATIONS: The high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. The options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in S. aureus QS-regulation.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - Zero tolerance to shunt infections: can it be achieved?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rigid application of a technique of shunt placement aimed at the eradication of postoperative shunt infection in neurosurgical practice. METHOD: All shunt procedures were performed or closely supervised by the senior author (MSC). The essentials were the use of intravenous peri- and postoperative antimicrobials, rigid adherence to classical aseptic technique, liberal use of topical antiseptic (Betadine), and avoidance of haematomas. RESULTS: Of 176 operations, 93 were primary procedures; 33 patients underwent revisions, some multiple. Only one infection occurred, seven months postoperatively, secondary to appendicitis with peritonitis. The infecting Streptococcus faecalis appeared to ascend from the abdominal cavity. CONCLUSION: A rigidly applied protocol and strict adherence to sterile technique can reduce shunt infections to a very low level.
TI  - The role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB), and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. This demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of MB and TB. The effective dimerization constants of MB and TB were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The analysis of the effective dimerization constants for MB and TB in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for TB than for MB. Gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. There was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. These results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.
TI  - In vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin LB 11058 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococci and Streptococci.
AB  - LB 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a C-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a C-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of LB 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. LB 11058 was very active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae. LB 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. Among oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, LB 11058 MIC results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains LB 11058 MICs varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml). Coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an LB 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of S. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. LB 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml), and Bacillus spp. (MIC(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50), >64 micro g/ml) and Corynebacterium spp. (MIC(50), 32 micro g/ml). Against gram-negative pathogens, LB 11058 showed activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.25 micro g/ml), with MICs not influenced by beta-lactamase production. In conclusion, LB 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - Novel semi-synthetic nocathiacin antibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of bis- and mono-O-alkylated derivatives.
AB  - Several semi-synthetic bis- and mono-O-alkyl nocathiacin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Mono-O-alkyl N-hydroxyindole analogues 3a-l were prepared by regioselective alkylation. Bis-O-alkyl nocathiacins 4a-f were obtained by treatment with base and excess electrophile. A one-pot protection-alkylation-deprotection strategy was developed for the preparation of mono-O-alkyl hydroxypyridine analogues 5a,b. Most of the bis- and mono-O-alkyl nocathiacins maintained good in vitro activity but showed reduced in vivo efficacy when compared with the natural product. The excellent in vivo activity and improved water solubility of phosphate analogues 3m and 4g suggest their use as potential pro-drugs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei and Candida albicans. The results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Shigella dysenteriae. Bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Acquired macrolide resistance genes in pathogenic Neisseria spp. isolated between 1940 and 1987.
AB  - Seventy-six Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, isolated between 1940 and 1987, and seven Neisseria meningitidis isolates, isolated between 1963 and 1987, were screened for the presence of acquired mef(A), erm(B), erm(C), and erm(F) genes by using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR analysis, and sequencing. The mef(A), erm(B), and erm(F) genes were all identified in a 1955 N. gonorrhoeae isolate, while the erm(C) gene was identified in a 1963 N. gonorrhoeae isolate. Similarly, both the mef(A) and erm(F) genes were identified in a 1963 N. meningitidis isolate. All four acquired genes were found in later isolates of both species. The mef(A) gene from a 1975 N. gonorrhoeae isolate was sequenced and had 100% DNA and amino acid identity with the mef(A) gene from a 1990s Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate. Selected early isolates were able to transfer their acquired genes to an Enterococcus faecalis recipient, suggesting that these genes are associated with conjugative transposons. These isolates are the oldest of any species to carry the mef(A) gene and among the oldest to carry these erm genes.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and synergy studies of BAL9141, a novel pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem, tested against streptococci, enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BAL9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. BAL9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (MIC/4). BAL9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. Among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, BAL9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no BAL9141 inhibition was observed of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The activity of BAL9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. BAL9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against Enterococcus faecalis and some E. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 CFU/mL), but static effects were also noted. Drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). BAL9141 (< or = 8 mg/L) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - In vitro activities of garenoxacin (BMS-284756) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis compared to those of six other quinolones.
AB  - The activity of garenoxacin, a new quinolone, was determined in comparison with other quinolones against different strains of S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci (VGS), and Enterococcus faecalis. Strains were quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates and quinolone-resistant strains with defined mechanisms of resistance obtained from either clinical isolates or derivatives of S. pneumoniae R6. Clinical quinolone-susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae, VGS and E. faecalis showed garenoxacin MICs within a range of 0.03 microg/ml to 0.25 micro g/ml. Garenoxacin MICs increased two- to eightfold when one mutation was present in the ParC quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), fourfold when one mutation was present in the GyrA QRDR (S. pneumoniae), 8- to 64-fold when two or three mutations were associated in ParC and GyrA QRDR, and 2,048-fold when two mutations were present in both the GyrA and ParC QRDRs (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Increased active efflux had a moderate effect on garenoxacin MICs for S. pneumoniae and VGS. Against S. pneumoniae, garenoxacin behaved like moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin, being more affected by a single gyrA mutation than by a single parC mutation. Although garenoxacin was generally two- to fourfold more active than moxifloxacin against the different wild-type or mutant strains of S. pneumoniae, VGS, and E. faecalis, it was two- to fourfold less active than gemifloxacin. At four times the respective MIC for each strain, the bactericidal effect of garenoxacin, observed at 6 h for S. pneumoniae and at 24 h for S. oralis and E. faecalis, was not influenced by the presence of mutation either in the ParC or in both the ParC and GyrA QRDRs.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Prospective study of bacteremia after cardiac catheterization.
AB  - Nine hundred sixty consecutive cardiac catheterization procedures were studied prospectively for the presence of periprocedural bacteremia. Overall, among 960 procedures, only 4 were associated with clinically significant bacteremia. All 4 were related to the intravenous line and none to the cardiac procedure itself. Clinically nonsignificant bacteremias were correlated with procedural duration, multiple skin punctures, use of multiple balloons, and obesity.
TI  - New benzylidenethiazolidinediones as antibacterial agents.
AB  - A novel benzylidenethiazolidinedione has been discovered with antimicrobial activity. Here, we present the results of a structure-activity study on this compound with respect to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin compared to other quinolones against recent clinical bacterial isolates from hospitalized and community-based cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro spectrum of moxifloxacin (a C-8-methoxyquinolone) was compared to that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against 924 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. Moxifloxacin was more active than the comparator agents against Gram-positive pathogens, with potent activity against Aerococcus spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus spp., Rhodococcus equi, and Stomatococcus mucilaginous, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., all beta hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It also had good to moderate activity against Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the Enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at < or =2.0 microg/ml. Moxifloxacin was the least active of the three agents tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but had significant activity against other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli including Acinetobacter spp., Flavobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp. other than P. aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The overall broad spectrum of moxifloxacin, and its availability for both oral and parenteral administration, warrants its evaluation for the prevention and treatment of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - DNA binding ligands targeting drug-resistant bacteria: structure, activity, and pharmacology.
AB  - We describe the lead optimization and structure-activity relationship of DNA minor-groove binding ligands, a novel class of antibacterial molecules. These compounds have been shown to target A/T-rich sites within the bacterial genome and, as a result, inhibit DNA replication and RNA transcription. The optimization was focused on N-terminal aromatic heterocycles and C-terminal amines and resulted in compounds with improved in vivo tolerability and excellent in vitro antibacterial potency (MIC >/= 0.031 microg/mL) against a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Stapylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). In a first proof-of-concept study, a selected compound (35) showed in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infection with an ED(50) value of 30 mg/kg.
TI  - A model for the thermal inactivation of micro-organisms.
AB  - AIMS: To mathematically model published thermal inactivation data sets using an empirical model based on a double Arrhenius function. METHODS AND RESULTS: A mathematical model, the log R-fat, provided an excellent description of the data sets available: the thermal inactivation of Salmonella anatum at 55 degrees C, Pseudomonas viscosa at 48 degrees C and Streptococcus faecalis at 60 degrees C; Clostridium botulinum spores at various temperatures in the range of 101-121 degrees C (two data sets); thermal inactivation of Salmonella Bedford over the temperature range 50-58 degrees C, water activity range of 0.94-0.99 and a pH range of 4-7; Bacillus stearothermophilus spores from 105 to 121 degrees C and the dry heat sterilization of an indigenous mesophilic soil population over the temperature range of 120-160 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: The log R-fat model, derived from previously published chemical inactivation studies provides as good, if not better, description of thermal inactivation kinetics as other published models. The model does not invoke either of the two hypotheses of inactivation: the mechanistic or vitalistic, although it is closely linked to descriptions of the former. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The log R-fat double Arrhenius function provides the investigator with a relatively simple and easy mathematical model to apply to data of thermal inactivation. This model may allow a more accurate description of thermal food processing, especially when the safety of marginal heat processes are concerned.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of different chemical agents for the decontamination of gutta-percha cones.
AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of three disinfectants used in Dentistry for decontamination of gutta-percha cones. Sixty gutta-percha cones were contaminated with standardized pure cultures of five species of microorganisms (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Candida albicans ATCC CBS-ICB/USP 562, Bacillus subtilis spores ATCC 6633 and Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175). The cones were treated with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine aqueous solution (PVP-I; Groups 1 and 2), 5.25% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (Groups 3 and 4) and paraformaldehyde tablets (Group 5). All chemical agents were efficient for the cold sterilization of gutta-percha cones in short time periods.
TI  - Ampicillin, gentamicin and teicoplanin as antimicrobial therapy for recurrent Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser with HIV infection.
AB  - Infective endocarditis associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurs almost exclusively in intravenous (i.v.) drug users and usually involves the tricuspid valve, with an increased mortality rate among patients with a severe degree of immunosuppression. The first reported case of recurrent tricuspid endocarditis sustained by Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis in an i.v. drug addict during HIV infection is presented. Antimicrobial therapy with i.v. ampicillin, gentamicin and teicoplanin led to complete clinical and echocardiographical recovery.
TI  - Pediocin production by recombinant lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Production of the anti-listerial bacteriocin, pediocin, by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformed with the cloning vector pPC418 (Ped+, 9.1 kb) was influenced by composition of media and incubation temperature. Maximum pediocin production, tested against Listeria innocua, by electrotransformants of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was measured in tryptone/lactose/yeast extract medium after 24 h growth at 30 degrees C, while incubation at 40 degrees C was optimum for Ped+ transformants of Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis. The amount of pediocin produced by S. thermophilus in skim milk and cheese whey supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract was estimated as 51,000 units ml(-1) and 25,000 units ml(-1), respectively. Pediocin production remained essentially unchanged in reconstituted skim milk or whey media diluted up to 10-fold. The results demonstrate the capacity of recombinant strains of LAB to produce pediocin in a variety of growth media including skim milk and inexpensive cheese whey-based media, requiring minimum nutritional supplementation.
TI  - Transferable vanB2 Tn5382-containing elements in fecal streptococcal strains from veal calves.
AB  - Three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as Streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and Streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanB2 Tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. One S. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp IS256-related element inserted in vanS(B). The vanB2 Tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free S. lutetiensis strain was transferable to Enterococcus faecium BM4105-RF, Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, and its recombination-deficient derivative, UV202. The transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). All transconjugants acquired a vanB-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. Secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. These observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might be involved in the interspecies spread of vanB2 resistance determinants. Two JH2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanB-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from Puerto Rico.
AB  - The antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected Gram-positive cocci obtained from three Community-Private Hospitals (CPH) and three University-Affiliated Hospitals (UAH) were evaluated utilizing the institutions' antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (CPH) and university-affiliated hospitals (UAH). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated organism in CPH (63.3%) followed by E. faecalis (31.0%). In UAH, the most prevalent cocci were E. faecalis (51.7%) followed by S. aureus (43.9%). Enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of CPH and UAH isolates, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total Gram-positive isolates from CPH, no S. pneumoniae was reported in UAH. The antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for Staphylococcus aureus there was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in UAH, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in CPH. There was no difference in the resistance of S. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. A statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from UAH (43%) and CPH (12.7%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was observed among UAH enterococcal isolates with E. faecium showing a higher resistance than E. faecalis, no data for HLAR in CPH could be obtained. For pneumococci 46% of CPH isolates were resistant to penicillin. In summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between the Gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.
TI  - A prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). The predominant Gram-negative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the Gram-positive bacteria. No multiresistant bacteria were observed. Bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  - Intergeneric transfer of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pIP501 to Escherichia  coli and Streptomyces lividans and sequence analysis of its tra region.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the transfer (tra) region of the multiresistance broad-host-range Inc18 plasmid pIP501 was completed. The 8629-bp DNA sequence encodes 10 open reading frames (orf), 9 of them are possibly involved in pIP501 conjugative transfer. The putative pIP501 tra gene products show highest similarity to the respective ORFs of the conjugative Enterococcus faecalis plasmids pRE25 and pAMbeta1, and the Streptococcus pyogenes plasmid pSM19035, respectively. ORF7 and ORF10 encode putative homologues of type IV secretion systems involved in transport of effector molecules from pathogens to host cells and in conjugative plasmid transfer in Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. pIP501 mobilized non-selftransmissible plasmids such as pMV158 between different E. faecalis strains and from E. faecalis to Bacillus subtilis. Evidence for the very broad-host-range of pIP501 was obtained by intergeneric conjugative transfer of pIP501 to a multicellular Gram-positive (G+) bacterium, Streptomyces lividans, and to G- Escherichia coli. We proved for the first time pIP501 replication, expression of its antibiotic resistance genes as well as functionality of the pIP501 tra genes in S. lividans and E. coli.
TI  - [Surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (HAI) or community acquired infection (CAI) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: According to the previous protocol, from July 1(st) 2000 to June 30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals. Among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of the bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: The detectable rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. Among a total of 238 strains of S. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with CAI and 37 were from HAI patients, the rate of MRSA from HAI patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of MRSA from CAI patients (30.2%, 42/139) (P < 0.01). The total resistant rate of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was 26.7% (8/30), including a R% of 3.3% (1/30) and an I% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of Enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. The ratio of number of strains of E. faecalis to E. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). The rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREF) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). Neither strains of S. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus were found resistant to vancomycin. No strains of Enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. All strains of Enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The resistance patterns of Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, PRSP, and AREF are similar to the results of the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. No strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including VRSA and VISA or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE is found in this study.
TI  - Relationship between semen cultures, leukospermia, and semen analysis in men undergoing fertility evaluation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the correlation between semen cultures, semen Gram stains, leukospermia, and semen analysis parameters in asymptomatic men undergoing fertility evaluation. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTINGS: Infertility clinic at a university teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Two hundred ninety-nine asymptomatic men undergoing fertility evaluation. INTERVENTION(S): After an antibacterial skin preparation, all men gave semen specimens for culture, Gram stains, semen analysis, and assessment for leukospermia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): A comparison of the presence or absence of bacteriospermia, the specific bacterial isolate, the quantity of bacteriospermia, the presence or absence of leukospermia, and semen analysis parameters. RESULT(S): The presence or absence of bacteriospermia or leukospermia did not correlate with each other. Leukospermia did not correlate with semen parameters. Staphylococcus species was the most common isolate (25.4% of all patients) and did not correlate with semen parameters or leukospermia. Streptococcus viridans (15.4% of all patients) and Enterococcus faecalis (7.4% of all patients) were the next most common isolates and were associated with statistically significantly poorer semen quality. CONCLUSION(S): Leukospermia is a poor marker for either bacteriospermia or impaired semen quality. Staphylococcus species are commonly isolated but appear to be innocuous. Streptococcus viridans and Enterococcus faecalis are associated with poorer semen quality and may warrant treatment.
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - Role of the Enterococcus faecalis GelE protease in determination of cellular chain length, supernatant pheromone levels, and degradation of fibrin and misfolded surface proteins.
AB  - Gelatinase (GelE), a secreted Zn-metalloprotease of Enterococcus faecalis, has been implicated as a virulence factor by both epidemiological data and animal model studies. Expression of gelE is induced at a high cell density by the fsr quorum-sensing system. In the present study, GelE was shown to be responsible for the instability of a number of Asc10 (aggregation substance) mutant proteins, implying that GelE functions to clear the bacterial cell surface of misfolded proteins. Disruption of GelE production led to increased cell chain length of E. faecalis, from a typical diplococcus morphology to chains of 5 to 10 cells. This function of GelE was also exhibited when the protein was expressed in Streptococcus pyogenes. GelE-expressing E. faecalis strains were more autolytic, suggesting that GelE affects chain length through activation of an autolysin. GelE was also essential for degradation of polymerized fibrin. GelE expression reduced the titer of cCF10, the peptide pheromone that induces conjugation of pCF10, and pCF10 had increased conjugation into non-GelE-expressing strains. These new functions attributed to GelE suggest that it acts to increase the dissemination of E. faecalis in high-density environments.
TI  - Additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  - It is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. Unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to Ca(OH)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. The objective of this study was to identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. Ca(OH)2 was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. Efficacy of killing was compared for (a) Ca(OH)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (ZnO) points alone; (c) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO points; (d) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points; and (e) Ca(OH)2 points combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points. Common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. In the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. Samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. Gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by Ca(OH)2 alone. Combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. For the inactivation of the Gram-positive bacteria P. micros and S. intermedius, a combination of Ca(OH)2 and ZnO/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria faster than Ca(OH)2 alone. For E. faecalis, combining Ca(OH)2 suspension with ZnO/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. The results of this study support the use of a combination of Ca(OH)2 and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of P. micros and S. intermedius from infected root canals.
TI  - Linezolid resistance since 2001: SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. Linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. Linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. METHODS: During 2001-2002, 8 resistant strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating SENTRY institutions in the US were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus oralis. Resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated MICs (> or =8 microg/mL) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone AZD2563. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. All enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (S. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. E. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002. Resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. Clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. Longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - Construction of the mobilizable plasmid pMV158GFP, a derivative of pMV158 that carries the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein.
AB  - Plasmid pMV158 has been employed to construct cloning non-mobilizable vectors for various Gram-positive organisms. Here we report the construction of a mobilizable pMV158-based plasmid that harbors the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein under the control of a promoter inducible by maltose. The plasmid was mobilized between strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as from S. pneumoniae to Lactococcus lactis or Enterococcus faecalis at the same frequency as its parental. Transconjugant that received the GFP-tagged plasmid could be detected by their fluorescence, which was especially high in E. faecalis cells.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of L-cladinose and a C(11)-C(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. METHODS: In the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against 180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), Finegoldia magna (n = 20), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and Prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. In the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). RESULTS: In the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, N. gonorrhoeae, P. anaerobius, F. magna, B. fragilis and P. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. In the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
TI  - Indole naphthyridinones as inhibitors of bacterial enoyl-ACP reductases FabI and  FabK.
AB  - Bacterial enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. Previously we reported the development of FabI inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. Through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by X-ray crystal structure analysis, a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against FabI-containing organisms. Several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a S. aureus infection model in rats. While optimizing FabI inhibitory activity, compounds 29 and 30 were identified as having low micromolar FabK inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the FabK-containing pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. The results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-ACP reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.
TI  - Cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  - The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.
TI  - High-level gentamicin-resistant isolates of oral streptococci and Aerococcus from blood specimens.
AB  - Seventy-nine isolates of oral streptococci and Aerococcus obtained from blood specimens between December 1997 and January 2000 were tested for high-level gentamicin resistance. Three isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of > or =1024 microg/ml were selected as potential high-level gentamicin-resistant isolates. The DNA sequence of the structural gene encoding 6'-acetyltransferase-2"-phosphotransferase in the three high-level gentamicin-resistant isolates was investigated according to the method used for Enterococcus faecalis. The results of this gene analysis showed that all the DNA sequence of Aerococcus viridans no. 70, which had the highest MIC (2048 microg/ml), matched that of E. faecalis, whereas no polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were obtained in the other two isolates that were tested. The mechanism of gentamicin resistance in these two isolates is unknown.
TI  - Microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. METHODOLOGY: Sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. During nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was removed and the canals were sampled. Microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. The association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth. In most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. Of the microbial species isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% Gram-positive microorganisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. Obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was Peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (P < 0.01). Significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (P < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and Prevotella intermedia/P. nigrescens (P < 0.05); (c) sinus and Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001) or Actinomyces spp. (P < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and Streptococcus spp. or Candida spp. (both with P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly Gram-positive microbial species. Facultative anaerobes, especially E. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.
TI  - Evaluation of root canal microorganisms isolated from teeth with endodontic failure and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Studies of the microbiota from the canals of teeth with failure of endodontic therapy have revealed that it differs markedly from that of untreated necrotic dental pulps. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of 30 root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the most prevalent species. Microbial samples, isolation and speciation were done using advanced microbiologic techniques for anaerobic species. A total of 55 bacterial species were isolated, 80% were gram-positives and 58% facultative anaerobic microorganisms. The bacterial genera most frequently recovered were Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Actinomyces. Antibiotic sensitivity of Enterococcus faecalis and Peptostreptococcus spp. was accomplished with the E-test system. All species studied were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate. However, 20% of the E.faecalis strains were resistant to erythromycin and 60% to azithromycin. It was concluded that microbial flora in canals after endodontic failure comprised predominantly facultative anaerobes and gram-positive species. E.faecalis was the species most frequently isolated and showed erythromycin and azithromycin resistance among the isolates.
TI  - Meconium enhances the growth of perinatal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effects of meconium on growth of bacterial pathogens, which are common causes of intra-amniotic infection and neonatal sepsis. METHODS: Meconium collected from 9 healthy neonates was suspended as a 20% solution using sterile saline. In experiment 1, separate test tubes of meconium solution and sterile saline (the control) were individually inoculated with 10(6) colony-forming units of a single species of the following test pathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. After incubation at 37 degree C for 24 hours, 1 L each of the bacterial-meconium and bacterial-saline solutions was inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar. After 24 hours of incubation, the number of developing colonies was counted. In experiment 2, equal volumes of meconium and saline solutions were inoculated with 10(5) colony-forming units of either E. coli or Group B Streptococcus. At intervals of 6, 9, and 24 hours post-incubation, 1 L each of the bacterial-meconium and bacterial-saline solutions was inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar plates, and colonies were counted after overnight incubation. RESULTS: In the first experiment, 24 hours of incubation resulted in bacterial amplification in the meconium solution from an initial inoculum of 10(6) colony-forming units/mL to 10(9) colony-forming units/mL. In contrast, the same inoculation of saline solution (control) showed no increase in colony counts over the same time interval. For E. coli and Group B Streptococcus in experiment 2, growth enhancement in meconium was seen as early as 6 hours, as colony counts of a test species increased from 105 colony-forming units/mL to 10(9)-10(10) colony-forming units/mL. CONCLUSION: Enhanced growth of perinatal pathogens in meconium was constantly observed, and can occur as early as 6 hours after bacterial interaction of meconium.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Molecular diagnosis of infective endocarditis by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of DNA from valve tissue.
AB  - We used broad-range eubacterial PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing to identify microbial pathogens in heart valve material from 29 patients with histologically confirmed infective endocarditis and 23 patients free of infective endocarditis. Microorganisms cultured by conventional techniques matched those identified by PCR in 21 cases. PCR alone identified the causative agent in three cases (Streptococcus bovis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Coxiella burnetii), allowing better patient management. PCR corrected the initial bacteriological diagnosis in three cases (Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mutans, and Bartonella henselae). Among the 29 cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, PCR findings were positive in 27 cases and were consistent with the bacterial morphology seen at Gram staining (26 cases) or with the results obtained by immunohistologic analysis with an anti-C. burnetii monoclonal antibody (one case). In two other cases of histologically confirmed infective endocarditis, PCR remained negative in a blood culture-negative case for which no bacteria were seen at histological analysis and in one case with visualization of cocci and blood cultures positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Ten clinical diagnoses of possible infective endocarditis were ruled out by histopathological analysis of the valves and subsequently by PCR. PCR was negative in 13 of the 14 patients in whom infective endocarditis was rejected on clinical grounds; the other patient was found to have Coxiella burnetii infective endocarditis on the basis of PCR and histopathological analysis and was subsequently included in the group of 29 definite cases. In total, PCR contributed to the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis in 6 of 29 (20%) cases.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control parameters for AZD2563, a novel long-acting oxazolidinone.
AB  - AZD2563 is a new, long-acting oxazolidinone that possesses potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive organisms. This report summarizes the results of broth microdilution MIC and disk diffusion quality control (QC) investigations for AZD2563. All tests or methods (M2-A7 and M7-A5) and QC study designs (M23-A2) were those published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. QC strains tested against AZD2563 included: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619. In the eight-center QC trial, 320 and 480 results were generated for MIC and disk diffusion tests, respectively. The selected 7-mm ranges for the two disk diffusion QC organisms contained > or = 98.5% of reported results. Proposed 3 or 4 log(2) dilution MIC ranges contained all reported participant results. AZD2563 disk diffusion zone diameters were generally 2-3 mm smaller than the corresponding linezolid zone diameters. In conclusion, QC ranges for AZD2563 MIC and disk diffusion methods were established and appear acceptable in preparation for the clinical trials use.
TI  - Prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the Puerto Rico Medical Center.
AB  - The Gram-positive cocci (GPC), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. The prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. Few prospective studies have been performed in Puerto Rico (PR) concerning the GPC antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of GPC clinical isolates from PR to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (LZ), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and gemifloxacin (GM). The in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and Etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the Puerto Rico Medical Center Bacteriology Laboratory. The distribution of GPC collected was as follows: 213 S. aureus isolates, 162 E. faecalis, 16 E. faecium and 38 S. pneumoniae. The results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in S. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (VAN), LZ and Q/D; 93% to GM; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in S. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to LN and GM; 87% to Q/D; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in E. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to LZ; 79% to GM; 78.6% to VAN; and 0% to Q/D. Sixty eight and 66% of the E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in E. faecium, 100% were susceptible to LZ; 94% to Q/D; 69% to GM; 37.5% to VAN and 20% to ampicillin. In E. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of E. faecium and faecalis showed VanA phenotypic resistance, respectively. These results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in GPC, including 38% methicillin resistance in S. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to VAN. The new agents, LZ, Q/D and GM, proved to be effective against both, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. For E. faecium, both, LZ and Q/D were active, while for E. faecalis, only LZ showed consistent activity.
TI  - Multicentre evaluation of the in vitro activity of linezolid in the Western Pacific.
AB  - Multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is common in staphylococci and pneumococci isolates in the Western Pacific region. The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was evaluated against a spectrum of Gram-positive species collected in the region. Eighteen laboratories from six countries in the Western Pacific examined the linezolid susceptibility of 2143 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Enterococcus spp. using broth microdilution or disc diffusion methodology. For Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 351) and other streptococci (n = 83), Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips were used. Results were compared with other common and important antimicrobials. Linezolid-resistant strains were not detected among streptococci or staphylococci, including a significant proportion of S. aureus strains that were multiresistant. Almost all enterococci, including 14 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were linezolid susceptible. A small proportion of enterococci (0.8%) were intermediate to linezolid, and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis had a zone diameter of 20 mm (resistant). The linezolid MIC ranges (MIC(90)) of those strains tested by broth microdilution or Etest were: 1-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for S. aureus, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for CoNS, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for Enterococcus spp., 0.12-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for S. pneumoniae and 0.25-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for Streptococcus spp. There was no difference in linezolid susceptibility between countries or between multiresistant and susceptible strains of each species monitored.
TI  - Etiology of acute otitis media in childhood and evaluation of two different protocols of antibiotic therapy: 10 days cefaclor vs. 3 days azitromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood infection that is frequently treated by antibiotics. There are no prospective and comprehensive trials evaluating childhood AOM for etiologic pathogens and resistance pattern in Turkey. The aims of the study were to determine the bacterial etiologies and resistance patterns, and identify the efficacy and the relapse rates of 3 days of azitromycin and 10 days of cefaclor therapy in AOM. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, single-blind, open study was carried out in 78 cases of AOM. Mean age was 30.7+/-27 months. Tympanocentesis and aspiration of middle ear fluid (MEF) were used to obtain purulent material from the middle ear. Group 1 consisted of the cases (n=41) on azitromycin therapy and Group 2 (n=37) on cefaclor. Dosage of azitromycin was 10 mg/kg per day for 3 days and cefaclor 40 mg/kg per day for 10 days. The patients were evaluated on days 3-5 (second visit), day 10 (third visit), and day 30 (fourth visit) during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 50 species were isolated from 44 of 78 cases from which materials were obtained (44/78; 56.4%). Most frequently isolated microorganism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=18; 36%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (n=11; 22%), S. aureus (n=9; 18%), Moraxella catarrhalis (n=4; 8%), and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS, n=4; 8%). Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from three cases and H. parainfluenzae from one. Penicillin and amoxicillin resistances of bacteria were found to be 40 and 36%, respectively. The frequency of penicillin and amoxicillin resistance in </=24-month age group was 59 and 66.6%, respectively. The patients did not demonstrate significant differences in terms of cure rate on the third to fifth day (Group 1: 32.5%; Group 2: 36.4%), 10th day (Group 1: 76.9%; Group 2: 84.8%), and on 30th day (Group 1: 91.3%; Group 2: 81.8%). There were no significant differences with respect to side effects, relapse, and re-infection rate between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In more than half of the AOM cases, bacteria were isolated from MEF and most frequently isolated organisms were S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. Three-day azitromycin therapy was as effective as 10-day cefaclor therapy.
TI  - MC21-A, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We previously reported a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the present study, we purified an anti-MRSA substance (MC21-A) from the methanol extract of the cells of P. phenolica O-BC30(T) and analyzed its chemical structure. MC21-A was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. Its anti-MRSA activity against 10 clinical isolates of MRSA was comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A MICs, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin MICs, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). This substance was also high active against Enterococcus serolicida, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis but was less active against Streptococcus spp. A time-kill study also demonstrated that MC21-A was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MC21-A against a clinical MRSA isolate, strain E 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A PAEs, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin PAEs, 0.84 to 1.43 h). However, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse MRSA cells. This substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. A SYTOX Green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of MRSA as its mode of action. When its activities against a hypersensitive Escherichia coli mutant (KO 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, MC21-A exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. Furthermore, MC21-A was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and Vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. These results suggest that MC21-A might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-MRSA substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Normal conjunctival flora in the North American opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
AB  - We documented the normal conjunctival bacterial flora from 17 opossums (Didelphis virginiana) and 10 raccoons (Procyon lotor) trapped in Manhattan, Kansas (USA) from November 1999 to January 2000. Both raccoons and opossums were free of apparent ocular disease. The inferior conjunctival sacs of each animal were swabbed for aerobic bacterial and Mycoplasma culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia detection. All conjunctival samples were positive for one or more species of aerobic bacteria. The most common isolate from opossums was Staphylococcus spp. Other isolates included Streptococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. The most common isolates in raccoons was Bacillus spp. Other isolates included Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., non-hemolytic Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Mycoplasma culture was negative in samples from opossums and raccoons. Evidence of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia presence was detected by PCR.
TI  - Multicentre assessment of linezolid antimicrobial activity and spectrum in Europe: report from the Zyvox antimicrobial potency study (ZAPS-Europe).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro spectrum and activity of linezolid, a recent  oxazolidinone, according to well-controlled surveillance data from 42 medical centers in 13 countries throughout Europe. METHODS: Participants tested the susceptibility of 125 clinical strains of enterococcal and staphylococcal species against 13 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays or the standardized disk diffusion method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Streptococcal species (n = 25 at each center) were tested against six drugs using E test (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Quality assurance testing was conducted using NCCLS-recommended strains and verification of resistance to linezolid and other selected agents was performed by retesting strains at the regional (Europe) and international (USA) monitor sites. RESULTS: A total of 5598 strains from throughout Europe (91% compliance) were tested. Vancomycin resistance was reported in only 0.6 and 3.0% of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively. Penicillin resistance occurred in 25.1% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; 4.9% at the high-level (> or =2 mg/L). The MIC90 for linezolid was 1 mg/L for streptococci and 2 mg/L for enterococci and staphylococci. Using the US FDA- and EUCAST-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), > or =8 mg/L]. The distribution of linezolid MIC values was unimodal and varied between 0.25 and 1 mg/L for streptococci (>90% of isolates), and between 1 and 2 mg/L for staphylococci (>90%) and enterococci (>95%). There were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin-, oxacillin-, or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains when compared to susceptible organism populations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the North American component of this study, there was substantially less vancomycin resistance among E. faecium isolates (Europe 3.0% vs. North America 63.4%). While the occurrence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in Europe and North America was similar (25.1% vs. 29.7%), the recovery of high-level penicillin-resistant strains was nearly three-fold higher in North America (4.9% vs. 13.2%). Only linezolid was universally active against all the tested Gram-positive isolates at </=4 mg/L.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of hypertrophied tonsils in children with secretory otitis media].
AB  - The potentially pathogenic bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major bacterial flora of hypertrophied tonsils. In children suffering from otitis media with inflammatory effusion an unfortunate decreased physiological flora of Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria is observed.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of RWJ-54428, a new cephalosporin with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with activity against resistant gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo efficacy of RWJ-54428 was evaluated against gram-positive bacteria in four mouse models of infection. RWJ-54428 was effective in vivo against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus in a mouse model of sepsis, with 50% effective doses being similar to those of vancomycin. In a single-dose neutropenic mouse thigh model of infection, RWJ-54428 at 30 mg/kg of body weight showed activity similar to that of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg against a strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. RWJ-54428 also showed a prolonged in vivo postantibiotic effect in this model. In a mouse model of pneumonia due to a penicillin-susceptible strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, RWJ-54428 displayed efficacy and potency superior to those of penicillin G and cefotaxime. In a mouse model of pyelonephritis due to Enterococcus faecalis, RWJ-54428 had bactericidal effects similar to those of vancomycin and ampicillin, but at two- to threefold lower total daily doses. These studies show that RWJ-54428 is active in experimental mouse models of infection against gram-positive organisms, including strains resistant to earlier cephalosporins and penicillin G.
TI  - Bacteriophage isolation from human saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To detect bacteriophages for Gram-positive oral pathogens in human saliva.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples from 31 donors were screened for the presence of bacteriophages for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacteriophages for Enterococcus faecalis were found in seven samples. Enterococcus faecalis phages were still present in saliva re-collected from one donor one month, and one year after initial saliva collection. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and stability of the Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages in human saliva suggests a possible role of these bacteriophages in the oral ecosystem. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Phage therapy as a way to control oral bacteria might be considered.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in Korea.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In Korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. In this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four Korean university hospitals during 1999-2000. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Gemifloxacin had the lowest MICs for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, while those for other Gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/L. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against Gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in Korea.
TI  - Development of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bacterial identification in diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial PCR in infective endocarditis (IE) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. METHODS: Thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with IE (diagnosed according to Duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. Two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. DNA was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for 16S rRNA were tested, to determine the most specific pair. Amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under UV light. RESULTS: Positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with IE. A typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. The highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (F/R) primers, as the relevant amplified PCR product was present in all blood samples with IE, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. CONCLUSION: Broad-range PCR in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific PCR. However, under controlled conditions, broad-range PCR may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.
TI  - High incidence of oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia in human semen infected with the aerobic bacterium Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Bacterial culture of semen samples from 100 male partners in infertile couples revealed the presence of aerobic bacteria in 49 cases. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus) was isolated from 53%, micrococci species from 20% and alpha-haemolytic streptococci from 16% of the infected samples. The incidence of oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in men whose semen samples contained S. faecalis than those whose semen samples contained micrococci or alpha-haemolytic streptococci or those that did not contain bacteria. The mean sperm concentration, as well as the mean percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, was significantly (P < 0.03) lower in semen infected with S. faecalis compared with that containing micrococci or alpha-haemolytic streptococci and the uninfected samples. There is a high incidence of semen infection with S. faecalis, and it is associated with compromised semen quality in terms of sperm concentration and morphology. The presence of micrococci or alpha-haemolytic streptococci does not appear to have any detrimental effect on sperm quality.
TI  - An assessment of microbial coronal leakage of temporary filling materials in endodontically treated teeth.
AB  - This in vitro study evaluated the microbial leakage of Cavit, IRM, and Dyract when used as temporary filling materials after root canal treatment. The degree of coronal leakage was assessed by using a microbiological marker consisting of Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. For each of the two organisms, a set of 15 maxillary premolars were prepared chemomechanically and obturated with thermoplasticized gutta-percha. A 3.5-mm thick layer of one of the three temporary filling materials was inserted in the access cavities of the teeth from each group (each group was compromised of five teeth). The control teeth (four positive and four negative) lacked any filling material over the gutta-percha, whereas the orifice and the apical foramen of the negative control were completely sealed with nail polish. Each tooth was placed in a well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and embedded in trypticase soy broth and 0.5% Bactoagar. An organism suspension was inoculated in the access cavity, and microbial penetration was detected as an increase in turbidity of the broth. At the end of 30 days, the results showed that all positive control teeth leaked within 1 week, whereas those that served as negative control remained uncontaminated throughout the test period. With both organisms, IRM started to leak after 10 days, whereas Cavit and Dyract leaked after 2 weeks.
TI  - Microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. Stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. The test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. Enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic Porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedial intermedia. Ca(OH)2 + CMCP + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. We conclude that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, an inhibitor of human topoisomerase I.
AB  - The naturally occurring (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid was synthesized stereochemically pure in six steps starting with commercially available 1,5-hexadiyne. The title compound was antimicrobial against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 80 microM) and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC 200 microM), but inactive against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid completely inhibits human topoisomerase I at a concentration of 800 microM, while 5,9-hexadecadiynoic acid and hexadecanoic acid do not inhibit topoisomerase I (>1000 microM). This comparison reveals that the cis double bond geometry in the title compound is required for topoisomerase I inhibition. Moreover, these results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of (5Z,9Z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid against either S. aureus or S. faecalis could be a result, at least in part, of the inhibitory activity of the acid against topoisomerases.
TI  - Innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. Mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus mitis, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Veillonella parvula, and Neisseria sicca. The levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking CD14, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and TLR-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. The levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. Gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of IL-10 were similar in newborns and adults. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in cord cells. L. plantarum bound or signaled through CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4, whereas E. coli acted mainly through CD14 and TLR-4. These results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - A study on the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from the root canal infections in  anterior non-vital teeth with special reference to Bacteroides species.
AB  
TI  - Influence of dry period bacterial intramammary infection on clinical mastitis in  dairy cows.
AB  - Milk samples were taken from 1920 quarters (480 cows, six herds) on four occasions to examine the relationship between quarter level intramammary infection (IMI) during the dry period and clinical mastitis in the next lactation. All quarters were sampled at drying off and within 1 wk of calving, and two quarters from each cow were sampled both 0 to 7 and 8 to 14 d before calving. Milk samples were collected from all cases of clinical mastitis during the following lactation. Logistic regression models were developed to investigate the associations between IMI present during the sampling period and clinical mastitis. The probability of a quarter succumbing to clinical mastitis increased when Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Enterobacter spp. were cultured at drying off and when Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococcus, Serratia spp., or Streptococcus faecalis were cultured in two out of three late dry and post-calving samples. Quarters from which Corynebacterium spp. were isolated at drying off were at an increased risk of clinical mastitis, whereas the presence of Corynebacterium spp. in the late dry and post-calving samples was associated with a reduction in the risk of clinical mastitis. The risk of mastitis for specific pathogens increased if the same species of bacteria that had caused mastitis was isolated at least twice in the late dry and post-calving samples. Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicated that clinical mastitis associated with dry period infections was more likely to occur earlier in lactation than clinical mastitis not associated with dry period infections. There was evidence of quarter susceptibility to IMI or the possibility that infection with one organism led to clinical mastitis with another.
TI  - Functional analysis of TraA, the sex pheromone receptor encoded by pPD1, in a promoter region essential for the mating response in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Conjugative transfer of a bacteriocin plasmid, pPD1, of Enterococcus faecalis is  induced in response to a peptide sex pheromone, cPD1, secreted from plasmid-free recipient cells. cPD1 is taken up by a pPD1 donor cell and binds to an intracellular receptor, TraA. Once a recipient cell acquires pPD1, it starts to produce an inhibitor of cPD1, termed iPD1, which functions as a TraA antagonist and blocks self-induction in donor cells. In this study, we discuss how TraA transduces the signal of cPD1 to the mating response. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that TraA is bound to a traA-ipd intergenic region, which is essential for cPD1 response. DNase I footprinting analysis suggested the presence of one strong (tab1) and two weak (tab2 and tab3) TraA-binding sites in the intergenic region. Primer extension analysis implied that the transcriptional initiation sites of traA and ipd were located in the intergenic region. Northern analysis showed that cPD1 upregulated and downregulated transcription of ipd and traA, respectively. The circular permutation assay showed that TraA bent a DNA fragment corresponding to the tab1 region, and its angle was changed in the presence of cPD1 or iPD1. From these data, we propose a model that TraA changes the conformation of the tab1 region in response to cPD1 and upregulates the transcription of ipd, which may lead to expression of genes required for the mating response.
TI  - The ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  - The 34,734-bp element ICESt1 from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. ICESt1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. Six proteins of the putative conjugative system of ICESt1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis. A comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low G+C bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, E. faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. These exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. Therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. We propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "Integrative and Conjugative Elements" (ICEs), irrespective of the integration specificity.
TI  - Proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide LL-37.
AB  - Effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. Here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the antibacterial peptide LL-37. Analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by P. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at Asn-Leu and Asp-Phe, followed by two breaks at Arg-Ile, thus inactivating the peptide. Proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded LL-37 as determined by SDS-PAGE. Ex vivo, P. aeruginosa elastase induced LL-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. The degradation was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitors GM6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited P. aeruginosa elastase, P. mirabilis proteinase, and E. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor E64 (which inhibited S. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). Additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [DeltaUA(2S)-GalNAc(4,6S)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of LL-37. The results indicate that proteolytic degradation of LL-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.
TI  - Bacterial adhesins--their role in tubule invasion and endodontic disease.
AB  - Bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules is critical to the progression of dental caries and the development of pulp and periapical disease, and may also influence the progression of periodontal disease. However, little is known about the host or bacterial mechanisms involved in tubule invasion. Recent work has demonstrated that bacterial interactions with dentine, and salivary and tissue molecules influence invasion. Salivary molecules such as mucin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) co-aggregate with bacterial cells, which inhibits dentine invasion, while deposition of dentinal tubule fluid molecules e.g. albumin, IgG, or fibrinogen within dentinal tubules also inhibits invasion. Dentine invasion by streptococci has been shown to be associated with a bacterial growth response and adhesion to unmineralized collagen, which are mediated by streptococcal cell-surface antigen I/II polypeptides. These adhesins possess diverse binding properties including binding to salivary glycoprotein, other bacteria, and to collagen. Additionally, some antigen I/II polypeptides facilitate species-specific co-invasion between streptococci and obligate anaerobes that lack the ability to invade by themselves. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in bacterial invasion of dentine should allow development of new control strategies.
TI  - Patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in Jimma Hospital.
AB  - Gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients. The pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between January 1997 and June 2000 in Jimma Hospital. Of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. The following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), CoNS, 36 (31.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) Streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and Streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. The in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin G, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. The majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. The resistance patterns of S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7% and 100% respectively. Penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects (< 60%) on both S. aureus and CoNS. Multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. All isolates of S. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. This entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  mecA, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. In relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsB, the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been recently described. In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for Staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vanA is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.
TI  - Discovery of a novel and potent class of FabI-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  - Bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabI) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. High-throughput screening of the Staphylococcus aureus FabI enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Iterative medicinal chemistry and X-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(E)-N-methyl-N-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the FabI inhibition assay. Compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an S. aureus infection model in rats. Biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of FabI. Compound 4 also exhibits weak FabK inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, which depend on FabK and both FabK and FabI, respectively, for their enoyl-ACP reductase function. These results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for the treatment of S. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Novel antibiotics for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - The natural dipeptide antibiotic TAN 1057 A,B displays excellent antibacterial activity against staphylococci including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, the in vitro activity against additional Gram-positive strains, in particular pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis, proved to be considerably lower. We report the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new derivatives of this natural product that displayed increased antibacterial potency against staphylococci and were also active against pneumococci. In particular, the analogues bearing modified beta-homoarginine side chains with methylated guanidine moieties were shown to be significantly more potent than the natural product TAN 1057 A,B.
TI  - Cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. Continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. Seven potential probiotics were found: Lactobacillus fermentum strains F53 and KC5b, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 43143, Enterococcus durans DSM 20633, Enterococcus gallinarum, and Enterococcus faecalis. A comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. The degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. The human isolate L. fermentum KC5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at pH 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. This strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DW286, a new fluoronaphthyridone antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of DW286, a novel fluoronaphthyridone with potent antibacterial activity, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and trovafloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis, the in vitro activity of DW286 was stronger than that of any other reference antibiotic. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of DW286 was similar to those of trovafloxacin and gemifloxacin but was weaker than that of ciprofloxacin. In a mouse systemic infection caused by three S. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and quinolone-resistant S. aureus (QRSA), DW286 demonstrated the most potent activity, as found in vitro. Specially, DW286 is >or=8-fold more active against QRSA than the other fluoroquinolones. And the 50% protective doses for DW286 were correspondent with the in vitro activities.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - In vitro activity of AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, against European Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - AZD2563 is a new oxazolidinone that has targeted activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro activity of AZD2563 and nine comparators against 1543 European enterococcal, staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates was determined. The compound is a potent oxazolidinone, with no isolate tested displaying an MIC > 4 mg/L and 94.4% having an MIC < or =2 mg/L. Compared with linezolid, the distribution of MICs for all species of bacteria tested, with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, was shifted by one or two dilution steps to lower values for AZD2563. Thus, this oxazolidinone is a promising new antibiotic for the treatment of infections with Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the erm(A) gene from erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolide-susceptible S. pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria innocua.
AB  - In mating experiments, the erythromycin resistance methylase gene erm(A) was successfully transferred from erm(A)-positive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolide-susceptible recipients of S. pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria innocua. Compared with the SmaI macrorestriction pattern of the S. pyogenes recipient, the patterns of S. pyogenes transconjugants shared the lack of a fragment and the appearance of a new, larger fragment. This is the first experimental evidence that the erm(A) gene can be transferred from erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes to macrolide-susceptible S. pyogenes as well as to other Gram-positive recipients.
TI  - The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in PmpA, the PrsA-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The prsA-like gene from Lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to PrsA, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in Bacillus subtilis, was characterized. This gene, annotated pmpA, encodes a lipoprotein of 309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. A slight increase in the expression of the PrsA-like protein (PLP) in L. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the Staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. This shows that PmpA either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease HtrA. Unlike the case for B. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding PmpA reduced only slightly the growth rate of L. lactis in standard conditions. However, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. Like PrsA of B. subtilis and PrtM of L. lactis, the L. lactis PmpA protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. These proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases) for which parvulin is the prototype. Almost all PLP from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the PPIase signature. An exception to this situation was found only in Streptococcaceae, the family to which L. lactis belongs. PLP from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of L. lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus mutans do not. However, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of PLP is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. The activity associated with the expression of PmpA in L. lactis and these genomic data show that either the PPIase motif is not necessary for PPIase activity or, more likely, PmpA foldase activity does not necessarily require PPIase activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of a novel oxazolidinone, AZD2563, against randomly selected and multiresistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, was assessed against 595 Gram-positive cocci, comprising recent surveillance isolates and a collection of resistant (including multiresistant), epidemiologically diverse isolates. The MICs of AZD2563 for staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci had narrow ranges, 0.25-2 mg/L, with modal MICs of 1 mg/L for staphylococci and pneumococci, and 1-2 mg/L for enterococci. AZD2563 was equally active against the surveillance isolates and those that had been selected for their multiresistance to other agents. The MICs of AZD2563 were either the same as those of linezolid or two-fold lower.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - Source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  - Enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. Their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the intestines of insects and birds. The source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is unknown. In the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type 646 Enterococcus strains which were isolated from a Cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. Nine different PFGE patterns, three of Enterococcus casseliflavus, five of Enterococcus faecalis, and one of Enterococcus durans, were found. The same three clones, one of E. faecalis and two of E. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. The two E. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. It is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. Cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk or the cheese.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of calcium hydroxide points.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antibacterial effect of calcium hydroxide points by using a broth dilution test. Extracts of calcium hydroxide points and a calcium hydroxide paste (Calasept) were tested by using 2 facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 27352) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). Saline solution was used as a control. Each tested agent was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, 2 days, and 5 days. Results showed that Calasept paste was effective in killing the tested bacteria, whereas calcium hydroxide points and saline showed bacterial survival in all experimental periods. It was concluded that calcium hydroxide points extract is not an effective antimicrobial agent against the tested bacteria.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - [Comparison of the homologous SfeI and LlaBI restriction-modification systems].
AB  - A fragment containing the SfeI restriction-modification system (RMS) operon was cloned from a Streptococcus faecalis SE72 plasmid. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed its high (99.2%) homology to the operon for Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W56 LlaBI RMS recognizing the same site, 5'-CTRYAG-3'. A substantial difference was that SfeI RMS operon had an additional 198-bp fragment and a larger gene for the putative control protein. No homology was observed between operon-flanking sequences of the two closely related species, suggesting horizontal transfer of the operon.
TI  - Role of the Streptococcus gordonii SspB protein in the development of Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. P. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal Streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of P. gingivalis biofilms. Binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the P. gingivalis major fimbrial FimA protein and the species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial Mfa1 protein with the streptococcal SspB protein. This study examined the contribution of the Mfa1-SspB interaction to P. gingivalis biofilm formation. P. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of S. gordonii DL1 but not on Streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of SspB. An insertional inactivation of the mfa1 gene in P. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in S. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. Furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that P. gingivalis biofilms formed on Enterococcus faecalis strains expressing SspB or translational fusions of SspB with SpaP (the non-adherent SspB homologue in S. mutans) containing the P. gingivalis adherence domain (SspB adherence region, BAR) of SspB. In contrast, an isogenic Ssp null mutant of S. gordonii DL1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to P. gingivalis FimA at levels similar to wild-type S. gordonii DL1. Finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in BAR resulted in SspB polypeptides that did not promote the development of P. gingivalis biofilms. These results suggest that the induction of P. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional SspB-minor fimbriae interactions.
TI  - A multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in North America.
AB  - Overall, 141 centers in North America enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. Each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using Etests (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Quality control testing was conducted using recommended strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was performed by a regional monitor. Of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the United States (US; n = 132) and Canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. Oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) isolates, respectively. Vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (MIC, > or =2 microg/ml). The MIC(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and CoNS isolates, and 4 microg/ml for S. aureus. Using the US FDA-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., MIC > or =8 microg/ml). The occurrence of linezolid MICs was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). Susceptibility to linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. Only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested Gram-positive specimens. The unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key Gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.
TI  - Actinomyces species, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Actinomyces species,  streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. Samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples. All root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, Actinomyces species in 9.4%, and E. faecalis in 7.5%. The most prevalent species were members of the Streptococcus anginosus group. With regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most prevalent species were S. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), E. faecalis (11.5%), and S. anginosus (7.7%). S. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). The other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were A. gerencseriae (14.8%), S. gordonii (11.1%), S. intermedius (11.1%), A. israelii (7.4%), S. anginosus (7.4%), and S. sanguis (7.4%). S. constellatus was the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, RWJ-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against Gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. We compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, RWJ-54428 (MC-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 Staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 Enterococcus faecalis, 20 Enterococcus faecium, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. The MIC(90) of RWJ-54,428 was < or = 2 mg/L for all groups of bacteria tested except E. faecium. The activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/L).
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cAM373 activity in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The sex pheromone cAM373 of Enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cAM373 of Staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the C-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. The deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. The chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated camE (encoding cAM373) and camS (encoding staph-cAM373). Truncated and full-length clones of camE were generated in Escherichia coli, in which cAM373 activity was expressed. In E. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of camE had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. Establishment of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cAM373 activity to 3% of normal levels. The camS determinant has homologues in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cAM373 closely. The particular significance of staph-cAM373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  - From January 1999 to May 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. They concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. These patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). Seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. During 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. In six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). Most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten Streptococcus mitis, five S. oralis, two S. sanguis, three S. pneumoniae). A single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The enterococci were one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium. Ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L of penicillin G, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = MIC < 32 mg/L), and a strain was resistant (MIC = 32 mg/L). Eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. For three strains, the MICs of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/L and 8-32 mg/L, respectively) were higher. Levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. All species were susceptible to glycopeptides. Three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. Their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. This results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - [Four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene with diabetes mellitus].
AB  - We report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. All cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. Case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Citrobacter freundii and Staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. Case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. Bacteroides bivius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. Case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. Bacteroides fragiris, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. Case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. In all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. Prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. These four patients, however, all survived. Once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). Earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. Because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in the workplace where accidents often happen.
TI  - In vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  - Fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. The trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. Carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both Gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. All Gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/L of carboxyfullerene, whereas Gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/L carboxyfullerene. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for Gram-positive species, particularly for Streptococcus pyogenes A-20, which was killed rapidly. Intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by TEM and anti-carboxyfullerene binding assay. Damage to the cell membrane in Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. These findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.
TI  - Shima drinking water--a bacteriological analysis.
AB  - 300 water samples, 60 from piped supply and 240 from 20 natural sources were analyzed bacteriologically for four important bacterial indicators every month over a period of one year. The MPN of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis were detected by multiple tube method and Clostridium perfringens was isolated using litmus milk medium. From piped water supply, only one sample was found unfit for human consumption. The plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C varied from 0.5 x 10(3) to 15 x 10(3) per ml. of water. From natural sources, MPN indices for coliforms, Esch. coli and S. faecalis varied from 3 to > 1800, 0 to > 1800 and 0 to 540 per 100 ml. of water respectively. About 1/3rd of samples showed presence of Cl. perfringens. The plate count varied from 1.0 x 10(3) to > 150 x 10(3) per ml. of water. Salmonella typhi was isolated in 1.25% samples by membrane filtration technique. The water from all the natural sources was unfit for human consumption whereas piped water supply was of good quality in general.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a novel cephalosporin, BMS-247243, against organisms other than staphylococci.
AB  - BMS-247243, a novel cephalosporin inhibitory for methicillin-resistant staphylococci, primarily has activity against gram-positive bacteria. The activities of BMS-247243, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were similar. BMS-247243 inhibits Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. BMS-247243 also inhibits many inherently vancomycin-resistant species (Leuconstoc, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus) and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Involvement of PhoP-PhoS homologs in Enterococcus faecalis virulence.
AB  - Eleven PhoP-PhoS homolog pairs were identified by searching the Enterococcus faecalis V583 genome sequence database at The Institute for Genomic Research with the Bacillus subtilis PhoP-PhoS sequences. Each pair appears to be a potential two-component system composed of a response regulator and a sensor kinase. Seven of the homologs were disrupted in E. faecalis strain OG1RF. TX10293, a mutant disrupted in one of these genes (etaR, the first gene of the gene pair designated etaRS), showed delayed killing and a higher 50% lethal dose in a mouse peritonitis model. The predicted EtaR protein sequence showed greatest similarity to LisR of Listeria monocytogenes (77%) and CsrR of Streptococcus pyogenes (70%); EtaS is 53% similar to LisK and 54% similar to CsrS. When grown in vitro, the TX10293 mutant was more sensitive to low pH (pH 3.4) and more resistant to high temperature (55 degrees C) than wild-type OG1RF. In conclusion, many potential two-component systems are identified for E. faecalis, one of which, EtaRS, was shown to be involved in stress response and virulence.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of seven different types of Asian chewing sticks.
AB  - There are various plants, which are used as chewing sticks in different parts of  the world. Several studies have been reported on the antimicrobial effects of chewing sticks on oral bacteria. The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effect of aqueous extract of seven different types of chewing sticks found in Pakistan and other Asian countries. The ditch plate method was used to test the antimicrobial activity of seven Asian chewing sticks. It was found that at there was antimicrobial effect on Streptococcus fecalis at 50% concentration of Kikar (Acacia arabica) from Pakistan and Arak (Salvadora persica) from Saudi Arabia. The inhibition zones up to 2 mm were found in those two chewing stick extracts. It is recommended that the chewing sticks will be a great help in developing countries with financial constraints and limited oral health care facilities for their populations.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - Grepafloxacin: pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration studies of grepafloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, show that it has useful properties for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Grepafloxacin has a volume of distribution that is larger than those of many of the other fluoroquinolones and is concentrated in alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa and epithelial lining fluid to a greater extent than are certain other fluoroquinolones. Grepafloxacin concentrations achieved in plasma after a 400-mg oral dose are well in excess of those required to inhibit the respiratory pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is also covered for most of the dosing interval, but at normal dose levels grepafloxacin might not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis. The maximum plasma concentrations and area under the concentration---time curve achieved with grepafloxacin suggest that it will be effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones are among their most useful properties. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate whether the differences between grepafloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones are of therapeutic significance.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - The effect of tissue molecules on bacterial invasion of dentine.
AB  - Bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules is a critical step in the pathogenesis of  dental caries and pulp and periapical disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect some molecules commonly found in saliva and dentinal tubule fluid may have on the bacterial invasion of dentine. The results showed that invasion of Streptococcus gordonii or Enterococcus faecalis cells was inhibited when the bacterial cells were in solution with mucin, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and serum, and this was related to bacterial cell aggregation, as a result of interaction with agglutinins, and/or inhibition of collagen binding. When dentine was soaked in growth media containing fibrinogen, IgG, albumin or serum prior to inoculation, bacterial invasion was inhibited. It is suggested that this may be due to reduced dentine permeability as a consequence of the deposition of the compounds within dentinal tubules.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - A protocol for polymerase chain reaction detection of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from the root canal.
AB  - AIM: The present study was set up to develop a protocol for detection of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from the root canal. METHODOLOGY: A collection of type strains and clinical isolates ol E. faecalis and faecium was used. Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers targeted against the 16S/23S rDNA intergenic region were used and PCR reactions were set up. PCR products were run on TBE-agarose gel and analysed. The sensitivity of the PCR systems was studied using serial dilutions of (i) bacterial DNA and (ii) bacterial cells from E. faecalis. The specificity of the identification was tested against closely related species. RESULTS: All strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium produced identical amplicon profiles composed of two major bands corresponding to sizes of 320 and 420 bp. When amplifying DNA of higher purity, a third band of 600 bp became evident as well. Closely related species demonstrated single bands of various sizes and were easily distinguished from enterococci. The detection level of DNA from serial dilutions of DNA was 10(-13) g. The DNA extraction protocol from bacterial cell suspensions resulted in a detection level of 10 bacterial cells per sample. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated a good potential for using PCR technology in the detection of F. faecalis and E. faecium from root canal samples. With a high specificity the methodology was able to detect 10 cells of E. faecalis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - Composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tDNA-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on Columbia CNA blood agar. Sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. Forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as Enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while E. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates). Minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, Streptococcus alactolyticus and Strep. gallolyticus. Contrary to the species description of E. columbae and E. cecorum, some of the strains were found to be motile. Certain other minor differences with the species description of E. columbae are also indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus columbae is the major Gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. Certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. The potentially pathogenic Strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are rare in pigeons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. These are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.
TI  - Vitality status of microorganisms in infected human root dentine.
AB  - AIM: This experimental study was initiated to establish a method for characterizing the vitality status of bacteria in infected human root dentine by differentiating between viable and dead microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-four root segments of extracted human teeth were infected with either Streptococcus sanguinis or Enterococcus faecalis for 8 weeks. Baseline samples from root dentine (rd) were collected after 4 weeks. These were compared with samples taken at week 8 (control group: n = 12) and with samples collected at week 12 after calcium hydroxide treatment for four weeks (test group: n = 12). After marking viable and dead bacterial cells by two fluorescent dyes, the portion of viable bacteria (PVB) was determined, as well as the number of colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS: Viable and dead bacteria were identified in all "rd" samples. PVBrd values were lower than PVB values of the bacterial suspension in the root canal lumen. In the control group, PVBrd and CFUrd did not markedly differ at week 4 and at week 8, regardless of the strain used. In the test group, viable but non-culturable sanguinis streptococci (mean PVBrd = 27%; CFUrd = 0) were detected, despite calcium hydroxide treatment. The viability of E. faecalis was not affected by calcium hydroxide. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence labelling of bacteria in human root dentine gives valuable additional information about their vitality status compared to the parameter CFU. The method may be suitable for following the fate of bacteria in dentinal tubules, for example in the presence of intracanal dressings.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - A new antibiotic CJ-17,665 from Aspergillus ochraceus.
AB  - A new antibiotic, CJ-17,665 (I) was isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus ochraceus, CL41582. It inhibits growth of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, with MICs of 12.5, 12.5 and 25 microg/ml, respectively. The structure contains a diketopiperazine and an indole N-oxide moiety that is unusual in natural products.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - In vitro activity of cephalosporin RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) is a novel cephalosporin that binds to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' (PBP 2a) of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Its in vitro activity was assessed against 472 gram-positive cocci, largely selected as epidemiologically unrelated isolates with multidrug resistance. The MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, whereas they were 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), whereas they were 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible isolates. The highest MICs for MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were 2 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, but they were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, for Enterococcus faecium. For penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci, the MIC(90)s of RWJ-54428 were 0.03, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, with the highest MIC for a pneumococcus being 1 microg/ml, recorded for a strain for which penicillin and cefotaxime MICs were 8 and 4 microg/ml. MICs for Lancefield group A, B, C, and G streptococci were < or =0.008 microg/ml; those for viridans group streptococci, including isolates not susceptible to penicillin, were from 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 did not select resistant mutants of MRSA or enterococci in challenge experiments and has the potential to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Utilization of exogenous siderophores by enterococci].
AB  - The study was undertaken to investigate the ability of enterococci to assimilate  iron via siderophores of bacteria living in the same habitats in the human organism. The potential recipients of exogenous siderophores were six Enterococcus faecalis and six Enterococcus faecium strains, isolated from clinical materials of human origin. The donors of siderophores were Gram-negative rods (various species of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter) and Gram-positive cocci (various species of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus). All of the investigated E. faecium and only two E. faecalis strains demonstrated the ability to utilize the siderophores of the aforementioned bacterial groups, predominantly the chelators of Gram-negative rods, those of Gram-positive cocci were utilized to a smaller extent. Four recipient strains from E. faecalis species did not demonstrate the ability to utilize siderophores synthesized by all of 40 investigated donor strains.
TI  - Assessment of BMS284756 MIC and 5-microg disk diffusion quality control studies tested against seven American type culture collection strains.
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone with antimicrobial activity similar  to recently developed fluorinated quinolones. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the appropriate disk diffusion and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BMS284756 when used against commonly tested QC strains (M23-A2). The BMS284756 5-microg disk content was tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Hemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Seven laboratories tested 2 disk lots on 3 agar media or 3-4 broth lots over a 10 day period. A total of 420 zone diameter values and 210 or 280 MIC values per organism were generated. The following disk diffusion and MIC QC ranges were suggested for BMS284756 and the seven QC strains: E. coli ATCC 25922 (28-35 mm/0.004-0.016 microg/mL), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03-0.25 microg/mL), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (30-36 mm), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004-0.016 microg/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (19-25 mm/0.5-2 microg/mL), H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (33-41 mm/0.002-0.008 microg/mL), S. pneumoniae ATCC (26-33 mm/0.016-0.06 microg/mL). The proportion of participant results observed within the proposed ranges was 97.4-98.8% and 94.6-100% for the disk diffusion and MIC tests, respectively.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone. The in-vitro antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against 165 streptococcal isolates, 369 staphylococcal isolates, and 50 enterococcal isolates recently recovered from clinical isolates. Gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested against streptococci including penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL). Imipenem and gatifloxacin (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL) were the most active agents tested against viridans group streptococci. All the agents demonstrated excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and gatifloxacin had good activity against methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis. Among the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, gatifloxacin was the most active agent. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gatifloxacin were the most active agents against E. faecalis. Thus, gatifloxacin possesses equal or superior activity when compared to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams making it a promising new fluoroquinolone for clinical use in treating Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Enterococcal endocarditis in Sweden, 1995-1999: can shorter therapy with aminoglycosides be used?
AB  - A 5-year nationwide prospective study in Sweden during 1995-1999 identified 881 definite episodes of infective endocarditis. Definite enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed in 93 episodes (11%), the largest series of enterococcal endocarditis so far presented. Mortality during treatment was 16%, the relapse rate was 3%, and clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 81% of the episodes. Clinical cure was achieved with a median duration of cell wall-active antimicrobial therapy of 42 days combined with an aminoglycoside (median treatment time, 15 days). International guidelines generally recommend a 4-6-week combined synergistic treatment course with a cell wall-active antibiotic and an aminoglycoside. Treatment regimens in Sweden often include a shortened aminoglycoside treatment course in order to minimize adverse effects in older patients. Fatal outcome seemed not to be due to the shortened aminoglycoside therapy course. In many enterococcal endocarditis episodes, duration of aminoglycoside therapy could probably be shortened to 2-3 weeks.
TI  - Sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25.
AB  - The complete 50,237-bp DNA sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25 was determined. The plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23S RNA methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pIP501. Genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in Tn5405 from Staphylococcus aureus and in pJH1 from E. faecalis. One interrupted and five complete IS elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pRE25 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pIP501. It is concluded that pRE25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from patients in intensive care units of 25 European university hospitals participating in the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program 1997-1998.
AB  - A total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 European university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Overall, the most important species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty-nine percent of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. Moreover, all CNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. All Enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. The antimicrobial agents most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. The Enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. However, the situation for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.
TI  - Fractional maximal effect method for in vitro synergy between amoxicillin and ceftriaxone and between vancomycin and ceftriaxone against Enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - In the present study we assessed the use of a new in vitro testing method and graphical representation of the results to investigate the potential effectiveness of combinations of amoxicillin (AMZ) plus ceftriaxone (CRO) and of CRO plus vancomycin (VAN) against strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae highly resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins (PRP strains). We used the fractional maximal effect (FME) method of time-kill curves to calculate adequate concentrations of the drugs to be tested rather than relying on arbitrary choices. The concentrations obtained, each of which corresponded to a fraction of the maximal effect, were tested alone and in combination with the bacterial strains in a broth medium. Synergy was defined as a ratio of observed effect/theoretical effect, called FME, of greater than 1, additivity was defined as an FME equal to 1, and antagonism was defined as an observed effect lower than the best effect of one of the antibiotics used alone. The area between antagonism and additivity is the indifference zone. The well-known synergy between amoxicillin and gentamicin against a reference strain of Enterococcus faecalis was confirmed, with a best FME equal to 1.07. Two strains of PRP, strains PRP-1 and PRP-2, were studied. The MICs for PRP-1 and PRP-2 were as follows: penicillin, 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; AMZ, 2 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, CRO, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; and VAN, 0.5 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. For PRP-1 the best FME for the combination AMZ-CRO was 1.22 with drug concentrations of 1.68 mg/liter for AMZ and 0.17 mg/liter for CRO; the best FME for the combination VAN-CRO was 1.75 with VAN at 0.57 mg/liter and CRO at 0.17 mg/liter. For PRP-2 the best FME obtained for the combination AMZ-CRO was 1.05 with drug concentrations of 11.28 mg/liter for AMZ and 0.64 mg/liter for CRO; the best FME obtained for the combination VAN-CRO was 1.35 with VAN at 0.25 mg/liter and CRO at 1.49 mg/liter. These results demonstrated the synergy of both combinations, AMZ-CRO and VAN-CRO, against PRP strains at drug concentrations achievable in humans. Consequently, either of the combinations can be proposed for use for the treatment of PRP infections.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of acylides (3-O-acyl-erythromycin derivatives): a novel class of macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Introduction of an acyl group to the 3-O-position of erythromycin A derivatives instead of L-cladinose led to a novel class of macrolide antibiotics that we named "acylides". The 3-O-nitrophenylacetyl derivative TEA0777 showed significantly potent activity against not only erythromycin-susceptible Gram-positive pathogens but also inducibly macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and efflux-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results indicated that acylides have potential as next-generation macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - Comparative study of new benzenesulphonamide fluoroquinolones structurally related to ciprofloxacin against selected ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of benzenesulphonamide fluoroquinolones (BSFQs) I-III, new fluoroquinolones with a p-substituted benzenesulphonyl moiety attached to the C(7) piperazinyl ring of ciprofloxacin, were assessed in comparison with those of N-sulfanilylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone (NSFQ)-105 and ciprofloxacin for 133 Gram-positive clinical isolates. NSFQ-105 and BSFQ-I were the most active drugs. They were 16- to 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (eight- to 32-fold). A high degree of correlation was found between the MICs of the new compounds and ciprofloxacin for Staphylococcus spp. and E. faecalis. Staphylococci and enterococci exhibit cross-resistance to BSFQs and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against Gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against Gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs; Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout Germany. (3) MRSA isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of linezolid determined by an agar (Isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (MSSE) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant CNS (MRSE) (n=19) between 0.25 and 2 mg/l, for Enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for E. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for Streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. According to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by Gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive pathogens: a comparison with other agents and the determination of a tentative breakpoint.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was studied in comparison with other agents active against 328 recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive pathogens. MIC data showed that the addition of calcium ions to a final concentration of 50 mg/L enhanced the activity of daptomycin generally by eight- to 16-fold. In the presence of calcium ions daptomycin was uniformly active against the strains of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. studied with a MIC90 of < or = 1 mg/L. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were slightly less susceptible (MIC90 2 mg/L). Vancomycin-, fluoroquinolone- and quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant strains were all susceptible to daptomycin. The presence of serum reduced the apparent activity of daptomycin to only a moderate extent. Employing the BSAC methodologies, a tentative breakpoint of 2 mg/L for daptomycin is proposed.
TI  - The pavA gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae encodes a fibronectin-binding protein that is essential for virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx in up to 40% of healthy subjects, and is a leading cause of middle ear infections (otitis media), meningitis and pneumonia. Pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin, but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. In this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein PavA, which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. The pavA gene, present in 64 independent isolates of S. pneumoniae tested, encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to Fbp54 protein in Streptococcus pyogenes. PavA localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface, as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy, despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. Full-length recombinant PavA polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin, in a heparin-sensitive interaction, and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. However, a C-terminally truncated PavA' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. Expression of pavA in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control JH2-2 cells. Isogenic mutants of S. pneumoniae, either abrogated in PavA expression or producing a 42 kDa C-terminally truncated protein, showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin. Inactivation of pavA had no effects on growth rate, cell morphology, cell-surface physico-chemical properties, production of pneumolysin, autolysin, or surface proteins PspA and PsaA. Isogenic pavA mutants of encapsulated S. pneumoniae D39 were approximately 104-fold attenuated in virulence in the mouse sepsis model. These results provide evidence that PavA fibronectin-binding protein plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections.
TI  - Lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. The isolates were identified using tDNA-PCR. Lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. A Lactobacillus species related to L. fermentum and L. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. Three pigeons carried Enterococcus cecorum. Minor species found were E. columbae, E. faecalis, E. hirae, L. johnsonii, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus gallolyticus. A description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the L. agilis pigeon strains. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: L. agilis is found to be the main component of the LAB flora in the pigeon crop.
TI  - Comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. This study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of MB and TB against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. The effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. RESULTS: Both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light. The complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at TB concentrations of 1.5-7-fold less than that of MB. CONCLUSION: TB exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than MB against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. Mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.
TI  - A simple model host for identifying Gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several Gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or Streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult C. elegans. Focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both E. faecalis and E. faecium kill C. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only E. faecalis kills the adults. In the case of adults, a low inoculum of E. faecalis grows to a high titer in the C. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on E. faecium. Interestingly, a high titer of E. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. Two E. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. We exploit the apparent parallels between Gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an E. faecalis virulence factor, ScrB, which is relevant to mammalian pathogenesis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Determination of Enterococcus faecalis groESL full-length sequence and application for species identification.
AB  - Amplification of the partial Cpn60 (or GroEL) gene segment has been used for identification of many bacteria, including Enterococcus species. To obtain more sequence data from groESL genes of Enterococcus faecalis, the full-length sequence of the E. faecalis groESL genes containing groES (285 bp), spacer (57 bp), and groEL (1,626 bp) was determined. A database search of GenBank revealed that the deduced E. faecalis GroES and GroEL proteins show significant homology to the GroES and GroEL proteins of other bacteria. The GroEL (groEL) of E. faecalis had the highest identity with Streptococcus pneumoniae (81.8% amino acid sequence identity and 73.0% nucleotide sequence identity), followed by Lactococcus zeae, while GroES (groES) had 60.2% (64.6%) identity with Lactobacillus zeae and 58.5% (66.2%) identity with Lactococcus lactis, followed by 57.0% (65.5%) identity with Bacillus subtilis. Based on the groES sequence, an E. faecalis-specific PCR assay was developed, and this PCR assay was positive for all the E. faecalis strains tested. Dot blot hybridization using either groES or groEL as the probe distinguished E. faecalis clearly from other species, indicating that both genes can be used as suitable targets for E. faecalis identification. Moreover, broad-range PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of groESL was designed to differentiate eight commonly encountered Enterococcus species. The Enterococcus species of reference strains could be easily differentiated on the basis of restriction patterns produced by HaeIII and RsaI. The DNA-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to currently used methods of identification for clinically important enterococcal species.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  - For pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to Streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal SspB polypeptide, designated BAR. However, it does not adhere to Streptococcus mutans, which expresses SpaP, a highly conserved homolog of SspB. Comparison of the predicted secondary structure of BAR with the corresponding region of SpaP suggested that the substitution of Asn for Gly1182 and Val for Pro1185 in SspB may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in SpaP. A synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of SspB promoted avid adherence of P. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to BAR in SpaP was inactive. Substitution of Gly1182 and Pro1185 for Asn1182 and Val1185 in SspB by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an SpaP-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote P. gingivalis adherence. Furthermore, Enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of P. gingivalis cells. In contrast, P. gingivalis adhered efficiently to E. faecalis strains expressing intact SspB or SspB-SpaP chimeric proteins containing BAR. These results suggest that a region of SspB consisting of 26 amino acids is sufficient to mediate the adherence of P. gingivalis to S. gordonii and that the species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of SspB that is not conserved in SpaP.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - Bactericidal and cytotoxic effects of sodium hypochlorite and sodium dichloroisocyanurate solutions in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) were evaluated and compared in vitro. The minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of NaOCl and NaDCC were tested for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. The cytotoxic effect was assessed by using human fibroblast tissue culture. Survival rate was assessed by a protein determination method. Results showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration values of NaOCl and NaDCC for the tested bacteria were in a similar range. NaDCC in concentrations higher than 0.02%, and NaOCl in concentrations higher than 0.01% were lethal to fibroblasts. In conclusion it seems that both agents were very effective in killing bacteria, and their cytotoxicity to fibroblasts in tissue culture was similar.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis--a mechanism for its role in endodontic failure.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to identify a possible mechanism that would explain how E. faecalis could survive and grow within dentinal tubules and reinfect an obturated root canal. METHODOLOGY: Cells of Streptococcus gordonii DL1, Streptococcus mutans NG8, or E. faecalis JH2-2 were grown in brain heart infusion broth containing various amounts of human serum for 56 days. The ability of the three species to invade dentine and bind to immobilized type I collagen in the presence of human serum was assessed by dentine invasion and microtitre well experiments. RESULTS: All three species remained viable over the period of the experiment when grown in human serum. Cells of all three bacteria were able to invade dentine and bind to immobilized collagen. Both of these properties were inhibited by the presence of collagen in the cell solution. Human serum inhibited dentine invasion and collagen adhesion by S. gordonii DL1 and S. mutans NG8, whilst dentine invasion by E. faecalis JH2-2 was reduced in the presence of serum, but not inhibited, and binding to collagen was enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that a virulence factor of E. faecalis in failed endodontically treated teeth may be related to the ability of E. faecalis cells to maintain the capability to invade dentinal tubules and adhere to collagen in the presence of human serum.
TI  - Control of microorganisms in vitro by calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of vehicles on the antimicrobial efficiency of calcium hydroxide. METHODOLOGY: A total of 588 size 50 sterile absorbent paper points, were immersed in various microbial suspensions for 3 min. The points were then placed on Petri dishes and covered with intracanal dressings containing calcium hydroxide: Ca(OH)2 + saline; Ca(OH)2 + camphorated paramonochlorophenol; Ca(OH)2 + 1% chlorhexidine solution: Ca(OH)2 + 3% sodium lauryl sulphate; Ca(OH)2 + Otosporin. After 1 min, 48 and 72 h and 7 days, 147 absorbent paper cones were removed from contact with the intracanal dressings and individually transported and immersed in 5 mL of Letheen Broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Microbial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. A 0.1-mL inoculum obtained from the Letheen Broth was transferred to 5 mL of BHI, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was again evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. Positive BHI tubes were selected and inocula were spread on the surface of BHI agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Gram staining of the BHI growth and from colonies growing on BHI agar was carried out. RESULTS: An antimicrobial effect occurred after 48 h on the cultures of S. mutans, E. faecalis, S. aureus, P aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans and a mixed culture, irrespective of the intracanal dressing. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the various vehicles associated with calcium hydroxide pastes did not influence the time required for microbial inactivation.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  - AIM: The bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. METHODOLOGY: Single-species biofilms of Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a control. The antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. RESULTS: Iodine and NaOCl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against P. micros and P. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. Iodine and NaOCl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. However, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. None of the agents were effective against F. nucleatum after 15 min but NaOCl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. Colloidal silver was generally ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. NaOCl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. However the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Cholesterol embolism causing delayed healing of a foot ulcer.
AB  - A cholesterol embolism presents with various systemic and local manifestations giving rise to a diagnostic dilemma. We report a case of cholesterol embolism of the leg that delayed the healing of a foot ulcer, necessitating a toe amputation. This report points to the potential of cholesterol emboli to cause a significant compromise in the vascular supply.
TI  - Comparative killing kinetics of the novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756, fluoroquinolones, vancomycin and beta-lactams.
AB  - The primary bactericidal classes used therapeutically as single agents, are the quinolones and the cell-wall active agents. In this study, their rates of killing were compared. The des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756 (T-3811ME), fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, levofloxacin) and cell wall-active agents (beta-lactams, vancomycin) were evaluated against Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. Time-kill analysis was done at 10x the MIC, using Mueller-Hinton broth (supplemented with 7% lysed horse blood for Streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci), or Brain Heart Infusion broth for beta-haemolytic streptococci. Using a 3-log(10) decrease in viable count as an index of bactericidal activity, BMS-284756 and the fluoroquinolones killed Enterobacteriaceae rapidly, requiring < 2 h versus > or =6 h for beta-lactams. The staphylococcal cell counts generally decreased more rapidly with quinolone exposure, compared with those treated with vancomycin or the beta-lactams. The antimicrobial agents killed streptococci and enterococci more slowly, requiring > 6 h to decrease the viable count by 99.9%. In summary, BMS-284756 killing rates are similar to those of recent fluoroquinolones and are bacterial group-dependent. Overall, the quinolones are more rapidly bactericidal than vancomycin and the beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Multi-laboratory assessment of the linezolid spectrum of activity using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method: Report of the Zyvox Antimicrobial Potency Study (ZAPS) in the United States.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid against common Gram-positive pathogens was compared to that of penicillin or ampicillin or oxacillin (depending upon genus), cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin by disk diffusion methods. One hundred and six centers (31 states in US) tested recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococci. Testing was conducted using the standardized disk diffusion method and concurrent quality control testing was performed. Strains with linezolid zone diameters of < or = 20 mm were requested for referral to the microbiology monitor for confirmation. A total of 3,100 isolates (97% compliance) were tested. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 21 mm) of staphylococci and streptococci to linezolid was reported in 100% and 99.4% of staphylococci and streptococci, respectively. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 23 mm) of enterococci to linezolid was 96.0% with only three isolates (0.4%) reported as resistant (zone diameters, < or = 20 mm; unconfirmed). Among a total of nine isolates (0.3%) reported to have zone diameters 20 mm, six were not submitted for further testing, two were contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli and one was determined to be linezolid-susceptible. There were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin- or oxacillin- or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains. This susceptibility pattern for US medical centers is indicative of the excellent and nearly complete in vitro activity against the key Gram-positive pathogens for which linezolid has received US Food and Drug Administration indications for clinical use.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of certain quinolone derivatives.
AB  - A number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. Preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. Among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log GI(50) of -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log GI(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.
TI  - Characterization of selected strains of pneumococcal surface protein A.
AB  - Several proteins, in addition to the polysaccharide capsule, have recently been implicated in the full virulence of the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial pathogen. One of these novel virulence factors of S. pneumoniae is pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA). The N-terminal, cell surface exposed, and functional part of PspA is essential for full pneumococcal virulence, as evidenced by the fact that antibodies raised against this part of the protein are protective against pneumococcal infections. PspA has recently been implicated in anti-complementary function as it reduces complement-mediated clearance and phagocytosis of pneumococci. Several recombinant N-terminal fragments of PspA from different strains of pneumococci, Rx1, BG9739, BG6380, EF3296, and EF5668, were analyzed using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods, and sequence homology. Uniformly, all strains of PspA molecules studied have a high alpha-helical secondary structure content and they adopt predominantly a coiled-coil structure with an elongated, likely rod-like shape. No beta-sheet structures were detected for any of the PspA molecules analyzed. All PspAs were found to be monomeric in solution with the exception of the BG9739 strain which had the propensity to partially aggregate but only into a tetrameric form. These structural properties were correlated with the functional, anti-complementary properties of PspA molecules based on the polar distribution of highly charged termini of its coiled-coil domain. The recombinant Rx1 PspA is currently under consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development.
TI  - [Post-traumatic bacterial meningitis].
AB  - 10 patients with posttraumatic bacterial meningitis were treated in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Jagielloniam University--Collegium Medicum during the period of 63 months. Traffic accidents were responsible for 80% of all cases of trauma. The most common place of injury was the base of anterior cranial fossa. Infecting agent was established in 8 cases. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus spp.) were found in 4 patients, Gram-negative aerobic cocci (Neisseria meningitidis) in 2 patients, and Gram-negative aerobic rods (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli) in 3 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was still highly sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Neisseria meningitidis was sensitive to penicillin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulonate. Gram negative aerobic rods were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Among 10 patients treated for posttraumatic bacterial meningitis 1 patient died and in 1 preserved vegetative state was diagnosed. In 4 patients severe or moderate disabilities developed, however 4 recovered completely. 6 patients after regression of the CNS infection were qualified to neurosurgical intervention. In 3 patients reconstructive operation of the basis of anterior cranial fossa with tissue glue Beriplast P. was done, the recovery was complete. 3 patients didn't agree to surgical operation, and we don't know what has happened with them. They have not come to the control visit.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from 3 patients with infection at a pierced body site.
AB  - We describe 3 adolescents who developed infections due to anaerobes at pierced body sites: the nipple, the umbilicus, and the nasal septum. Anaerobes (Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) were recovered from pure culture of specimens obtained from 1 patient with nipple infection and were mixed with aerobic bacteria in cultures of specimens obtained from 2 patients (Streptococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella melaninogenica were recovered from a patient with nasal septum infection, and Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered from a patient with umbilical infection). The infection resolved in all patients after removal of the ornaments and use of antimicrobial drug treatment.
TI  - Post-antibiotic growth suppression of linezolid against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against Gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed using the sigmoid E(max) model for mathematically modelling the PAE. Mean maximal linezolid PAEs against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the PAE. Results of PAE testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.
TI  - Intrauterine infection may be a major cause of stillbirth in Sweden.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate intrauterine infection as a cause for unexplained stillbirth. METHODS: Chorioamnionitis was studied in a material of stillbirths (117 subjects from the years 1985-1994) from a region in the south Sweden. Control material (126 alive and healthy newborns and with healthy mothers) was gathered from the same region. RESULTS: Chorioamnionitis was a common diagnosis both with stillbirths and 'healthy' deliveries (82 and 68%, respectively). Extension of the inflammation to decidua basalis was seven times more common among stillbirths than among controls (odds ratio 7.2, confidence interval 2.8-21.9). The most common bacteria found at cultures were Escherichia coli, Coagulase negative staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis and group B Streptococcus. The risk for stillbirth was doubled if both inflammation and bacteria were present (odds ratio 2.3, confidence interval 0.92-5.8). Meconium discharge was more common among stillbirths than controls (odds ratio=4.7, confidence interval 1.7-14). There were no differences in any respect regarding macerated and non-macerated stillbirths. Our findings are similar to the results from studies in developing countries except for the higher incidence of stillbirths in such countries. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, a large part of otherwise unexplained stillbirths might be due to ascending infections.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - The replicon of the cryptic Plasmid pSBO1 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - The cryptic plasmid pSBO1 (3904 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. pSBO1 contained an open reading frame (ORF) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (Rep) in pEFC1 (isolated from Enterococcus faecalis), pSK639 (Staphylococcus epidermidis), pLA103 (Lactobacillus acidophilus), and pUCL287 (Tetragenococcus halophila). In addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (DRs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of pSBO1. Recombinant plasmids (pSBE10 and pSBE11) containing the DRs and putative rep of pSBO1 replicated in S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8 strains. This result indicates that the putative rep encoded Rep and that the replicon of pSBO1 contained the DRs and the rep. Gel shift assays showed that the Rep of pSBO1 bound the 22-bp DRs.
TI  - Identification of novel essential Escherichia coli genes conserved among pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - We deleted a subset of 27 open reading frames (ORFs) from Escherichia coli which  encode previously uncharacterized, probably soluble gene products homologous to proteins from a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and only distantly related to eukaryotic proteins. Six novel bacteria-specific genes essential for growth in complex medium could be identified through a combination of bioinformatics-based and experimental approaches. We also compared our data to published results of gene inactivation projects with Mycoplasma genitalium and Bacillus subtilis and looked for homologs in all known prokaryotic genomes. Such analyses highlight the enormous metabolic flexibility of prokaryotes. Six of 27 studied genes have been functionally characterized up to now, amongst these four of the essential genes. The gene products YgbP, YgbB and YchB are involved in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. KdtB is characterized as the posphopantetheine adenylyltransferase CoaD. There are indications that the other two essential gene products YjeE and YqgF, which we have identified, also possess enzymatic functions. These findings demonstrate the potential of such proteins to be used in screening of large chemical libraries for inhibitors which could be further developed to novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in Europe and Australia.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826, L-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. Its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in Europe and Australia, with imipenem, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. Ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. Ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and Moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its MIC(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most Enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. Ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional NCCLS MIC breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them Enterobacter aerogenes. Resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 Bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 Clostridium difficile strain. Ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which MICs were as high as 2 microg/ml. Of 234 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem MICs of 2 microg/ml and one required an MIC of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-Streptococcus pyogenes, non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem MICs of 2 and 16 microg/ml. These streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem. The Etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.
TI  - Resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  - We studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. No spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for Staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for Streptococcus pneumoniae). Population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. Assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. Stable S. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. The daptomycin MICs for these isolates were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. Many mutants with high MICs (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of S. aureus small colony variants. The voltage component (Delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. In vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. For other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. These results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.
TI  - Bacteria isolated after unsuccessful endodontic treatment in a North American population.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial flora present in teeth after the failure of root canal therapy in a North American population. These results were then compared with those of the previous Scandinavian studies. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-four root-filled teeth with persistent periapical radiolucencies were selected for retreatment. After removal of the root-filling material, the canals were sampled with paper points, and by reaming of the apical dentin. Both samples were grown under aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions. Then the bacterial growth was analyzed. RESULTS: The microbial flora was mainly of 1 to 2 strains of predominantly gram-positive organisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most commonly recovered bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were cultivated in 34 of the 54 teeth examined in the study. E faecalis was identified in 30% of the teeth with a positive culture.
TI  - New gene cluster for lantibiotic streptin possibly involved in streptolysin S formation.
AB  - Streptolysin S (SLS) is a serum-extractable and oxygen-stable hemolysin produced  by Group A Streptococcus. A SLS-deficient mutant in which transposon Tn 916 was inserted in a locus distinct from the sag gene cluster [Nizet et al. (2000) Infect. Immun. 68, 4245-4254] was obtained by filter mating of the transposon-harbouring Enterococcus faecalis strain and Streptococcus pyogenes BL(T). This mutant, N22, had completely lost the hemolytic activity, in consequence of insertion of a single Tn 916 into a hitherto-unknown lantibiotic gene cluster composed of 10 open reading frames. The arrangement and sequence of this lantibiotic gene cluster were similar to those of nisin and subtilin, and so we designated this new lantibiotic as streptin. The bactericidal activity of streptin was abolished on treatment with trypsin or proteinase K. The different host range and nucleotide sequence clearly distinguished streptin from streptococcins. Streptin was not hemolytic and its bacteriocin activity was independent of carrier oligonucleotides effective for SLS. The fact that N22 also lost the anti-bacterial activity against indicator streptococci reveals that the factor(s) required for lantibiotic formation plays an important role in SLS formation as well.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - The Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmid pAM373 does not encode an  entry exclusion function.
AB  - pAM373 is a conjugative plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis that confers a mating response to the peptide sex pheromone cAM373 which is produced also by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus gordonii. Unlike other sex pheromone-inducible plasmids, pAM373 does not confer an entry exclusion phenotype.
TI  - Comparison of statistical methods for identification of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA patterns.
AB  - Thermophilic streptococci play an important role in the manufacture of many European cheeses, and a rapid and reliable method for their identification is needed. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR (RAPD-PCR) with two different primers coupled to hierarchical cluster analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for the classification and typing of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis (G. Moschetti, G. Blaiotta, M. Aponte, P. Catzeddu, F. Villani, P. Deiana, and S. Coppola, J. Appl. Microbiol. 85:25-36, 1998). In order to develop a fast and inexpensive method for the identification of thermophilic streptococci, RAPD-PCR patterns were generated with a single primer (XD9), and the results were analyzed using artificial neural networks (Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function network, and Bayesian network) and multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees). Cluster analysis allowed the identification of S. thermophilus but not of enterococci. A Bayesian network proved to be more effective than a Multilayer Perceptron or a Radial Basis Function network for the identification of S. thermophilus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis using simplified RAPD-PCR patterns (obtained by summing the bands in selected areas of the patterns). The Bayesian network also significantly outperformed two multivariate statistical techniques (linear discriminant analysis and classification trees) and proved to be less sensitive to the size of the training set and more robust in the response to patterns belonging to unknown species.
TI  - Production, purification and some properties of Bac201, a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance produced by Staphylococcus aureus AB201.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus AB201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as Bac201, that was inhibitory to Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. It was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (BioSil-SEC-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C4). The native Bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kDa as determined by GF HPLC. Fraction-I (native Bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. The purification of Bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. The purified Bac201 migrated as single band on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kDa. Bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of pH (2.5-10). The amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and alanine (8%) residues. Further results showed that Bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent loss of membrane permeability.
TI  - Aggregation substance-mediated adherence of Enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  - Aggregation substance (AS) of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. The influence of pAD1-encoded AS, Asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. The presence of AS increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more than three-fold, and to collagen type I more than two-fold (P<0.001). In contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type IV occurred independently of AS. Adherence of the constitutively AS expressing E. faecalis OG1X(pAM721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of Streptococcus bovis. Investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. Thus, AS may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.
TI  - [Identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  - We developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. The susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. Any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. The combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. The second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. This subgrouping procedure was done every three months. Identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. The algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Enterococcus faecalis (EF), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Escherichia coli (EC) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. Three major subtypes of MRSA, KP and EF were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. Most of EC isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. Although PA and SP had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. This analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of teicoplanin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The glycopeptide susceptibility of 443 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci collected from nine general hospitals in 1996 was determined according to the recommendations of the CA-SFM (the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology). In total, 234 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 84 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 98 enterococci and 27 streptococci were collected. The mecA gene confirming resistance to methicillin was found in 42.7% of S. aureus isolates and 51.2% of CNS isolates. No resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin was found in S. aureus but four isolates of CNS had an MIC of teicoplanin > or = 8 mg/L. All isolates of Enterococcus faecalis tested were susceptible to both glycopeptides. This study confirms that teicoplanin has a very good in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, isolated in France from nosocomial infections.
TI  - Growth inhibitory activity of gutta-percha points containing root canal medications on common endodontic bacterial pathogens as determined by an optimized quantitative in vitro assay.
AB  - Gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide (ZnO), a mixture of  ZnO and chlorhexidine (ZnO/CHX), iodine-polyvinylpyrrolidone (ZnO/J-PVP), or a mixture of CHX and J-PVP and ZnO (ZnO/CHX/J-PVP) were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of pure cultures of bacterial species commonly involved in endodontic infections (Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis). To quantitate growth inhibition, an in vitro assay was established that controlled for important parameters of root canal infection. Approximately 10(7) bacteria per assay were suspended in diluted human serum and co-incubated with the gutta-percha points in an anaerobic atmosphere for up to 2 wk. Aliquots used for determination of colony counts were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation. As judged by colony-forming unit reduction kinetics and final counts, calcium hydroxide had better growth inhibitory activity than ZnO/CHX, ZnO/J-PVP, and ZnO alone for all bacteria tested except Peptostreptococcus micros. The combination of CHX and J-PVP with ZnO did not render results different from those of ZnO/CHX or ZnO/J-PVP. The results of this study support the introduction of standardized assays for testing antibacterial properties of root canal medications under conditions that more closely resemble those encountered in endodontal infections.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  - Endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located in confined areas of the root canal system. The antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT, Grossman's Sealer, ThermaSeal, Sealer 26, AH Plus, and Sealer Plus. The agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. In the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. The diameters of the formed discs were recorded. All root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. There were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). All root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that AH Plus and Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.
TI  - Expression of the major heat shock proteins DnaK and GroEL in Streptococcus pyogenes: a comparison to Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - One of the outstanding problems in the field of heat shock response has been to elucidate the mechanism underlying the induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this work, we initiate an analysis of the expression of heat shock groEL and dnaK genes and their promoters in S. pyogenes. The synthesis of total cellular proteins was studied upon transfer of a log-phase culture from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C by performing 5-min pulse-labeling experiments with (35)S-Met. The heat shock responses in the pathogenic Gram-positive cocci, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, were also analyzed.
TI  - Dermatan sulphate is released by proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria and inactivates antibacterial alpha-defensin.
AB  - Defensins represent an evolutionarily conserved group of small peptides with potent antibacterial activities. We report here that extracellular proteinases secreted by the human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes release dermatan sulphate by degrading dermatan sulphate-containing proteoglycans, such as decorin. Dermatan sulphate was found to bind to neutrophil-derived alpha-defensin, and this binding completely neutralized its bactericidal activity. During infection, proteoglycan degradation and release of dermatan sulphate may therefore represent a previously unknown virulence mechanism, which could serve as a target for novel antibacterial strategies.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. Chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Five strains of Hemolytic streptococci group B (GBS) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: Hemolytic streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Lactobacillus species. Bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. Consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). In experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. All strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group A, S. aureus and S. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in combination with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (FIC) and time-kill analysis methods. In the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In no incidence was antagonism (FIC > or = 4) or synergy (FIC < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (FIC > 0.5, < 4). By time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x MIC in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits MIC. These combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. However, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against E. faecalis. These findings indicate that, with the exception of E. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Tongue abscess. Report of a case and bibliographic review].
AB  - We report a case of tongue abscess due to Streptococcus faecalis. Tongue abscesses are rare infections in our region, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The CT scan provides important diagnostic information for this disease. Treatment is surgical incision and drainage associated with antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of certain plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
AB  - Eighteen crude extracts, including six hexanic, six chloroformic and six methanolic from six different plant species used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory infections, were evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each extract using a two-fold dilution assay. The results showed that 16 crude extracts (89%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or below. The extracts from Gnaphalium oxyphyllum, Gnaphalium americanum, and Crescentia alata possessed strong antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested.
TI  - Use of preclinical data for selection of a phase II/III dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical MIC breakpoint.
AB  - One of the most challenging issues in the design of phase II/III clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. The choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the MIC, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. It is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of MICs for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the PK parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the PD target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. In performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and determined the MICs using E-test methods (AB Biodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. Population PK data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using NPEM III. PD targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: S. pneumoniae (n = 5), E. faecalis (n = 2), and S. aureus (n = 4). Drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/MIC (AUC/MIC) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. There were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) CFU), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or 90% maximal killing effect (90% E(max)). The levels of protein binding in humans and mice were similar. The PK and PD of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five Monte Carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. The fractional probability of attaining the three PD targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. All differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target AUC/MIC in this PD model were significant. For S. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three PD targets was high for both doses. For S. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (S. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% E(max) AUC/MIC targets. This same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro MIC breakpoints.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin from clinical trials 1997-1998.
AB  - MICs of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 3482 pre-treatment, clinical trial isolates collected during 1997-1998 are reported. These data suggested that gatifloxacin was four- to eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, with gatifloxacin MIC(90)s < or = 0.33 mg/l against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and < or = 1.0 mg/l versus viridans streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Both quinolones had similar MIC(90)s versus Enterobacteriaceae (generally < or = 0.38 mg/l, except 0. 7-0.8 mg/l for Citrobacter freundii) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( approximately 8 mg/l). A total of 78% P. aeruginosa had gatifloxacin MICs < or = 2 mg/l. Gatifloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter species and non-P. aeruginosa pseudomonads. Both had exceptional activity versus Haemophilus spp, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In summary, compared to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin had improved activity against Gram-positive bacteria and comparable activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro Activity of Meropenem Versus Other Extended-Spectrum Antimicrobial Agents Against 2,085 Clinical Isolates Tested in 13 Brazilian Centers.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is the second agent of its class to become available in Brazil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. This study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 Brazilian states. A total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between December 1995 and March 1996 were susceptibility tested using the Etest and following the NCCLS procedures. Meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/mL, except for Citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). Generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against Gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (MIC50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (MIC 50,3 microg/mL). Imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some Gram-positive specees oxacillin, including Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 50 of 0.75 microg/mL and 2 microg/mL respectively), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/mL and 0.094 microg/mL), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC 50 of 0.064 microg/mL and 0.5mg/mL). Against Streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (MIC 50, 0.016 microg/mL). The results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in Brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. The Linezolid Study Group.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst Gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. A total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the Etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 Staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and 996 enterococci. To ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. The resistance rates to methicillin among S. aureus and CNS were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with MRSA rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. No glycopeptide resistance was seen in S. aureus, but 6.5% of CNS isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. Vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among Enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than E. faecalis (0.5%) (P<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vanA. The rate of penicillin resistance in pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%), with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by mefE. All the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/L. The modal MICs of linezolid were 1 mg/L for CNS and pneumococci, and 2 mg/L for S. aureus and enterococci. Linezolid was the most potent agent tested against Gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of Gram-positive infections in hospitals.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor Tu in enterococci.
AB  - The elongation factor Tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a GTP binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. One to three tuf genes per genome are present, depending on the bacterial species. Most low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. We have designed degenerate PCR primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned inserts containing putative amplicons. Two different tuf genes (tufA and tufB) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus pseudoavium, and Enterococcus raffinosus. For the other six enterococcal species (Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sulfureus, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, and Enterococcus solitarius), only the tufA gene was present. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. The presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufA gene branches with the Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufB gene clusters with the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus. Primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufB genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and Lactococcus lactis. The data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.
TI  - Identification of a Porphyromonas gingivalis receptor for the Streptococcus gordonii SspB protein.
AB  - Colonization of the plaque biofilm by the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis  is favored by the presence of antecedent organisms such as Streptococcus gordonii. Coadhesion between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii can be mediated by the SspB protein of S. gordonii; however, the P. gingivalis cognate receptor for this protein has not been identified. In this study, we identified a surface protein of P. gingivalis that interacts with the SspB protein. Coprecipitation between P. gingivalis outer membrane proteins and purified SspB protein demonstrated that a 100-kDa P. gingivalis protein bound to SspB. The 100-kDa protein also bound to an engineered strain of Enterococcus faecalis that expresses the SspB protein on the cell surface. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 100-kDa protein inhibited the binding between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii in a dose-dependent manner up to 86%. Amino acid sequencing of the 100-kDa protein showed homology to a protein previously identified as the P. gingivalis minor fimbria. The minor fimbrial protein may exist as a complex with a hemagglutinin-like protein since the genes encoding these proteins are adjacent on the chromosome and are cotranscribed. Thus, the P. gingivalis receptor for S. gordonii SspB is a 100-kDa protein that structurally may be a minor fimbria-protein complex and functionally effectuates coadhesion.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - To understand quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan, where this agent is not yet available for clinical use, we evaluated 1,287 nonduplicate isolates recovered from January 1996 to December 1999 for in vitro susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and other newer antimicrobial agents. All methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. High rates of nonsusceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (MICs, >/=2 microg/ml) were demonstrated for the following organisms: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (31%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), viridans group streptococci (51%), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (85%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (66%), Leuconostoc spp. (100%), Lactobacillus spp. (50%), and Pediococcus spp. (87%). All isolates of MSSA, MRSA, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The rates of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin were 5 and 7%, respectively, for CoNS, ranging from 12 and 18% for S. simulans to 0 and 0% for S. cohnii and S. auricularis. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin had good activities against these isolates except for ciprofloxacin-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. In Taiwan, virginiamycin has been used in animal husbandry for more than 20 years, which may contribute to the high rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: MYSTIC Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647), three macrolides, amoxycillin, cefdinir and levofloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activities (MIC and MBC) of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against clinical isolates in Japan were investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, amoxycillin, cefdinir and levofloxacin. Telithromycin was more potent than the reference compounds against erythromycin A-susceptible or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates possessing either mef (mefA or mefE) genes or the ermB gene. Against erythromycin A-susceptible or inducibly resistant Staphylococcus aureus and erythromycin A-susceptible and intermediate Enterococcus faecalis, telithromycin was highly active.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - The photocatalytic disinfection of urban waste waters.
AB  - In this paper we present the results of the photocatalytic disinfection of urban  waste water. Two microbial groups, total coliforms and Streptococcus faecalis, have been used as indexes to test disinfection efficiencies. Different experimental parameters have been checked, such as the effect of TiO2, solar or UV-lamp light and pH. Disinfection of water samples has been achieved employing both UV-lamp and solar light in agreement with data shown by other authors. The higher disinfection rates obtained employing an UV-lamp may be explained by the stronger incident light intensity. Nevertheless no consistent differences have been found between TiO2-photocatalysis and direct solar or UV-lamp light irradiation at natural sample pH (7.8). At pH 5 the presence of TiO2 increases the relative inactivation rate compared with the absence of the catalyst. After the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation, the later bacterial reappearance was checked for total coliforms at natural pH and pH 5, with and without TiO2. Two h after the photocatalytic treatment, CFU increment was almost nill. But 24 and 48 h later an important bacterial CFU increment was observed. This CFU increment is slower after irradiation with TiO2 at pH 5 in non-air-purged samples.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - The LE1 bacteriophage replicates as a plasmid within Leptospira biflexa: construction of an L. biflexa-Escherichia coli shuttle vector.
AB  - We have discovered that LE1, one of the plaque-forming phages previously described as lytic for the Leptospira biflexa saprophytic spirochete (I. Saint Girons, D. Margarita, P. Amouriaux, and G. Baranton, Res. Microbiol. 141:1131-1138, 1990), was indeed temperate. LE1 was found to be unusual, as Southern blot analysis indicated that it is one of the few phages to replicate in the prophage state as a circular plasmid. The unavailability of such small endogenous replicons has hindered genetic experimentation in Leptospira. We have developed a shuttle vector with DNA derived from LE1. Random LE1 DNA fragments were cloned into a pGEM 7Zf(+) derivative devoid of most of the bla gene but carrying a kanamycin resistance marker from the gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis. These constructs were transformed into L. biflexa strain Patoc 1 by electroporation, giving rise to kanamycin-resistant transformants. A 2.2-kb fragment from LE1 was responsible for replication of the vector in L. biflexa. However, a larger region including an intact parA gene homologue was necessary for the stability of the shuttle vector. Direct repeats and AT-rich regions characterized the LE1 origin of replication. Our data indicate that the replicon derived from the LE1 leptophage, together with the kanamycin resistance gene, is a promising tool with which to develop the genetics of Leptospira species.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pAM373: complete nucleotide sequence and genetic analyses of sex pheromone response.
AB  - pAM373 is a 36.7 kb conjugative plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis that encodes a response to a peptide sex pheromone, cAM373, secreted by plasmid-free (recipient) strains of enterococci. It was identified over 15 years ago as one of five plasmids in E. faecalis strain RC73 and was of interest because a related pheromone activity could be detected in culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus gordonii. Because of increased clinical concern relating to the possibility of mobilizing vancomycin resistance determinants from enterococci, where they are becoming common, into pathogens such as S. aureus, efforts were initiated to characterize pAM373 further. The results of a complete nucleotide sequence determination of pAM373, as well as a genetic analysis of key genes related to regulation of the pheromone response, are reported here. With regard to determinants related to conjugation, the plasmid has a structural organization similar to other known pheromone-responsive plasmids such as pAD1, pCF10 and pPD1; however, there are several unique features. Although there are significant homologues relating to a pheromone-binding surface protein (TraC) and a negatively regulating protein (TraA), there is an absence of a determinant equivalent to traB of pAD1 (reduces endogenous pheromone) and a determinant for surface-exclusion protein. The precursor structure of the inhibitor peptide iAM373 was identified, and its determinant (iam373) was found to be about 500 nt upstream of an apparent transcription terminator t1. Tn917-lac insertion analyses provided interesting insights into aspects of control of the pheromone response and showed that, although the traA product is sensitive to pheromone, it appears to act differently from the traA homologue of pAD1.
TI  - In vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and recombinant single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 3: Modification of ring-B.
AB  - Ring-B derivatization of totarol (1) afforded the series of compounds 2-22 which  were screened in vitro against: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several of the derivatives retained much of the antibacterial activity of totatol against the first three of these organisms (all gram-positive), but none was more active. The gram-negative Klebsiella was resistant to all compounds examined. Totarol (1) was shown to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria at 50 microM.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 2: Modifications at C-12 and O-13.
AB  - Alterations of the C-12 and C-13 aromatic ring substituents of totarol (1) afforded the series of derivatives 2-14, and introduction of substituents at C-12 gave exclusively 2a-14a. The majority of these analogues were tested in vitro against the following organisms: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results were evaluated in terms of structure-activity relationship which reveals that: (a) the phenolic moiety at C-13, in general, is essential for antibacterial activity at < 32 microg/mL against gram-positive species, and (b) derivatization at C-12 has an undesirable effect on the antibacterial activity of this class of compounds, while (c) all compounds tested are ineffective against the gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in Hiroshima City to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. Hiroshima Levofloxacin Susceptibility Surveillance Group].
AB  - To evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in Hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. Among Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. To reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. Drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
TI  - Identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  - The mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria perflava/sicca and Neisseria mucosa and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, Kingella denitrificans, M. catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, N. perflava/sicca, and N. mucosa at similar frequencies. The mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effects of cerium-humic acid complex: an experimental study.
AB  - The bacteriostatic potency of the cerium-humic acid complex was evaluated by experimental measurement of this complex interaction with E. coli, Bacillus pyocyaneus, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus faecalis, and by comparison bacteriostatic effects with the cerium-citrate complex. The experimental results indicated that the cerium-humic acid complex strongly inhibited growth of all five bacterial strains, and its diameter of bacteriostatic circles were more than 30 mm. The minimal bacteria-inhibiting concentration were 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/L for E. coli and Bacillus pyocyaneus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Leuconostoc and Streptococcus faecalis individually, and the measured minimal bactericidal concentrations were 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/L for Bacillus pyocyaneus, E. coli, and Leuconostoc. To kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, the concentration had to be more than 1 x 10(-20 mol/L. On the contrary, we found that cerium-citrate complex did not inhibit the growth of the above five bacteria, but stimulated bacterial growth. The completely different bacteriostatic results of two cerium complexes may hint that the association and chemical properties of the two complexes were different.
TI  - Characterization of OpuA, a glycine-betaine uptake system of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A Lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli proP proU mutant with a gene library from L. lactis sbsp. cremoris. The cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opuA, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of Bacillus subtilis. Disruption of opuA in L. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. OpuA belongs to the so-called "ABC transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. In B. subtilis OpuA system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. In contrast, in the L. lactis opuA operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. Mapping of L. lactis opuA transcription start identified one mRNA, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. Construction of an opuA-gusA fusion confirmed that opuA transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in L. lactis. When recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of E. coli, the opuA promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in L. lactis.
TI  - [Extensive Fournier's gangrene: a case report].
AB  - We report a case of extensive Fournier's gangrene that could not be rescued despite emergent debridement. A 51-year-old man presented at another hospital with cough, diarrhea and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with acute enteritis and hospitalized. The next morning, he became severely hypotensive and his scrotum was swollen and black. The perineal skin also was black. Septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation were suspected. He was transferred to our emergency room, and was immediately diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene and acute peritonitis. Computed tomographic scan revealed soft-tissue gas in the scrotum, the retroperitoneal cavity and the abdominal wall. Emergent debridement and laparotomy was performed. Gangrene was also seen at the intestinal wall and the peritoneum, however, resection of intestine was not done because of his poor performance status. Although potent antibiotics and catecholamine were administered, he died of multiple organ failure 29 hours after the operation. This is the first case of Fournier's gangrene extending into the abdominal cavity reported in the Japanese literature.
TI  - Evaluation of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) and RPR 106972 stability in susceptibility testing media.
AB  - In response to conflicting reports on the chemical stability of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a study was designed to assess the in vitro longevity and effects of media and storage conditions on this streptogramin combination. Broth microdilution trays containing parenteral (quinupristin/dalfopristin) and oral (RPR 106972) streptogramin combinations as well as pristinomycin components (P-I and P-II) were preincubated at 35 degrees C for 12-72 h before inoculation with control strains (Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) and five clinical isolates with various drug resistance phenotypes. Overall, the mean quinupristin/dalfopristin activity loss was 24%/12 h, 41%/18 h, 43%/24 h, 69%/48 h and 79%/72 h with no detected loss of potency when measured by E. faecalis until 18 h. RPR 106972 mean activity loss was 6%/12 h, 19%/18 h, 19%/24 h, 56%/48 h and 71%/72 h with no loss of potency as measured by S. aureus until 48 h. Overall, P-I components had greater stability as compared with P-II for both drug combinations. Bioassays showed similar trends in decreased activity. Bioassay differences among media types were only significant (> 3 mm; greater loss of potency) for haemophilus test media for both P-II components at 72 h. The presence of an organism in the medium had no effect on stability assay results. The effect of storage temperature (4, 25 degrees C) on quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 stability was also detrimental to drug potency indicating the requirement for rigid quality assurance for streptogramin diagnostic reagents when determining activity by reference or standardized susceptibility tests.
TI  - Evaluation of gemifloxacin (SB-265805, LB20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (GEMI), formerly SB-265805 and LB20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. The present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. The reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. Selected results (number strains tested; MIC90 for GEMI/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for GEMI/trovafloxacin) were: Staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), S. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), Enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), E. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). Gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. Continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.
TI  - [Streptococcus faecalis in the environment: species identification and antibiotic resistance].
AB  
TI  - A new rapid automated method for the detection of Listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  - Many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of Listeria spp. Spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by Listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges, were automatically monitored by the BioSys instrument in a semifluid layer (SFL). The blackening of SFL in modified MOX broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. The instrument detected all nine strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested. None of the gram negative organisms (Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Yersinia) were detected by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on PALCAM and Oxford media and were also detected in the system. A total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. Of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. L. innocua was the dominant Listeria species in these environmental samples. Good correlation was obtained between numbers of Listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 CFU/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 CFU/swab were detected in less than 22 h. The total assay time was 26 h.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a potent antibacterial agent, NH125 against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - New imidazole compounds were synthesized to develop a novel and effective antibacterial agent (1-benzyl-3-cetyl-2-methylimidazolium iodide, NH125). In vitro experiments demonstrated that NH125 effectively inhibited a number of different histidine protein kinases. Furthermore, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRS), and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were found to be very sensitive to NH125.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Sinusitis as a cause of orbital cellulitis.
AB  - To determine the importance of sinusitis as a cause of orbital cellulitis, the causative organisms and peak age of occurrence, 25 patients hospitalized with orbital cellulitis (ages 8 months to 17 years; 80%, 1-4 years) were studied. Complete blood counts were carried out and radiographic sinus examinations and eye swabs (for culturing) performed prior to antibiotic treatment. Sinusitis was evident in 72% of the patients. Eye swab cultures indicated 80% had streptococcal, staphylococcal or enterococcal infection. The data indicate that sinusitis is an important cause of orbital cellulitis. The most common causative organisms were Streptococcus viridans (44%) and Staphylococcus aureus (32%). Initial antibiotics should therefore cover both organisms.
TI  - Activity of macrolides, lincosamines, streptogramins and fluoroquinolones against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci isolates from the western hemisphere: example of international surveillance (SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program )in the development of new drugs.
AB  - Resistance among commonly isolated Gram-positive cocci have compromised the available therapeutic regimens and require structured monitoring at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Two popular treatment classes of antimicrobials (macrolides-lincosamines-streptogramins [MLS], fluoroquinolones) have been tested against 3, 049 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance program. The strains were obtained from clinical cases in hospitals in the United States, Canada, and six nations (10 medical centers )in Latin America. MLS and fluoroquinolone compounds had moderate activity against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis only (gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin MIC(50), 0.5 microg/ml), and quinupristin/dalfopristin was potent only against E.faecium isolates (MIC(90), 1 microg/ml(-2) microg/ml). When tested against pneumococci, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90), < or = 1 microg/ml)were most active among the newer drugs, but vancomycin and clindamycinn inhibited > or =99.8% and 84.7% to 99.1% of strains, respectively. These results from a global resistance monitoring program should encourage rapid drug development. Based on in vitro sensitivity testing, they indicate a promising role for the treatment of emerging resistant Gram-positive cocci. The clinical role for each new agent will depend on safety profiles, rates of administration, and other issues identified during development in the clinical trials process.
TI  - Comparative killing rates of fluoroquinolones and cell wall-active agents.
AB  - Killing rates of fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and vancomycin were compared against Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The times required for fluoroquinolones to decrease viability by 3 log(10) were 1.5 h for Enterobacteriaceae, 4 to 6 h for staphylococci, and >/=6 h for streptococci and enterococci. Thus, the rate of killing by fluoroquinolones is organism group dependent; overall, they killed more rapidly than beta-lactams and vancomycin.
TI  - In vitro activities of LY333328 and comparative agents against nosocomial gram-positive pathogens collected in a 1997 global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY333328 was evaluated for 1,479 nosocomial gram-positive pathogens isolated in 12 countries during 1997. LY333328 MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 351), Enterococcus faecium (n = 100), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 593), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 325), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 110) were 1, 1, 2, 2, and 0.015 microg/ml, respectively. LY333328 demonstrated potent activity against isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Heterologous inducible expression of Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 aggregation substance asc10 in Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii contributes to cell hydrophobicity and adhesion to fibrin.
AB  - Aggregation substance proteins encoded by the sex pheromone plasmid family of Enterococcus faecalis have been shown previously to contribute to the formation of a stable mating complex between donor and recipient cells and have been implicated in the virulence of this increasingly important nosocomial pathogen. In an effort to characterize the protein further, prgB, the gene encoding the aggregation substance Asc10 on pCF10, was cloned in a vector containing the nisin-inducible nisA promoter and its two-component regulatory system. Expression of aggregation substance after nisin addition to cultures of E. faecalis and the heterologous bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii was demonstrated. Electron microscopy revealed that Asc10 was presented on the cell surfaces of E. faecalis and L. lactis but not on that of S. gordonii. The protein was also found in the cell culture supernatants of all three species. Characterization of Asc10 on the cell surfaces of E. faecalis and L. lactis revealed a significant increase in cell surface hydrophobicity upon expression of the protein. Heterologous expression of Asc10 on L. lactis also allowed the recognition of its binding ligand (EBS) on the enterococcal cell surface, as indicated by increased transfer of a conjugative transposon. We also found that adhesion of Asc10-expressing bacterial cells to fibrin was elevated, consistent with a role for the protein in the pathogenesis of enterococcal endocarditis. The data demonstrate that Asc10 expressed under the control of the nisA promoter in heterologous species will be an useful tool in the detailed characterization of this important enterococcal conjugation protein and virulence factor.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  - Mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The MICs were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. These concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. Mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. Mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. We identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine, quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. These had activities similar to that of mefloquine against S. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (MICs for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). They had activities similar to that of amphotericin B against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. Combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. The MIC and MBC of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. There was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. The compounds were rapidly bactericidal. They appear to act by disrupting cell membranes. Combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - [Acquired antibiotic resistance in Madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in Madagascar. Testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar in Antananarivo between October 1997 and October 1998. Antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. Results were read according to the criteria of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology. Preliminary findings documented a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin G and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of Staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which 80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of Escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of Shigella sp. respectively were resistant. Second-line antibiotics including penicillin M, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an effective alternative. Newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. Although not representative of Madagascar as a whole, the findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - The in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) and by determining kill-times. The MICs of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. The MIC was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. Even lower MIC values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for Haemophilus influenzae and for Candida tropicalis. MIC and MBC values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the MFC for C. tropicalis and C. albicans was much higher. Only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a MIC value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus showed MIC at 62.5 micrograms/ml. The MIC and MBC values among the isolates were comparable, while the MFC value for the yeasts was greater. A concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for S. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae and S. mutans and for Moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.
TI  - Rapid identification of bacteria in blood cultures by using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - The applicability of whole-cell hybridization for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood from septic patients was examined. Oligonucleotide probes, fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, directed against the variable regions of the 16S rRNAs of the following bacterial species and/or genera were used: Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Enterobacteriaceae family. A probe specific for the rRNAs of almost all bacteria and its complementary, reversed counterpart was used as positive and negative control, respectively. The probes were used in conjunction with a fast and simple-to-use protocol for whole-cell hybridization. This protocol yields an identification after 25 to 45 min, depending on whether the bacterium is gram positive or gram negative. A total of 182 blood samples which tested positive in a blood culture machine were investigated. All probes except for the ones for S. aureus and the CoNS showed sensitivities and specificities of 1.000. It was concluded that whole-cell hybridization is well suited for the fast screening of septic blood containing streptococci and/or enterococci or gram-negative rods.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. The combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus spp. The combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Legioniella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against E. faecalis. The combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. As for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against E. faecium. In patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or VREF infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. Emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with VREF infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. Systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. Myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. Venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. Hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and therefore has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. In serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. However, in VREF or unresponsive MRSA infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in England and Wales from 1990 to 1998. DESIGN: Description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. SETTING: Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and Poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates. RESULTS: There was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. The five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. No increase was seen in resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of camphorated chloroxylenol (ED 84) in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  - During and after chemomechanical preparation, particularly before the definitive  filling of an infected root canal, a temporary intracanal dressing with an antimicrobial activity is generally indicated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of ED 84, a liquid root canal disinfectant containing chloroxylenol (10%) and camphor (15%), against selected test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans) both in vitro and under clinical conditions, using extracted teeth. With a contact time of 180 min between undiluted ED 84 and the four bacterial suspensions in the canal, there was a 2 to 3 log reduction in the number of organisms. Under in vitro conditions, the reduction was even greater than 3 logs. When using a liquid medication as a temporary root canal dressing for a duration of approximately 2 days, ED 84 can definitely be used.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Quality control guidelines for disk diffusion and broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests with seven drugs for veterinary applications.
AB  - This multicenter study proposes antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC and disk diffusion methods) quality control (QC) parameters for seven compounds utilized in veterinary health. Alexomycin, apramycin, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were tested by broth microdilution against various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-recommended QC organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). In addition, disk diffusion zone diameter QC limits were determined for apramycin, enrofloxacin, and premafloxacin by using E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus ATCC 25923. The results from five or six participating laboratories produced >/=99.0% of MICs and >/=95.0% of the zone diameters within suggested guidelines. The NCCLS Subcommittee for Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing has recently approved these ranges for publication in the next M31 document.
TI  - Chromosomal integration of the green fluorescent protein gene in lactic acid bacteria and the survival of marked strains in human gut simulations.
AB  - An integration vector was constructed to allow introduction of the gfp gene into  the chromosomes of Gram-positive bacteria. Integration depends on homologous recombination between a short 458-nt sequence of the tet(M) gene in the vector and a copy of Tn916 in the host chromosome. Strains of Lactococcus lactis IL1403, Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, and Streptococcus gordonii DL1 stably marked with single chromosomal copies of the gfp were readily visualised by epifluorescence microscopy. The marked L. lactis strain survived poorly in a continuous culture system inoculated with human faecal flora, while the laboratory E. faecalis strain was lost at approximately the dilution rate of the fermenter.
TI  - Identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  - Aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. The results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. S. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and Enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. Other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pluranimalium, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus gallolyticus.
TI  - Characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  - The recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. During a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (EVA broth multiple tube test) used for Public Health purposes. The predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis (39%) and Ent. faecium (29%), followed by Ent. durans/hirae, Ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, Ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. Eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. Only one isolate was identified as belonging to the Streptococcus genus. The authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. This may help to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. All isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - High-level aminoglycoside resistance in the beta-hemolytic group G Streptococcus  isolate BM2721.
AB  - The beta-hemolytic group G Streptococcus clinical isolate BM2721 was resistant to high levels of aminoglycosides by synthesis of AAC(6')-APH(2"), APH(3')-III, and ANT(6) modifying enzymes. The corresponding genes were found to be adjacent as the result of a recombination event between Tn4001 and Tn5405, two transposons originating in staphylococci.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - An Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector as a tool for the construction of a group B Streptococcus heterologous mutant expressing the beta antigen (Bac) of the C protein complex.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) represent a very important group of human pathogens. So far little is known about the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause disease and the bacterial factors involved. One putative virulence factor is the beta antigen of the C protein complex (Bac), which can bind to the Fc region of human IgA. Its binding function might represent an important virulence mechanism. However, the genetic manipulation of this group of bacteria, necessary to prove involvement of bacterial factors in pathogenesis, is still in its infancy. We therefore tested the pAM401 vector system for its suitability in the construction of a heterologous expression mutant using the Bac protein as a model antigen. The bac gene, including its own promoter, was cloned into the Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401 and was stably maintained extrachromosomally in the bac-deficient GBS strain 335. Expression of Bac was assessed by extracting the protein from transformed 335(pPJTU1) cells, negative controls (335 wild-type, 335(pAM401)) and other Bac-expressing GBS strains (A909, LA239). Blots of the extracted proteins probed with IgA, polyclonal sera and a monoclonal antibody raised against Bac clearly revealed expression of the 130-kDa protein in the transformed GBS 335(pPJTU1) cells. The correct processing and surface anchoring of the expressed Bac was demonstrated by binding of (125)I-labelled IgA to whole cells. Strain 335(pPJTU1) bound 12 times as much IgA compared to the parental strain LA239 and the GBS 335 negative controls, and a total of 25% compared to the high-level-expressing strain A909. Our studies show that the pAM401 shuttle vector can be used for stable heterologous expression of surface proteins in GBS. Our strategy is also of major importance for the complementation of deletion mutants in GBS and other Gram-positive human pathogens to fulfill Koch's postulates. The Bac mutant constructed in this study, 335(pPJTU1), can be used in animal models to assess the importance of Bac in GBS pathogenesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some N-alkyl and N-nitrobenzyl substituted halides of (E)-4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxystilbazoles-4.
AB  - The synthesis of 11 new N-substituted derivatives of (E)-4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxystilbazoles-4 and their antimicrobial activity are reported. The relationships between structure and antibacterial activity are studied. In particular, compounds 5, 7 and 8 showed good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis, while compound 6 did so against S. aureus and S. faecalis.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 1: modifications of ring-C and pro-drugs.
AB  - A series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds with good bioavailability in vivo. These analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were O-glycosylated derivatives. They were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at MIC values of 7 microM. The results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. Amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (MIC 18 microM). The in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. Compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating human cell cultures, CH 2983, HeLa, and MG 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microM.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules. Four microorganisms, strains of ATCC (Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC-29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC-6633), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853)) and one mixture of these were used. These strains were inoculated in brain heart infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Sixty-three human maxillary central incisors were prepared and sterilized by autoclaving. Five groups of 12 teeth each were contaminated for 28 days using new 24-h cultures every 72 h, prepared and adjusted to tube 2 of the MacFarland scale (6 x 10(8) cells/ml). Root canals were then irrigated with 5 ml of saline, dried, and completely filled with calcium hydroxide paste. At intervals of 0, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, dressings were removed and teeth were immersed in 5 ml of BHI and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. Three uninoculated teeth were maintained in a humid environment as an aseptic control. These teeth were immersed in BHI and maintained at 37 degrees C for 7 days to determine microbial growth. Bacterial growth was shown by turbidity of the culture medium and confirmed by seeding these broths on BHI agar at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The positive BHI tubes were selected, and inoculum was spread on the surface of BHI agar, followed by the same incubation conditions. Gram stain was conducted from BHI growth and from colonies growing on solid medium. Calcium hydroxide in infected dentinal tubules showed no antimicrobial effect on S. faecalis, S. aureus, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, or on the bacterial mixture used throughout the experiment.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - Characterization of Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying Streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  - We have identified and characterized an Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (AP, encoded by phoZ). The predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from Bacillus subtilis. Expression of phoZ in Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), or Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (XP or BCIP). Two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. First, elimination of the signal sequence reduced AP activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. Restoration of export, using the signal sequence from C5a peptidase, restored AP activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. Second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which AP was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). In E. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher AP activity than the cytoplasmic fusion. We concluded that AP activity is export dependent. The signal sequence deletion mutant, phoZDeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from GBS that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. Included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the Rib protein (a cell wall protein from GBS) or with DppB (an integral membrane protein from GAS). AP acts as a reporter enzyme in GBS, GAS, and E. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - A variety of gram-positive bacteria carry mobile mef genes.
AB  - The mefE gene codes for a membrane bound efflux protein, which confers resistance to macrolides, and has been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae. A variety of gram-positive organisms were examined. Twenty-six isolates of S. pneumoniae carried mefE and were resistant to erythromycin (MIC of 2-16 mg/L). Two additional isolates of Emr S. pneumoniae carried both ermB and mefE(MIC of 16-128 mg/L). One Micrococcus luteus, one Corynebacterium jeikeium, three Corynebacterium spp., two viridans streptococci and seven Enterocccus spp. also carried mef genes. It was possible to move the mef gene from all 11 S. pneumoniae tested to susceptible S. pneumoniae and/or Enterococcus faecalis recipients. The addition of DNase (1 g/L) did not affect the gene transfer. It was also possible to move the mef gene from donor Enterococcus spp., viridans streptococci, M. luteus, C. jeikeium and Corynebacterium spp. to E. faecalis recipients. Transconjugant isolates were resistant to erythromycin (MIC = 16 mg/L). Hybridization with a labelled mef oligonucleotide probe against Southern blots and bacterial dot blots confirmed the presence of the mef genes. This is the first time that a mobile mef gene has been identified in four different genera, from three distinct geographical locations.
TI  - Interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  - Handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium, designated GUC, and here redesignated as GUCR, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. The vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the vanA cluster, to the chromosome of an E. faecalis recipient, JH2-2. Here it is reported that an earlier isolate of E. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium GUCR lacks the vanA gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by SmaI chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant GUCR. Therefore, "GUCS" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vanA cluster present in GUCR. Thirteen laboratory-generated vanA transconjugants derived from conjugation between GUCR and JH2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. Surprisingly, each JH2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. This pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. Transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) patterns largely consistent with that of JH2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. However, PFGE analysis showed that a large but variable amount of DNA, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. The mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new DNA is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. Mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, DNA fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. Sequencing of 16S ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. Sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rRNA operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rDNA operons was found. An apparent insertion sequence in E. faecium almost identical to IS 1485 and 57% sequence identity to IS 199 of Streptococcus mutans was found in the region of DNA transferred. The results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.
TI  - Bacterial complications of strongyloidiasis: Streptococcus bovis meningitis.
AB  - We report the case of a 64-year-old veteran who had Streptococcus bovis meningitis as a result of a long latent Strongyloides infection that became acute when he was treated with prednisone. We reviewed 38 reported cases of serious bacterial infections associated with strongyloidiasis. Patients most frequently had nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these 38 patients, 21 (55%) had meningitis, and 28 (73%) had bacteremia that was polymicrobial in 3 cases (8%). Other sites of infection included lung, bone marrow, ascites, mitral valve, and lymph node. Most infections were due to enteric gram-negative bacteria. There is one previously reported case of S bovis meningitis. Thirty-four of the patients (89%) were immunosuppressed; 21 of these (55%) were taking pharmacologic doses of adrenal corticosteroids. Thirty-three of the 38 (87%) patients died. Patients with enteric bacterial infection without an obvious cause should be tested for the presence of strongyloidiasis.
TI  - Cloning of insertion sequence IS1485 from Enterococcus species.
AB  - We have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, IS1485, that was present in  several members of the genus Enterococcus. IS1485 exists in varying copy numbers with at least 12 copies in E. durans (ATCC 11576), 3 copies in E. faecium (ATCC 19434), and one copy each in E. faecalis (ATCC 19433) and E. avium (ATCC 14024). It was also detected in clinical strains of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, and E. saccharolyticus. IS1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfA, orfB, and orfC. The largest, orfB, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfA; orfC is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfA. The genetic organization of IS1485 resembles that of members of the IS3 family of transposable elements. Sequence homology exists with several members of the IS3 family especially with IS199 from Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - alpha-Functionalized phosphonylphosphinates: synthesis and evaluation as transcarbamoylase inhibitors.
AB  - Diverse alpha-methyl-substituted phosphonylphosphinates (P-C-P-C-X) are accessible from a protected, pentafluorophenylsulfonated phosphonylphosphinate via nucleophilic displacement. The utility of this route is demonstrated with several nitrogen nucleophiles. The resulting amine and amino acid phosphonylphosphinate derivatives were evaluated as inhibitors of Streptococcus faecalis ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC). Compared with the structurally related phosphonoacetyl-L-ornithine (L-PALO), a known inhibitor of OTCs from various sources, the phosphonylphosphinates are surprisingly poor inhibitors, binding several orders of magnitude less tightly to the enzyme. These results suggest that the tetrahedral intermediate formed in the normal transcarbamoylase reaction is poorly mimicked by a tetrahedral and anionic phosphonate, either because of directly unfavorable interactions with a hydrogen-bond acceptor within the active site or because transition-state analogues are unable to induce the protein conformation changes that normally accompany reaction.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1996. The results were as follows: Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against MRSA. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. The carbapenems showed high activities against Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter cloacae. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of Serratia marcescens were detected. The antibacterial activity of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of CAZ, and there were some resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK between October 1996 and January 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the UK (ten Teaching, ten Associate Teaching and ten District General Hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between October 1996 and January 1997. High-level resistance (HLR) and low-level resistance (LLR) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. However, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (LLR range 0-15.4% and HLR range 0-30.8%). Considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. Using conventional MIC methodology, none of the isolates of S. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. However, eight isolates grew on Brain Heart Infusion Agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/L) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. With Enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vanA and three vanB phenotype).
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Str. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were included in the study. Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Each plate was incubated aerobically. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition. Saline was always ineffective. Decreased concentration of NaOCl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. Cresophene showed a significantly larger (P < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. Alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: 5.25% NaOCl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. A reduced concentration of NaOCl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. When compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of linezolid by two standard methods.
AB  - To determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, MICs and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy for 198 strains of gram-positive cocci. Zones were 4-5 mm larger by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method, but MICs did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method was used. This is because incubation in CO2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. Breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods.
TI  - Effects of a mixture of organisms, Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis on delta6-desaturase activity in the livers of rats fed a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet.
AB  - The effect of a mixture of organisms (a probiotic mixture) comprising Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Saccharomyces, and Candida (10(7-8) colony-forming units/g rice bran of each component) on delta6-desaturase activity in liver microsomes was compared with those of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecalis. There were four treatment groups. Each group of these rats received rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, L. acidophilus, or S. faecalis (30 g/kg) along with a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 wk. The serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at the end of the 4-wk feeding period (P<0.05). The proportion of palmitic acid in the serum phosphatidylcholine (PC) for the control group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of arachidonic acid in the serum PC for the mixed-organism group was also significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of arachidonic acid in the liver PC for the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the control and S. faecalis groups. The ratio of arachidonic acid/linoleic acid was significantly higher in the liver PC of rats fed the mixed organisms compared with the control group (P<0.05). The delta6-desaturase activity in the liver microsomal fraction of the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The delta6-desaturase activity correlated positively with the ratio of arachidonic acid/linoleic acid of liver PC, the correlation coefficient (r) being 0.819 (P<0.001). The results indicate that the effect of the mixture of organisms was to increase delta6-desaturase activity and serum arachidonic acid and decrease cholesterol compared to the other organisms and control, but the mechanism whereby the enzyme activity was related to serum cholesterol does not appear to have been explored.
TI  - Inducible or constitutive expression of resistance in clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci cross-resistant to erythromycin and lincomycin.
AB  - Thirty-five of 40 clinical isolates of enterococci and streptococci cross-resistant to erythromycin and lincomycin and harbouring erm genes were inducibly resistant to these drugs, suggesting that ribosomal methylation is predominantly inducibly expressed in these bacterial genera. Regulatory regions located upstream of the erm genes of four inducible and three constitutive strains were amplified and sequenced. Expression of constitutive resistance in two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis could be accounted for by a large deletion or a DNA duplication within the regulatory regions, respectively.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pIP823 from Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pIP823, which contains the dfrD gene; dfrD confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type S2. pIP823 possessed all the features of the pUB110/pC194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. The rep gene encoded a protein identical to RepU, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids pTB913 from a thermophilic Bacillus sp. and pUB110 from Staphylococcus aureus. The mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity with the Mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of pTB913 and pUB110. The host range of pIP823 was broad and included L. monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. In all these species, pIP823 replicated by generating single-stranded DNA and was stable. Conjugative mobilization of pIP823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis, between L. monocytogenes and E. coli, and between strains of E. coli, and by the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn1545 from L. monocytogenes to E. faecalis, and from L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis to E. coli. These data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. Our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in Listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.
TI  - Lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. The reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus, Propionibacterium acne and Streptococcus mutans. This extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.
TI  - Infective endocarditis: an epidemiological review of 128 episodes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the current epidemiology of infective  endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All microbiologically positive episodes of infective endocarditis treated at The University Hospital of Wales over a 9-year period from March 1987 to March 1996 was reviewed. Patients originated from the catchment area of The University Hospital of Wales or were referred from other hospitals in Wales. Data extraction was from records held in the Microbiology Department and, whenever possible, from patients' casenotes. The epidemiological parameters were: (1) age and sex of patients; (2) distribution of affected sites; (3) frequency of predisposing risk factors (cardiac and extracardiac); (4) incidence of early prosthetic valve endocarditis; and (5) mortality rates. RESULTS: There were 128 microbiologically positive episodes of endocarditis in 125 patients. The mean age of the population was 53.1 years and the aortic valve was the most frequently involved site of infection (51.6%). A presumed source of infection was identified in 20% if episodes. The commonest predisposing cardiac risk factor in native valve episodes was bicuspid aortic valve (16.7%) but there was no identifiable cardiac risk factor in a much larger proportion (37.7%) of native valve episodes. There was a low incidence (0.6%) of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis (12.3% and 24.5%) in this study. Viridans streptococci were the predominant organisms. In prosthetic valve episodes with onset after the 60th postoperative day but within one postoperative year the identity of the isolate suggested, in most cases, perioperative valve contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of infective endocarditis has undergone significant change. Inability to detect clinically common predisposing lesions, and the frequent absence of any identifiable predisposing cardiac risk factor mean that initial diagnosis is often difficult and demands a high index of suspicion. There was a low incidence of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and there were low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis; these figures suggest improvements in cardiac care. The microbiological evidence indicates that the duration of the postoperative time period used for classifying prosthetic valve endocarditis into 'early' and 'late' episodes should be extended from 60 days to 1 year.
TI  - Cell wall-anchored CshA polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in Streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  - It has been shown previously that inactivation of the cshA gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kDa) in the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii, generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral Actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. We now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) cells, bind CshA-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of cshA mutants. To more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of CshA, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire cshA gene into the replicative plasmid pAM401 and expressed full-length CshA polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. Enterococci expressing CshA exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell surface hydrophobicity over E. faecalis JH2-2 carrying the pAM401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. CshA expression in E. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind Actinomyces naeslundii cells. Electron micrographs of negatively stained E. faecalis cells expressing CshA showed peritrichous surface fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control E. faecalis JH2-2(pAM401) cells. The fibrils bound CshA-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of E. faecalis cells to fibronectin. The results demonstrate that the CshA polypeptide is the structural and functional component of S. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.
TI  - ClpE, a novel type of HSP100 ATPase, is part of the CtsR heat shock regulon of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Clp ATPases, which include the ubiquitous HSP100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. During the course of the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new member of the HSP100 family. We designated this protein ClpE, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the Clp ATPases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sakei and Clostridium acetobutylicum. A unique feature of these Hsp100-type Clp ATPases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. Unlike the other class III genes of B. subtilis (clpC and clpP ), clpE does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. Transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaA-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. Investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpE expression indicates that this gene is controlled by CtsR and is thus a member of the class III heat shock genes of B. subtilis. CtsR negatively regulates clpE expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five CtsR binding sites were identified through DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - An operon that confers UV resistance by evoking the SOS mutagenic response in streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae Rx1 is capable of repairing lesions caused by DNA-damaging agents in an error-free manner but lacks a UV-inducible error-prone repair system due to the absence of chromosomally encoded UmuDC-like proteins. We have identified an operon-like structure 8 kb from the left end of the pneumococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252 that confers SOS function in the host cells. DNA sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORFs). The deduced amino acid sequence of one of them, ORF13, which is capable of encoding a protein of 49.7 kDa, showed significant homology to UmuC, MucB, and other proteins involved in the SOS response. The carboxy-terminal region of another, ORF14, which is predicted to encode a 26-kDa polypeptide, shared similarity with UmuD- and MucA-like proteins that carry the amino acid residues recognized by the activated RecA* protein for proteolytic cleavage. The presence of plasmids carrying subcloned DNA from this region was found to restore UV-inducible mutagenic repair of chromosomal DNA in Escherichia coli cells defective in error-prone repair as well as in pneumococcus and Enterococcus faecalis UV202. Mutations within ORF13 abolished UV-induced mutagenesis but did not affect the conjugal transposition of the element.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common Gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of E. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC50 and MIC90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for both MRSA and MSSA; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for MRSE; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for MSSE; 0.125 microgram/mL and 0.125 microgram/mL for S. pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for S. pneumoniae. Eighty-two percent of the tested E. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an MIC50 of 2 micrograms/mL and an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/mL. Quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common Gram-positive bacteria other than E. faecalis in Taiwan.
TI  - Cation movements at alkaline pH in bacteria growing without respiration.
AB  - The respiratory chain has a central role in energy metabolism as a generator of a proton motive force in aerobic bacteria. In contrast, Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis), which lacks the respiratory chain, generates this proton gradient via a F-type H+ ATPase, but it works only at a pH below 8; no significant proton motive force is generated at a pH above 8. An Escherichia coli mutant deficient in both the respiratory chain and the H+ ATPase grew with a negligible proton motive force within the wide range of medium pH. It has been suggested that both E. hirae and E. coli are able to grow even when the cytoplasm is alkalinized beyond pH 8. These observations lead to the conclusion that bacteria can survive without operating cation transport systems driven by a proton motive force at alkaline pH. The activity of any transport system with optimum pH around neutrality should decline when both the outside and inside of cells are alkalinized. Thus, changes in transport systems as well as cellular metabolism may be essential for bacterial adaptation to changes in environmental pH.
TI  - Buffer effect on the kinetics of ornithine carbamyl transferase by HPLC.
AB  - A kinetic study of ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) from Streptococcus faecalis has been carried out, employing a new HPLC method based on the direct determination of citrulline. A different kinetic pattern was observed in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (TRIS) and triethanolamine (TEA) buffers: a ping-pong or an ordered sequential mechanism are suggested, respectively. The inhibition of Tris buffer on OCT reaction has also been demonstrated. The inhibition of Tris buffer on OCT reaction has also been demonstrated.
TI  - In vitro activities of two ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, were tested  by the agar dilution method against 280 strains of gram-positive bacteria with different antibiotic susceptibility profiles, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus spp. (group A streptococci, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci). Seventeen erythromycin-susceptible (EMs), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains were found to have HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs 4- to 16-fold lower than those of erythromycin (MIC at which 50% of isolates were inhibited [MIC50] [HMR 3647 and HMR 3004], 0.03 microgram/ml; range, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml; MIC50 [erythromycin], 0.25 microgram/ml; range, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml). All methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains tested were resistant to erythromycin and had HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs of > 64 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were slightly more active against E. faecalis than against E. faecium, and MICs for individual strains varied with erythromycin susceptibility. The MIC50s of HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 against Ems enterococci (MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and those enterococcal isolates with erythromycin MICs of 1 to 16 micrograms/ml were 0.015 microgram/ml. E. faecalis strains that had erythromycin MICs of 128 to > 512 micrograms/ml showed HMR 3647 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml and HMR 3004 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 64 micrograms/ml. In the group of E. faecium strains for which MICs of erythromycin were > or = 512 micrograms/ml, MICs of both ketolides were in the range of 1 to 64 micrograms/ml, with almost all isolates showing ketolide MICs of < or = 16 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were also more active than erythromycin against group A streptococci, group B streptococci, S. pneumoniae, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids. Time-kill studies showed bactericidal activity against one strain of S. aureus among the four strains tested. The increased activity of ketolides against gram-positive bacteria suggests that further study of these agents for possible efficacy against infections caused by these bacteria is warranted.
TI  - Humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: salivary secretory  immunoglobulin A antibodies reactive with Streptococcus mitis biovar 1, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis during the first two years of life.
AB  - Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and Streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer Streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium Enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. Low levels of salivary SIgA1 and SIgA2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even though S. mutans and E. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. Although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of SIgA between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of SIgA1 and SIgA2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. When the concentrations of SIgA1 and SIgA2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of SIgA1 and SIgA2 in saliva, SIgA1 and SIgA2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. Adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. Sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all SIgA antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the SIgA antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. The induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.
TI  - Antibacterial synergistic effect of chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide against Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Chlorhexidine (CHX) and Hydrogen peroxide (HP) are potent antibacterial agents that are used in controlling dental plaque. However, both agents bear undesired side-effects. We have tested the hypothesis that an antibacterial synergistic effect can occur between the two agents against Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. We have found that at several combinations of HP and CHX an antibacterial synergistic effect does occur, while at other combinations a on-significant synergism was noticed. No antagonism between the two agents was found in our experimental system. It can be postulated that the mechanism of this synergistic effect is via alteration of the bacterial cell-surface by CHX thereby allowing for an increased amount of HP to penetrate and to react with the intercellular organelles of the bacteria. These results suggest that CHX and HP can be of use in controlling the dental plaque in the oral cavity.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - Obturator internus muscle abscess in children: report of seven cases and review.
AB  - Obturator internus muscle (OIM) abscess is an uncommon entity often mistaken for  septic arthritis of the hip. We describe seven children with OIM abscess and review seven previously reported cases. The most common presenting symptoms were hip or thigh pain (14 patients), fever (13), and limp (13). The hip was flexed, abducted, and externally rotated in 11 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) were diagnostic for OIM abscess in the 14 patients. Associated abscesses were located in the obturator externus muscle (5 patients), psoas muscle (2), and iliac muscle (1). The etiologic agents were Staphylococcus aureus (8 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2), and Enterococcus faecalis (1). Three patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous drainage, and three had surgical drainage. Three patients had ischial osteomyelitis in addition to OIM abscess. The 11 children with uncomplicated OIM abscess were treated for a median of 28 days. All patients had an uneventful recovery.
TI  - Influence of different vehicles on the antibacterial effects of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - This study evaluated the influence of three different vehicles on the antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide against four bacterial species commonly found in endodontic infections. For this purpose, a broth dilution test using 24-well cell culture plates was performed. Results showed that all pastes were effective in killing the bacteria tested, but at different times. The calcium hydroxide/camphorated paramonochlorophenol/glycerin paste was the most effective against the four bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of the oxolinic acid--esculin--azide medium for the isolation and enumeration of faecal streptococci in a routine monitoring programme for bathing waters.
AB  - m-Enterococcus agar (m-Ent) has been generally considered the reference medium for faecal streptococci in bathing waters. However, it shows several shortcomings, and therefore it is important to test newly developed media that can guarantee more precise results. In this sense, the recently described oxolinic acid--esculin--azide agar medium (OAA) and m-enterococcus agar (m-Ent) were comparatively evaluated for the detection of faecal streptococci from seawater and fresh water. The OAA medium showed a significantly higher relative recovery percentage and specificity for both types of water than m-Ent. A similar spectrum of species was recorded from both media, Enterococcus faecium being predominant in fresh water and Enterococcus faecalis, in seawater. The superior performance of the OAA medium in both types of bathing waters, added to the fact that it does not require the use of complementary confirmative tests, makes this medium an excellent candidate to be employed for monitoring programmes.
TI  - [Estimation of probiotics by infection model of infant rabbit with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7].
AB  - We examined the preventative effect against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) infection in rabbits on administration of probiotics contained in Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus mesentericus. The probiotics were administered to 5 days old Japanese white rabbits throughout the experiment. Inoculation of 10(6) colony forming units (CFUs) of EHEC per rabbit was tried 8 days after birth. Three days after EHEC inoculation, in the control group (not administered probiotics), diarrhea was observed in approximately 80% of the rabbits, on the other hand, in the group administered probiotics, rabbits showed diarrhea in 15%. In necropsy, the number of EHEC in the contents of the cecum and the number of attaching and effacing (AE) lesions were fewer in the probiotics group than in the control group. These results suggest that infant rabbits are useful as a colitis model for EHEC, and the probiotics are effective for the prevention of the growth of EHEC in the intestine and for diarrhea.
TI  - Enzyme level of enterococcal F1Fo-ATPase is regulated by pH at the step of assembly.
AB  - The amount of F1Fo-ATPase in Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis) increases when the cytoplasmic pH is lowered below 7.6, and protons are extruded to maintain the cytoplasmic pH at around 7.6. In the present study, we found that the transcriptional activity of the F1Fo-ATPase operon was not regulated by pH. The synthesis of F1 subunits was increased 1.65 +/- 0.12-fold by the acidification of medium from pH 8.0 to pH 5.3. Western-blot analysis showed that there were F1 subunits in the cytoplasm, and the number of alpha plus beta subunits in the cytoplasm was 50% of the total number of the subunits in cells growing at pH 8.0. This decreased to 22% after shifting the medium pH to 5.3, with a concomitant 5.1-fold increase in the level of membrane-bound F1Fo-ATPase. The cytoplasmic F1 subunits were shown to be degraded, and Fo subunits not assembled into the intact F1Fo complex were suggested to be digested. These data suggest that regulation of the enzyme level of F1Fo-ATPase by the intracellular pH takes place mainly at the step of enzyme assembly from its subunits.
TI  - Hydration of linoleic acid by bacteria isolated from ruminants.
AB  - Two strains of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from the ovine rumen and known to hydrate oleic acid were shown to transform linoleic acid by hydration into two products. The products, identified as 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, were formed during stationary phase in yields of 13% and 6% respectively. Yields increased to 22% and 14% when culture conditions were optimised. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid production by bacteria. During a search for further linoleic-acid-hydrating bacteria, a strain of Streptococcus bovis isolated from bovine faeces and the ruminal strain S. bovis JB1 were found to hydrate linoleic acid. Both strains formed only one product and the most rapid appearance occurred during exponential growth. The S. bovis product, identified as 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, formed in a yield of 28%. This study provides the first information on linoleic acid hydration by ruminal bacteria.
TI  - Facile total synthesis and antimicrobial activity of the marine fatty acids (Z)-2-methoxy-5-hexadecenoic acid and (Z)-2-methoxy-6-hexadecenoic acid.
AB  - The total synthesis of the naturally occurring (Z)-2-methoxy-5-hexadecenoic acid  and (Z)-2-methoxy-6-hexadecenoic acid was accomplished using as a key step Mukaiyama's trimethylsilyl cyanide addition to 4- and 5-pentadecenal, respectively. These syntheses further confirm the structures of the natural marine fatty acids and corroborate their cis double-bond stereochemistry. The title compounds were antimicrobial against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0.35 micromol/mL) and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC 0.35 micromol/mL).
TI  - Infection-derived Enterococcus faecalis strains are enriched in esp, a gene encoding a novel surface protein.
AB  - We report the identification of a new cell wall-associated protein of Enterococcus faecalis. Studies on the distribution of the gene encoding this novel surface protein, Esp, reveal a significant (P < 0.001) enrichment in infection-derived E. faecalis isolates. Interestingly, the esp gene was not identified in any of 34 clinical E. faecium isolates or in 4 other less pathogenic enterococcal species tested. Analysis of the structural gene among various E. faecalis isolates reveals the existence of alternate forms of expression of the Esp protein. The deduced primary structure of the Esp protein from strain MMH594, inferred to be 1,873 amino acids (aa) with a predicted mass of approximately 202 kDa, reveals a core region consisting of repeat units that make up 50% of the protein. Esp bears global organizational similarity to the Rib and C alpha proteins of group B streptococci. Identity among Esp, Rib, and C alpha proteins is strikingly localized to a stretch of 13 aa within repeats of similar length. The high degree of conservation of this 13-residue sequence suggests that it plays an important role in the natural selection for this trait among infection-derived E. faecalis and group B streptococcal isolates.
TI  - Production of cholera toxin B subunit in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The intracellular expression of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was first achieved in Lactobacillus paracasei LbTGS1.4 with an expression cassette including the P25 promoter of Streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed L. pentosus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhD). Secretion of CTB was next attempted in L. paracasei LbTGS1.4 and L. plantarum NCIMB8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis Usp45 and PrtP, Enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and S. pyogenes M6 protein). Host-dependent secretion of CTB was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable CTB in the extracellular fraction of L. paracasei LbTGS1.4, secretion of CTB molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in L. plantarum NCIMB8826.
TI  - The presence of the tetO gene in a variety of tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes from Washington State.
AB  - Seventy tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested for the presence of tetracycline resistance genes, tetM and tetO, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. Seven isolates representing five serotypes (12, 22, 6A, 19F and 23) carried the tetO gene. Five of the isolates were genetically unrelated as judged using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Two 19F isolates came from the same patient, carried both tetM and tetO genes and had the same PFGE pattern. The other 63 isolates carried only the tetM gene. DNA sequences from three of the tetO-carrying isolates were determined; they showed 91-95% nucleotide sequence identity over 300 nucleotides, and 93-95% amino acid sequence identity over 100 amino acids. The isolates carrying both tetO and tetM genes could transfer the tetM gene into both Enterococcus faecalis and S. pneumoniae recipients, but not the tetO gene. There was no detectable transfer of the tetO gene, by conjugation, from the other five isolates.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes protein F promotes invasion of HeLa cells.
AB  - Although the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) has been considered an extracellular pathogen which adheres to human mucosal epithelium, the streptococcus possesses invasive capacity for cultured human epithelial cells. This study provides genetic and functional evidence supporting the conclusion that protein F is capable of mediating entry of S. pyogenes into HeLa cells. Using Tn916 insertion mutagenesis or an isogenic S. pyogenes strain with a defined mutation in the gene encoding protein F (prtF), it was observed that the invasive capacity was affected by the levels of surface-exposed protein F, but not by those of M protein. In addition, heterologous expression of protein F on Enterococcus faecalis conferred upon the bacteria an efficient invasive phenotype. Several assays demonstrated that both the fibronectin-binding domains of protein F, UR and RD2, were involved in host-cell invasion. In addition, coinfection experiments of HeLa cells with S. pyogenes and an Escherichia coli K-12 strain expressing an afimbrial adhesin AFA-I showed that the uptake of S. pyogenes did not permit internalization of the E. coli cells.
TI  - Septicaemia in an Austrian neonatal intensive care unit: a 7-year analysis.
AB  - The results of blood cultures and clinical data of 101 neonates with 110 episodes of septicaemia during a 7-y study period were reviewed. The overall incidence of culture-proven sepsis within the study period was 6.0 per 100 neonatal intensive care unit admissions and the mortality rate was 14%. Three groups of pathogens accounted for 70% of all isolates: coagulase-negative staphylococci (27%), aerobic Gram-negative rods (24%) and Enterococcus faecalis (19%). Group B streptococcus was the major pathogen of very early-onset septicaemia (within 24 h of birth), whereas late-onset infections were most commonly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Birthweight <1500 g, gestational age <30 weeks of gestation and early onset of symptoms within the first week of life were associated with poor prognosis. In addition, the case fatality rate of episodes caused by Gram-negative organisms was significantly higher than that of Gram-positive bacteraemia.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of OPC-20011, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic.
AB  - OPC-20011, a new parenteral 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic, has an oxygen atom at the  2- position of the cephalosporin frame. OPC-20011 had the best antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae: MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 6.25, 6.25, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Its activity is due to a high affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2' in MRSA, an affinity which was approximately 1,050 times as high as that for flomoxef. Against gram-negative bacteria, OPC-20011 also showed antibacterial activities similar to those of ceftazidime. The in vivo activities of OPC-20011 were comparable to or greater than those of reference compounds in murine models of systemic infection caused by gram-positive and -negative pathogens. OPC-20011 was up to 10 times as effective as vancomycin against MRSA infections in mice. This better in vivo efficacy is probably due to the bactericidal activity of OPC-20011, while vancomycin showed bacteriostatic activity against MRSA. OPC-20011 produced a significant decrease of viable counts in lung tissue at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight, an efficacy similar to that of ampicillin at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg on an experimental murine model of respiratory tract infection caused by non-ampicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae T-0005. The better therapeutic efficacy of OPC-20011 was considered to be due to its potent antibacterial activity and low affinity for serum proteins of experimental animals (29% in mice and 6.4% in rats).
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Evidence for a bacteriocin-like substance produced by a new strain of Streptococcus sp., inhibitory to gram-positive food-borne pathogens.
AB  - A new strain of Streptococcus sp. (CNCM I-841) isolated from a commercial probiotic product was shown to be antagonistic towards several food-borne pathogens including Clostridium sp. and Listeria monocytogenes. This strain produced and excreted an antibacterial substance in MRS broth. The inhibitory substance was different from hydrogen peroxide, since it was unaffected by catalase. It was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, indicating that the active moiety of the inhibitor was proteinaceous in nature, and it had no effect on its producer strain. These properties suggested that the inhibitory substance could be considered as a bacteriocin-like substance. The antimicrobial substance was also produced in M17 and tryptose broths if they were supplemented with Tween-80. Partial purification allowed a 10.5-fold increase in the specific activity. A preliminary characterization showed that it was active against lactobacilli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium sp. and Listeria sp. It was not affected by 2-h treatment at 60 degrees C, but was sensitive to treatments at 100 degrees C and to autoclaving at 121 degrees C. The activity was not affected by treatments at pH values ranging from 2 to 11.
TI  - European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey Study Group.
AB  - In the European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey 7078 Gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of Western Europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. Of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. Teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.5 microgram/mL) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL) and all but four to teicoplanin (MIC < or = 8 micrograms/mL); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL). With coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of MIC of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. Two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding Staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/mL teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/mL (resistant). Among isolates of S. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL) and 3.3% were resistant (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) to teicoplanin. However, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Generally, teicoplanin (mode MIC < or = 0.12 microgram/mL) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/mL) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. Glycopeptide-susceptible Enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.25 microgram/mL) than to vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL). Combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (VanA phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). Four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. Four isolates of E. faecium and four of E. faecalis expressed the VanB-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. Spain was the only country not to submit resistant E. faecium strains while resistant E. faecalis isolates came only from Spain and Italy.
TI  - Bacteriological activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The use of established fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, as  empirical therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe respiratory tract infections is limited by their poor activity against gram-positive and atypical pathogens. Data from in vitro susceptibility studies and in vivo animal protection models suggest that the new fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin offers equivalent activity against gram-negative pathogens and improved activity against gram-positive pathogens. In particular, susceptibility data indicate that trovafloxacin is at least 16-fold more potent than either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other susceptible pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. In vivo studies involving models of protection against acute systemic infection and pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, indicate that the antibacterial spectrum observed for trovafloxacin in vitro extends to the in vivo setting. Together, these findings suggest that trovafloxacin may offer clinical efficacy against respiratory pathogens superior to that of ciprofloxacin and of ofloxacin, and may find a useful role as empiric therapy in both the community and hospital setting.
TI  - Blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in Gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoZ) expression.
AB  - The process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. In such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous DNA. Although the lacZ system has been used extensively for this purpose in E. coli, analogous systems for use in Gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. We have developed a Gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoZ, to identify recombinant plasmids. To facilitate introduction of foreign DNA, a multiple cloning site (MCS) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoZ. Alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoZ gene (phoZMCS) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. The phoZMCS was transferred to pJS3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pDC123. In pDC123, phoZMCS was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetM and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pJS3. S. agalactiae (Group B streptococci, GBS), E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, S. gordonii, and E. coli containing pDC123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (X-p), which was readily distinguished from that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pJS3. Introduction of foreign DNA into the MCS of phoZMCS produced a white colonial phenotype in E. coli and GBS on agar containing X-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. We have used pDC123 to subclone the cpsE gene from the plasmid pCER111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the GBS capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. The plasmid pDC123 containing cpsE was isolated by direct electroporation into GBS strain A909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. This new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant DNA experiments in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vivo testing of an Enterococcus faecalis efaA mutant and use of efaA homologs  for species identification.
AB  - Disruption of the previously described efaA (from Enterococcus faecalis antigen A) gene was generated in E. faecalis strain OG1RF and loss of an 37-kDa immunoreactive band from the mutant was demonstrated in Western blots. In a mouse peritonitis model, mice infected with the efaAfs (fs=from Enterococcus faecalis) mutant showed more prolonged survival than mice infected with the parent strain OG1RF. These results suggest that efaAfs encodes a function important for infection of mice by enterococci. An efaA-like gene was also identified in E. faecium DNA libraries and its deduced amino acid sequence showed 73% similarity to EfaA of E. faecalis and 42-63% similarities to a group of streptococcal virulence and adhesion associated proteins that are components of ATP-binding cassette transport systems. Intragenic probes representing efaAfs, recAfs, efaAfm (fm=from E. faecium) and gyrAfm were tested for their ability to identify E. faecalis and E. faecium using colony lysates of 133 enterococci and one Streptococcus sp. Probes of E. faecium and E. faecalis origin hybridized to all isolates of E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively, regardless of their clinical source but not to any of 29 other enterococci. These results suggest that the use of gene probes may prove helpful in identification of isolates of E. faecium and E. faecalis.
TI  - Decontamination of drinking water by direct heating in solar panels.
AB  - A device was developed for direct heating of water by solar radiation in a flow-through system of copper pipes. An adjustable thermostat valve prevents water below the chosen temperature from being withdrawn. The results show that it is possible to eliminate coliform and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from naturally contaminated river water by heating to temperatures of 65 degrees C or above. Artificial additions of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli to contaminated river water were also inactivated after heating to 65 degrees C and above. The total viable count could be reduced by a factor of 1000. The heat-resistant bacteria isolated from the Mlalakuva River (Tanzania) were spore-forming bacteria which exhibited greater heat resistance than commonly used test bacteria originating from countries with colder climates. To provide a good safety margin it is recommended that an outlet water temperature of 75 degrees C be used. At that temperature the daily production was about 501 of decontaminated water per m2 of solar panel, an amount that could be doubled by using a heat exchanger to recycle the heat.
TI  - Binding properties of Streptococcus gordonii SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated SspA (1,542 amino acid residues) and SspB (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. These polypeptides are members of the antigen I/II family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as Actinomyces naeslundii. To determine if SspA and SspB have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspA and sspB genes were cloned into expression plasmid vector pTREX1-usp45LS to generate pTREX1-sspA and pTREX1-sspB, respectively, and the Ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface SspA or SspB polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen I/II polypeptide substrates. More than twice as many L. lactis cells expressing SspA bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (SAG) as did L. lactis cells expressing SspB. In contrast, lactococci expressing SspB adhered twice as well as lactococci producing SspA to collagen type I and to Candida albicans. The binding of A. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of Ssp polypeptides. L. lactis(pTREX1-sspB) cells bound in greater numbers to SAG than did Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells expressing SspB from pAM401EB-5. The results suggest that SspA and SspB have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by S. gordonii.
TI  - Piperazinyl oxazolidinone antibacterial agents containing a pyridine, diazene, or triazene heteroaromatic ring.
AB  - Oxazolidinones are a novel class of synthetic antibacterial agents active against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as selected anaerobic organisms. Important representatives of this class include the morpholine derivative linezolid 2, which is currently in phase III clinical trials, and the piperazine derivative eperezolid 3. As part of an investigation of the structure-activity relationships of structurally related oxazolidinones, we have prepared and evaluated the antibacterial properties of a series of piperazinyl oxazolidinones in which the distal nitrogen of the piperazinyl ring is substituted with a six-membered heteroaromatic ring. Compounds having MIC values </= 2 microg/mL vs selected gram-positive pathogens were discovered among each of the pyridine, pyridazine, and pyrimidine structural classes. Among these the cyanopyridine 17, the pyridazines 25 and 26, and the pyrimidine 31 exhibited in vivo potency vs S. aureus comparable to that of linezolid.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of endodontic irrigants on black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes and facultative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of endodontic irrigants was evaluated against four black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes and four facultative anaerobic bacteria by means of the agar diffusion test. All solutions used were inhibitory against all bacterial strains tested. A 4% NaOCl solution provided the largest average zone of bacterial inhibition of this study that was significantly superior when compared with the other solutions, except 2.5% NaOCl (p < 0.05). Based on the averages of the diameters of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition, the antibacterial effects of the solutions could be ranked from strongest to weakest as follows: 4% NaOCl; 2.5% NaOCl; 2% chlorhexidine; 0.2% chlorhexidine, EDTA, and citric acid; and 0.5% NaOCl.
TI  - An immunoassay for the detection and quantitative determination of mycothiol.
AB  - Mycothiol (MSH) is a glycosylated derivative of N-acetylcysteine that may have antioxidant functions in mycobacteria and other actinomycetes. To develop a highly specific assay for MSH, we capitalized on the selective binding of thiols to a maleimide residue linked to bovine serum albumin and employed affinity-purified polyclonal antibody and an enzyme-linked secondary antibody for detection. The assay was shown to be specific and to detect MSH at levels as low as 0.1 pmol when conducted in the form of a microtiter plate-based ELISA. A similar, nitrocellulose membrane-based immunoassay was shown to be useful for qualitative detection of MSH-producing bacterial colonies.
TI  - Use of the lactococcal nisA promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  - We characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisA promoter in strains of the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. nisA promoter activity was dependent on the proteins NisR and NisK, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the extracellular inducer nisin. The nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. Significant induction of the nisA promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is inhibited. The efficiency of the nisA promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the Spac, xylA, and lacA promoters in B. subtilis and in S. pyogenes. Because nisA promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.
TI  - Comparison of NNA agar culture and selective broth culture for detection of group B streptococcal colonization in women.
AB  - In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the use of a  selective broth culture for the improved detection of genital tract or anorectal carriage of group B streptococci (GBS) in pregnant women. In order to verify this recommendation in our laboratory, we compared the sensitivity of Todd-Hewitt medium with gentamicin and nalidixic acid (SBM) with our current method of direct plating on blood agar medium containing neomycin and nalidixic acid (NNA). Five hundred consecutive cervicovaginal and anorectal specimens submitted for GBS culture were included in the study. Swabs were plated onto NNA and the swabs were immersed in SBM, followed by overnight incubation at 35 degrees C. On the following day, the NNA plates were examined for colonies typical of GBS and the organisms were identified by the CAMP test or by latex agglutination. SBM cultures were subcultured onto blood agar and CNA agar plates, and the plates were reincubated for 24 h. Negative specimens from either medium were incubated for an additional 24 h and were examined again before finalization of the results. GBS were recovered from 78 specimens by both methods; from SBM only for 17 specimens (sensitivity, 86%) and from NNA only for 16 specimens (sensitivity, 85%). A moderate to heavy growth of Enterococcus faecalis was observed on plates containing NNA-positive, SBM-negative specimens. Competitive growth studies suggested that E. faecalis suppressed the growth potential of GBS in SBM. Our study suggests that direct plating on NNA, as a single method, is equivalent in sensitivity to SBM for the recovery of GBS, and the results are often available 24 h sooner. However, it appears that both direct plating and selective broth amplification techniques are required for the maximum level of identification of colonization with GBS in pregnant women.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500, Synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the United States and Canada.
AB  - A total of 200 medical center laboratories in the USA and Canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly RP 59500 or Synercid), against 28,029 Gram-positive cocci. Standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. Remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at MICs of > or = 2 micrograms/mL). The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus was 0.5 microgram/mL and 1 microgram/mL, respectively. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 1 microgram/mL, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. Other Enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL) or vancomycin (86 to 95%; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL). Among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 (0.75 microgram/mL) for 4,626 tested Streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. When five regions in the USA and Canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the Farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible E. faecium. Canadian strains were generally more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested against E. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). The U.S. Southeast region had S. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among E. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. The Northeast region of the USA had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. Strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (MICs, > or = 4 micrograms/mL) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of E. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. The most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. Overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major Gram-positive pathogens in North America, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.
TI  - A new ketolide, HMR 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  - HMR 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. The effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance was tested in a lacZ reporter system under control of several ermAM-like attenuator variants. For one constitutively resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacZ were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pJIM2246 and the plasmid was introduced into Staphylococcus aureus RN4220. For the wild-type attenuators, HMR 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart RU 6652 and erythromycin. As expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant S. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. For one S. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermAM methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced. For streptococci, the activity of HMR 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. The weak inducer activity of HMR 3004 explained its activity against inducibly MLSB-resistant S. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant E. faecalis.
TI  - Characterization of the haemolytic activity of Streptococcus equi.
AB  - The haemolytic activity of Streptococcus equi, the cause of equine strangles, was characterized. Production of haemolysin in Todd Hewitt broth was dependent on an equine serum supplement and the logarithmic phase of growth after which activity declined sharply. RNA core also induced haemolysin production from cells harvested at the end of the logarithmic phase of growth. Haemolysis was not affected by cholesterol, was only slightly increased in reducing conditions and was completely inactivated by trypan blue, identifying the haemolytic activity as streptolysin S-like (SLS-like). Purification by hydroxyapatite and Sephacryl column chromatography yielded proteins of molecular weights of approximately 6000 and 17 000-22 000 Da with a 64-fold increase in specific activity. Low molecular weight proteins from the RNA core were still present in the purified toxin. Two non-haemolytic mutants were derived by conjugation with an Enterococcus faecalis-carrying transposon Tn916. Southern blots of HindIII digests of DNA revealed that one of the mutants contained three transposon insertions and the other just one. A lambda phage library of S. equi contained plaques whose haemolytic activity was enhanced by reducing conditions and inhibited by cholesterol, suggesting a streptolysin O-like (SLO-like) activity. However, haemolysin in culture sonicates of host E. coli in which the lambda phage insert was subcloned into plasmid (pUC18), was not affected by these conditions. Seven isolates of S. equi in medium without SLS-like inducers showed no SLO-like activity and no evidence for an SLO-like toxin could be found by immunoblotting with pneumolysin antiserum and monoclonal antibodies or by polymerase chain reaction with primers derived from sequences conserved between the SLO genes of Lancefield group A, C and G streptococci. S. equi does not appear to possess a streptolysin O but does make a streptolysin S-like toxin whose production can be interrupted at just one genetic locus.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: an ecological approach to a growing threat.
AB  
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. We examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates. The test strains represented a large variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of DNA fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), MRSA strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. In the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/L (S. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/L (in MRSA and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. Nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. Serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/L) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the MIC increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/L and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 752 bacterial strains were isolated in 10 hospitals during the period from June, 1996 through May, 1997. 1. Distribution of age and sex of patients and type of infections. Among males, those with ages 40 years or older were more frequent, the higher the ages of them. Among females, those with ages in the 60's were the most frequent (24.6%), and those with ages in the 20's, 40's and 50's were about 13%. With regard to type of infections, more than a half of infections among males with ages 30 years or older were of complicated types, but most of infections among females were of uncomplicated types, especially among females of ages less than 60 years. 2. Ages of patients and types of pathogens. The higher the ages of patients, the lesser became the isolation frequencies of Escherichia coli, but the higher were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. 3. Effect of antibiotic use on isolation frequencies of pathogens. Use of antibiotics decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically (231 isolates before antibiotics compared to 60 after). Even isolated pathogens from patients with complicated UTIs decreased drastically with the use of antibiotics when indwelling catheters were not in use (193 isolates before antibiotics compared to 75 after), but when indwelling catheters were in use, antibiotics apparently failed to decrease the isolation frequency. 4. Surgical procedures and types of causative organisms for UTIs. From cases of uncomplicated UTIs, E. coli was the most frequently isolated, followed by Enterococcus Faecalis and Klebsiella spp. E. coli was the most frequently isolated organism from complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. When a surgical procedures were not done, E. coli was isolated most frequently. From cases of complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and E. faecalis were the organisms that were mainly isolated, with isolation frequencies of 23.2%, 15.2, 12.2, respectively. When no surgical procedures were used, isolation frequencies of P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis and Enterobacter spp. were 17.2%, 13.8%, 13.8%, respectively.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Bacterial flora in the duodenum of healthy cats, and effect of dietary supplementation with fructo-oligosaccharides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in the duodenal flora of healthy cats over time, and evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). ANIMALS: 12 healthy, barrier-maintained, specific-pathogen-free cats. PROCEDURE: Duodenal juice for bacteriologic examination was collected via oral endoscopy 5 times from each cat over a 32-week period. Cats were allotted randomly to 2 groups, and a crossover design study, during which they were fed either a replete dry (basal) diet or, for 12 consecutive weeks, basal diet supplemented with 0.75% FOS, was done. Samples (3 from cats fed the basal and 2 from cats fed the FOS diet) were collected for a minimum of 6 weeks after commencement of feeding, and a minimum of 6 weeks apart. RESULTS: Mean aerobic, anaerobic, and total bacterial counts did not differ significantly among sample collection times. After pooling of the results, mean (+/- SD) log10 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerobic, anaerobic, and total bacteria/ml were 5.5 +/- 1.1, 4.8 +/- 1.0 and 5.6 +/- 1.1, respectively. However, individual cats had considerable variation in counts: mean (range) intraindividual coefficients of variation were: 19.0 (6.1 to 34.2), 19.9 (4.8 to 35.5), and 18.1 (5.5 to 32.6)%, respectively. In 1 cat, total bacterial count varied between < 3.0 and 6.3 CFU/ml. Bacterial flora varied qualitatively: only Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides, Pasteurella, and Streptococcus spp, and unidentified gram-negative (aerobic) rods were present in > 50% of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Wide quantitative and qualitative variation in the duodenal flora of healthy cats was observed over time, which was not affected by dietary supplementation with FOS.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY333328 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We report the activity of LY333328 against 35 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including organisms carrying the vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes, as determined by PCR), 33 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 29 clinical isolates of high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. All isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/mL LY333328, and 8 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all isolates tested. All isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were inhibited by 1 microgram/mL LY333328, and 4 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates tested. All isolates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were inhibited by < 0.125 microgram/mL LY333328, and 0.25 microgram/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all S. pneumoniae isolates tested. LY333328 is a promising new glycopeptide antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [Infective endocarditis--a review of 21 cases in last 10 years].
AB  - Twenty one cases of infective endocarditis in last 10 years were re-evaluated by  Duke's criteria. Fourteen strains of Streptococcus viridans, 4 of Enterococcus faecalis, 1 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were isolated from blood culture. As to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 strains of Streptococci, imipenem revealed the lowest MIC value, following penicillin G, ceftriaxon not equal to ampicillin, vancomycin and gentamicin. One strain of them was penicillin-resistant (0.8 micrograms/ml). Serum inhibitory test (SIT) and serum bactericidal test (SBT) were undergone for 6 cases. The assay was efficient to determine penicillin-tolerance of causative bacterium. Vegetations were observed in 18 cases of 21 by the echo-cardiography, especially transesophageal echocardiography had better diagnostic sensitivity compared to transthoracic echocardiography. However, it took 12 weeks from the first febrile episode to achieve definite diagnosis. One of reasons to take such a long time to reach diagnosis was that major causative organism was S. sanguis, whose inflammatory reaction to the host was said to be strikingly weak.
TI  - Attachment of group B streptococci to macrophages is mediated by a 21-kDa protein.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is able to bind to human macrophages in vitro in the  absence of exogenous opsonins. The exact mechanisms that mediate this attachment are unclear. This study was undertaken to determine what protein adhesins are present on the surface of GBS that mediate attachment to macrophages. We have identified a 21-kDa protein from the envelope of GBS type III that directly binds to macrophages as determined by Western blot analysis. Antiserum against this protein was able to inhibit binding of GBS to macrophages by greater than 80% as measured by flow cytometry. Antiserum against the 21-kDa protein cross-reacted with 21-kDa proteins from GBS type Ib, type II, type III (COH31 and MR732) and type IV, as well as Staphyloccus epidermidis, but not GBS type Ia, Listeria monocytogenes or Enterococcus faecalis. This protein may be important in mediating the attachment of GBS to macrophages in an opsonin-poor environment.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Reduced virulence of group A streptococcal Tn916 mutants that do not produce streptolysin S.
AB  - Streptolysin S (SLS) is a potent cytolytic toxin produced by nearly all group A streptococci (GAS). SLS-deficient Tn916 insertional mutants were generated from two clinical isolates of GAS, MGAS166s and T18Ps (M serotypes 1 and 18, respectively), by transposon mutagenesis using Tn916 donor strain Enterococcus faecalis CG110. Representative nonhemolytic transconjugants SBNH5 and SB30-2 each harbored a single Tn916 insertion in identical loci. The insertion in SBNH5 was located in the promoter region of an open reading frame, designated sagA, rendering it transcriptionally inactive. Protease, streptolysin O, and DNase activities and the production of M protein remained the same in the nonhemolytic mutants and the wild-type strains, as did the growth rates and exoprotein profiles. Transconjugants were evaluated in an established murine model by injecting the organisms subcutaneously and monitoring the mice for alterations in weight and the development of necrotic lesions. Animals infected with SBNH5, compared to those infected with MGAS166s, gained weight during the first 24 h (+1.15 versus -1.16 g; P < 0.05) and had fewer necrotic lesions (0 versus 7; P = 0.0007). Animals infected with SB30-2, compared to those infected with T18Ps, also gained weight within the first 24 h (+0.54 versus -0.66 g; P < 0.05) and produced fewer necrotic lesions (1 versus 8; P = 0.001). Revertants of the mutants in which Tn916 had been excised regained the hemolytic phenotype and the virulence profile of the wild-type strains. This study demonstrates that SLS-deficient mutants of GAS, belonging to different M serotypes and containing identical Tn916 mutations, are markedly less virulent than their isogenic parents.
TI  - Immunoreactivity of five monoclonal antibodies against the 37-kilodalton common cell wall protein (PsaA) of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced against the Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) 37-kDa common cell wall protein. These antibodies were used in a dot immunoblot and Western blot study of clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae to detect the presence of the protein. By both assays, the MAbs reacted with clinical isolates representing the 23 type-specific serotypes present in the licensed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a protein migrating in the gel with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. An extension of the study by using dot immunoblot analysis that included an analysis of the 90 serotypes of S. pneumoniae showed that all five MAbs reacted with 89 of the 90 serotypes tested. MAb 1B6, the exception, did not react with S. pneumoniae serotype 16F. Dot immunoblot analysis of the MAbs with Enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci showed varied reactivity patterns, depending on the species. The MAbs against the 37-kDa antigen did not react with Escherichia coli, respiratory pathogens, or nonpathogens representing 22 genera and 29 species of bacteria. All five MAbs also reacted with five multidrug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. In summary, these MAbs may be useful for detection of pneumococcal antigen and may lead to the development of diagnostic assays for pneumococcal disease.
TI  - Import and metabolism of glutathione by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Glutathione (gamma-GluCysGly, GSH) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including Streptococcus mutans ATCC 33402, import it from their growth medium. Import of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) by S. mutans 33402 in 7H9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent Km of 18+/-5 microM. GSSG, GSH, S-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hCySSG) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-GluCys. In contrast, the disulfide of CysGly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-Glu residue is important for efficient transport. During incubation with GSSG, little GSSG was detected in cells but GSH and gamma-GluCys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. No significant intracellular accumulation of Cys or sulfide was found. Transient intracellular accumulation of D/L-homocysteine, as well as GSH and gamma-GluCys, was observed during import of hCySSG. Although substantial levels of GSH were found in cells when S. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such GSH accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. However, the presence of cellular GSH did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. Import of glutathione by S. mutans ATCC 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (S. agalactiae ATCC 12927, S. pyogenes ATCC 8668, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.
TI  - Discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  - A 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. Antibacterial assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli imp- and a Candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. Screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position A (secondary amine), at the end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. Subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. The range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting the first-round active sublibraries. Pyridinopolyamine positions B (secondary benzylamine) and C (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. High-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18, and 21 with MICs of 1-5 microM against S. pyogenes and E. coli imp-. Using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position C and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position B with position D (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. Subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier II panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, S. pyogenes, S. pyogenes (wild-type), Streptomyces aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at MICs of 1-12 microM, whereas MICs for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were > 100 microM. These eight compounds were not active (> 100 microM) against fungus C. albicans.
TI  - A broad-host-range mobilizable shuttle vector for the construction of transcriptional fusions to beta-galactosidase in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A low-copy-number vector designated pTCV-lac has been constructed to provide a convenient system to analyze regulatory elements in Gram-positive bacteria. The main components of this vector are: (i) the origins of replication of pACYC184 and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1, (ii) erythromycin- and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2, and (iv) a promoterless beta-galactosidase-encoding lacZ gene with a Gram-positive ribosome binding site. This 12 kb plasmid is present in Gram-positive hosts in three to five copies per chromosome equivalent and contains three unique cloning sites (EcoRI, SmaI, BamHI) for cloning of DNA inserts upstream of the lacZ gene. Plasmid pTCV-lac and derivatives carrying different promoter fragments have been transferred by conjugation from an Escherichia coli IncP mobilizing donor strain to Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. These plasmids were structurally stable in these hosts and the corresponding promoter activities, quantitated by the determination of the beta-galactosidase specific activities, were found to cover at least a 100-fold range in beta-galactosidase values. These results indicate that pTCV-lac should be useful for analysis of gene regulation in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. Baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the Mann-Whitney test. Most of the 40 species tested, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. Prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of Streptococcus species, particularly Streptococcus constellatus. The odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if S. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the total DNA probe count. Since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using DNA probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized subgingival species. The remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences. Many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as Acinetobacter baumanni, Gemella haemolysans, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera Bartonella, Ralstonia, Neisseria, Eubacterium, Rothia, Gordona, Gemella, Corynebacterium, Leptotrichia, and Actinomyces. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. As a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of S. constellatus were found.
TI  - The challenge of antibiotic resistance.
AB  
TI  - Acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  - Using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the pH-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results in enhanced survival at low pH. The lower pH limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of Neisseria A182 at pH 6.34; growth of Lactobacillus casei RB1014 stopped at pH 3.81, with species of Actinomyces, Enterococcus, Prevotella and Streptococcus falling between these limits. The working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher pH limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. Adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal pH would trigger the induction of a mechanism that would enhance survival at a pH killing pH 7.5 control cells. The killing pH varied from pH 4.5 for Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 to pH 2.3 for the three Lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three Streptococcus mutans strains killed at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal pH values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the pH list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two pH values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at pH values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at pH 7.5. Predominant among the latter group were the S. mutans and Lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive response exhibited by S. mutans LT11 and S. mutans Ingbritt, involving a process that required protein synthesis. Time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering pH before the acid response was fully functional. These results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as Enterococcus faecalis, to pH values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below pH 3.5.
TI  - Repetitive sequence-based PCR versus pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for typing  of Enterococcus faecalis at the subspecies level.
AB  - Repetitive sequence-based PCR was compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for the ability to discriminate Enterococcus faecalis isolates at the subspecies level. The BOXA2R primer, derived from repetitive sequences in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was applied to 41 isolates of E. faecalis collected from various sources. The REP1R-Dt and REP2-Dt primers, derived from the gram-negative repetitive extragenic palindromic element, were also applied to 18 selected isolates. Of the 41 isolates examined, 7 were beta-lactamase producing and 8 were vancomycin resistant. By PFGE, 17 isolates had distinct patterns; the other 24 were classified into eight different clonal groups. By PCR using the BOXA2R primer, 16 isolates generated distinct patterns; the other 25 were classified into nine different clonal groups. There were only minor differences in the PCR results obtained by using the BOXA2R primer and the REP1R-Dt and REP2-Dt primers. Two isolates among vancomycin-resistant enterococci from the greater Houston, Tex., area were related by PFGE, distinct by PCR with the BOXA2R primer, and related by PCR with the REP1R-Dt and REP2-Dt primers. Clonal relationships among the remaining 39 isolates were similar by both PFGE and PCR. PCR reliably discriminated all epidemiologically unrelated isolates. Although PCR is less time consuming than PFGE, PCR results were more difficult to interpret than PFGE results, perhaps because fewer bands were generated by PCR than by PFGE and some PCR products were inconsistently seen.
TI  - Molecular mechanism of peptide-specific pheromone signaling in Enterococcus faecalis: functions of pheromone receptor TraA and pheromone-binding protein TraC encoded by plasmid pPD1.
AB  - Conjugative transfer of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pPD1 is activated by cPD1, one of several peptide sex pheromones secreted by plasmid-free recipient cells, and is blocked by a donor-produced peptide inhibitor, iPD1. Using a tritiated pheromone, [3H]cPD1, we investigated how pPD1-harboring donor cells receive these peptide signals. Donor cells rapidly incorporated [3H]cPD1. The cell extract but not the membrane fraction of the donor strain exhibited significant [3H]cPD1-binding activity. On the basis of these data and those of tracer studies, it was demonstrated that cPD1 was internalized, where it bound to a high-molecular-weight compound. The cell extract of a strain carrying the traA-bearing multicopy plasmid (pDLHH21) also exhibited high [3H]cPD1-binding activity. A recombinant TraA exhibited a dissociation constant of 0.49 +/- 0.08 nM against [3H]cPD1. iPD1 competitively inhibited [3H]cPD1 binding to TraA, whereas pheromones and inhibitors relating to other plasmid systems did not. These results show that TraA is a specific intracellular receptor for cPD1 and that iPD1 acts as an antagonist for TraA. A strain carrying the traC-bearing multicopy plasmid (pDLES23) exhibited significant [3H]cPD1-binding activity. A strain carrying traC-disrupted pPD1 (pAM351CM) exhibited lower [3H] cPD1-binding activity as well as lower sensitivity to cPD1 than a wild-type donor strain. Some of the other pheromones and inhibitors inhibited [3H]cPD1 binding to the traC transformant like cPD1 and iPD1 did. These results show that TraC, as an extracellular less-specific pheromone-binding protein, supports donor cells to receive cPD1.
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Cloning and genetic and sequence analyses of the bacteriocin 21 determinant encoded on the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pPD1.
AB  - The pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pPD1 (59 kb) of Enterococcus faecalis encodes the bacteriocin 21 (bac21) determinant. Cloning, transposon insertion mutagenesis and sequence analysis of the bac21 determinant showed that an 8.5-kb fragment lying between kb 27.1 and 35.6 of the pPD1 map is required for complete expression of the bacteriocin. The 8.5-kb fragment contained nine open reading frames (ORFs), bacA to bac1, which were oriented in the same (upstream-to-downstream) direction. Transposon insertions into the bacA to bacE ORFs, which are located in the proximal half of bac21, resulted in defective bacteriocin expression. Insertions into the bacF to bac1 ORFs, which are located in the distal half of bac21, resulted in reduced bacteriocin expression. Deletion mutant analysis of the cloned 8.5-kb fragment revealed that the deletion of segments between kb 31.6 and 35.6 of the pPD1 map, which contained the distal region of the determinant encoding bacF to bac1, resulted in reduced bacteriocin expression. The smallest fragment (4.5 kb) retaining some degree of bacteriocin expression contained the bacA to bacE sequences located in the proximal half of the determinant. The cloned fragment encoding the 4.5-kb proximal region and a Tn916 insertion mutant into pPD1 bacB trans-complemented intracellularly to give complete expression of the bacteriocin. bacA encoded a 105-residue sequence with a molecular mass of 11.1 kDa. The deduced BacA protein showed 100% homology to the broad-spectrum antibiotic peptide AS-48, which is encoded on the E. faecalis conjugative plasmid pMB2 (58 kb). bacH encoded a 195-residue sequence with a molecular mass of 21.9 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant homology to the C-terminal region of HlyB (31.1% identical residues), a protein located in the Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin operon that is a representative bacterial ATP-binding cassette export protein.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - Isolation and overexpression of a gene encoding an extracellular beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 was found to produce a 25-kDa extracellular enzyme active against beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucans. A gene was isolated encoding a specific beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase that corresponds to this size and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 16. A 4- to 10-fold increase in supernatant beta-glucanase activity was obtained when the cloned beta-glucanase gene was reintroduced into S. bovis JB1 by use of constructs based on the plasmid vector pTRW10 or pIL253. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase gene was also expressed upon introduction of the pTRW10 construct pTRWL1R into Lactococcus lactis IL2661 and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, although extracellular activity was 8- to 50-fold lower than that in S. bovis JB1. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase purified from the culture supernatant of S. bovis JB1 carrying pTRWL1R showed a K(m) of 2.8 mg per ml and a Vmax of 338 mumol of glucose equivalents per min per mg of protein with barley beta-glucan as the substrate. The S. bovis beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase may contribute to the ability of this bacterium to utilize starch by degrading structural polysaccharides present in endosperm cell walls.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a C-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of CFC-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. CFC-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. CFC-222 was particularly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.2 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.39 microg/ml). Against Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (MIC90s for E. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). The in vitro activity of CFC-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence of horse serum. However, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. The in vivo protective efficacy of CFC-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by S. aureus. CFC-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this infection model, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.
TI  - Successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. It has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. The efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. Vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to MRSA and E. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to S. oralis. Rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of each strain. Rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of S. oralis (ampicillin group) or E. faecium and MRSA (vancomycin group). All rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. Teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with E. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with MRSA by 100 and 92%, respectively. Teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with S. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. Prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-MICs. It is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.
TI  - A computerised system for the identification of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A generic computerised system for the identification of bacteria was developed. The system is equipped with a key to the identification of lactic acid bacteria. The identification is carried out in two steps. The first step distinguishes groups of bacteria by following a decision tree with general identification tests. The second step in the identification is the distinction of species within a group on the basis of biochemical fermentation patterns. During grouping, probabilities for test failure are used. These probabilities can be used for assessing the quality of a given test answer. The probabilities are also used to select the most probable test answer in cases where the test result is inconclusive. The probabilities of test failure were determined by a group of experts and a group of potential users of the identification system. During species identification, similarity indices are calculated for all bacteria in a group. The described identification system has the ability to "learn" from different sessions in the species identification step, improving both identification speed and accuracy. Because of the versatile way in which the system is set up, it can very easily be expanded with identification keys to other organisms.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic Gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of Gram-positive bone infections, METHODS: Vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. The 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma levels between 25 and 35 mg/L. Mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. Sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). Sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were performed at the beginning of the treatment. Involved bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), S. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), Enterococcus faecalis (one), Enterococcus avium (one) and Streptococcus bovis (one). RESULTS: MIC of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L. The mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/L. Based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). Failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). Adverse events included pruritus (four cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and transient neutropenia (two). Vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of Gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material removal are performed.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Serum inhibitory titers and serum bactericidal titers for human subjects receiving multiple doses of the antibacterial oxazolidinones eperezolid and linezolid.
AB  - In Phase I trials subjects received multiple doses of eperezolid (PNU-100592; formerly U-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766; formerly U-100766), and steady-state samples were drawn at the projected peak and trough timepoints. Serum inhibitory titer and serum bactericidal titer values were determined using single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Serum inhibitory titer values generally correlated with drug concentration in serum and inherent organism susceptibility. Against S. aureus and E. faecalis sera from patients dosed with either drug were generally inhibitory at the peak timepoint, but at trough only linezolid exhibited a persistent effect. No bactericidal activity was seen for either drug against S. aureus or E. faecalis. The sera from patients dosed with either drug exhibited inhibition of S. pneumoniae at peak and trough. Bactericidal activity was seen against S. pneumoniae for both drugs at peak time and at trough for many of the sera for patients on the higher dose regimens. The results demonstrated that the sera from most human subjects dosed with eperezolid or linezolid were inhibitory to S. aureus and E. faecalis and S. pneumoniae and that many of the samples exhibited bactericidal activity for S. pneumoniae.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and MIC quality control guidelines of RPR 106972  (RPR 112808/RPR106950): a novel orally administered streptogramin combination. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - RPR 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against Gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. MICs for RPR 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. RPR 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by RPR 106972 (MIC90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). Against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), RPR 106972 was highly active with MIC results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. RPR 106972 inhibited Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). RPR 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other Enterococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 1 microgram/ml). Studies to establish MIC quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of RPR 106972 against Gram-positive bacteria and selected Gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.
TI  - Differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - The in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1ra. Gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. In addition, blood was stimulated with E. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. E. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 production but levels of IL-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed E. coli. In contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed E. coli; polymyxin B decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
TI  - Comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  - The role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. In this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) BALB/c mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. We also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (IgA and IgG) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. The bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were Lactobacillus murinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus oralis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. When the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by L. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by E. faecalis (40-60%). The precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. We found that total salivary IgA levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but no association were observed between the level of salivary IgA antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. The change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of RU-59863, a C-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. RU-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against Enterobacteriaciae (MIC90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), Acinetobacter ssp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). Potent RU-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (MIC90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). RU-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited by RU-59863 (MIC90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). Among the cephalosporins tested, RU-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant Bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. RU-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. RU-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against Gram-negative pathogens resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. Further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, various beta-lactam antibiotics and, where appropriate, clindamycin and vancomycin against a range of Gram-positive bacteria including staphylococci (n = 201), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 100), Streptococcus milleri (n = 18) and enterococci (n = 161) by an agar dilution technique. In addition, time-kill studies were performed to estimate the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. milleri and viridans group streptococci. Trovafloxacin was the most active agent tested against staphylococci. It also showed good activity, at least four-fold and usually eight- to 16-fold that of ciprofloxacin, against all the streptococci. Trovafloxacin showed good activity against vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, but was less active against the 11 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Trovafloxacin showed comparable or superior bactericidal activity to amoxycillin against the S. milleri and viridans group streptococci tested.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, Haemophilus and pathogenic Neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  - The phosphorylcholine (PC) determinant in Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (C-Ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (Forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. Western blotting with two PC specific murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) designated 145,F-2 (IgM) and 147,A-1 (IgA) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis. Purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the PC of LTA. Unlike other techniques, Western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the PC epitope. Gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 Haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the MAbs. For this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. Analyses by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) detected the PC epitope in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fraction from H. influenzae. Some strains of the Neisseriaceae family were also positive by Western blotting, but TLC and immunostaining did not detect the PC determinant in LPS.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Although a number of studies have reported the MICs of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. We tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. Zone diameters and MICs were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. Control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of Enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/L as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/L as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. The best correlation of zone sizes and MICs for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an MIC of < or = 2 mg/L was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. These criteria may be useful for identifying organisms that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - Microbiological cultures of heart valves and valve tags are not valuable for patients without infective endocarditis who are undergoing valve replacement.
AB  - We evaluated the significance of the results of microbiological cultures of heart valves and identification tags from newly inserted prosthetic valves that were removed from patients with valvular heart disease; none of these patients had a preoperative diagnosis of endocarditis. We reviewed the charts of patients with positive cultures for evidence of infections before or after surgery. Cultures were positive for 11.9% of 219 valves (206 native valves and 13 prosthetic or bioprosthetic valves) and 11.6% of 224 tags. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci. Typical agents of endocarditis--viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus--were cultured from five specimens, and Mycobacterium avium complex was identified in six valves. None of the patients with positive valve or tag cultures developed postsurgical endocarditis or wound infection. Findings on histopathologic examination of the valves were not consistent with endocarditis. We conclude that the results of cultures of valves from patients without preoperative diagnoses of endocarditis lack clinical significance, and positive tag cultures are not predictive of postsurgical infection. Positive cultures are most likely a result of contamination during surgery or thereafter.
TI  - Limited diversity of Streptococcus pneumoniae psaA among pneumococcal vaccine serotypes.
AB  - The pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) is a surface-exposed protein of the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. It belongs to a group of proteins designated the lipoprotein receptor I antigen family. The gene encoding PsaA from an encapsulated strain of pneumococcal serotype 6B was cloned and sequenced. The peptide sequence was compared to that of homologs found in S. pneumoniae serotype 2, viridans streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. Identity values among the deduced peptides ranged from 57 to 98%. The polymorphism of psaA was examined among the 23 encapsulated vaccine serotypes by using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Ten different enzymes were used to analyze 80 strains representing the 23 serotypes in a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. This analysis showed that restriction sites within the gene were highly conserved, with only a minor variation occurring in 10% of the strains, the result of an additional Tsp509I site. The lack of variation for the other restriction sites within the gene examined here indicates that psaA is genetically conserved, an important characteristic necessary for a candidate common protein vaccine.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - The activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone CG 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CG 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. CG 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/L or less, exceptions being Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp. (MIC90 4 mg/L). Ninety per cent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/L respectively. CG 5501 had high activity against Gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/L. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/L or less of CG 5501. Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 4 mg/L) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. Enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to CG 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. CG 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Five strains of Chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/L of CG 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/L of CG 5501. The high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that CG 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
TI  - Synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  - Glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. The one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. The results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13C-NMR studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. These oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by Streptococcus mutans, and they effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. In an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by Bifidobacteria.
TI  - Use of an excision reporter plasmid to study the intracellular mobility of the conjugative transposon Tn916 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - An excision reporter plasmid was constructed to characterize the intracellular mobility of Tn916 in various Gram-positive bacteria. The reporter component of this plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistance gene which has been insertionally inactivated with the integrative vector pAT112 containing the attachment site of Tn916. Tn916-mediated excision of pAT112, to produce clones resistant to chloramphenicol, was detected in Enterococcus faecalis BM4110, Listeria monocytogenes L028-Str and Streptococcus gordonii BM120, but not in Lactococcus lactis MG1363-RF or in Streptococcus pneumoniae BM124, and always depended upon the ability of the bacterial host to generate circular forms of the transposon. The results suggest that (i) the excision event, although required, is not sufficient for conjugal transfer to occur and (ii) there is no linear relationship between the donor potential of E. faecalis strains and either the excision frequency of pAT112 or the copy number of Tn916 circular intermediates per cell in these hosts. Excision of pAT112 occurred mainly during the late exponential phase of growth of E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes and this recombination event was not stimulated by heat shock, salt and alcohol stresses or by the presence of tetracycline in the medium.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - In vitro irradiation of infected root canals with a diode laser: results of microbiologic, infrared spectrometric, and stain penetration examinations.
AB  - This study aimed to examine the suitability of the diode laser with a wavelength  of 810 nm for reducing bacteria in root canals. Forty-four extracted, endodontically prepared teeth were inoculated with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. No bacterial growth was observed when the teeth were irradiated at an output power of 4 W and a pulse rate of 10 milliseconds, with breaks of 10 milliseconds between the irradiations. Exposure time was five times 5 seconds. Infrared spectroscopic examinations revealed that irradiation at 4 W under even circling movements resulted in a maximum rise in temperature of 6 degrees C on the root surface. Stain penetration tests and scanning electron microscopic examinations revealed complete closure of the dentinal tubules on the irradiated root canal walls.
TI  - Primary and secondary structures of rRNA spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  - The 16S-23S and 23S-5S rRNA spacer DNA regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus mundtii were amplified by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. Whereas lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without tRNA(Ala) were characterized. However, as shown for lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto, the tRNA(Ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal CCA trinucleotide. A putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the tRNA(Ala) gene. Based on comparison with Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. In E, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no tRNA(Ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. A similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in E. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. Such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23S rRNA coding sequences of some Gram-negative bacteria. The spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the tRNA(Ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of DNA-based typing methods.
TI  - Plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - Bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. During lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host chromosome at the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (L. Dupont et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). A nonreplicative vector (pMC1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attP site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei (two strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Integrative recombination of pMC1 into the chromosomes of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pMC1 attP site. The isolation and sequencing of pMC1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pMC1 integrated into the conserved tRNA(Ser) gene. In the other bacterial species where this tRNA gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic DNA were used. A consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. The comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide CCT at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.
TI  - Use of Tn917 to generate insertion mutations in the group A streptococcus.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 is functional in a broad range of bacteria, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. We cloned Tn917-LTV3, a derivative carrying a promoterless lacZ (beta-galactosidase gene), into the thermosensitive shuttle replicon pG+host4 and assayed for chromosomal insertions in group A streptococcus (GAS). Tn917 transposed into the GAS chromosome at a frequency of (2.8 +/- 3.2) x 10(-5) per colony forming unit (cfu). Transposition products were predominantly simple insertions and no target site preference was detectable. Some transcriptional fusions were identified in which the promoterless lacZ of the transposon appeared to be expressed from an external promoter.
TI  - Thermal effects and antibacterial properties of energy levels required to sterilize stained root canals with an Nd:YAG laser.
AB  - Thermal effects and antibacterial properties of an Nd:YAG laser were studied to establish clinically safe levels of energy to deliver into the root canal and to determine the energy level needed to sterilize infected root canals. The results indicate that lasing cycles of 3 J-s for 15 s followed by a 15-s recovery interval can be continued for prolonged periods without risk of thermal damage to surrounding tissues. In vitro lasing of root canals inoculated with dark stained bacteria showed that two such lasing cycles sterilized only two out of eight canals, whereas when four cycles were used seven out of eight canals were sterilized. Guidelines for energy levels in endodontic Nd:YAG laser work are discussed, and base data for calculating appropriate energy levels are given.
TI  - Tissue penetration of Meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. Plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. The median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/mL. The median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. These tissue concentrations exceed the MICs of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. Meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. A single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - [Nationwide survey of susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1992].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents in 144 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1992. In this study, the isolates were identified and susceptibility tests were performed at individual laboratories. The susceptibility tests were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. S. aureus (including MRSA) strains were highly susceptible to arbekacin (ABK) and netilmicin (NTL). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were susceptible to most of the agents tested. E. faecalis were highly susceptible to penicillins and imipenem (IPM). P. aeruginosa showed high susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM and amikacin (AMK). Annual changes in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns over 5 years (1988-1992) were examined. The frequency of sensitive strains of S. aureus to methicillin (DMPPC) has slightly increased from 1991 to 1992. A moderate increases of PCG-insensitive S. pneumoniae was observed. B. fragilis group showed a slight increase in sensitivity to minocycline (MINO) but no yearly changes in IPM sensitivity was observed.
TI  - In vitro activity and spectrum of LY333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  - Reference methods were used to determine the potency of LY333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key N-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) (in micrograms per milliliter) of LY333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for Streptococcus serogroups A, B, C, and G, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for Streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%; and for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. LY333328 was not active (MIC50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Gram-positive anaerobes were LY333328 susceptible (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Test methods and conditions may have affected MICs of LY333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution MICs being greater than the broth microdilution MICs.
TI  - The efficiency of root canal disinfection using a holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser in vitro.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the bactericidal effect of a holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser on root canals in vitro. The efficiency of different laser settings was compared. The in vitro examinations revealed extensive bacterial reduction in extracted, endodontically prepared teeth that had been incubated with Streptococcus faecalis with the most favorable results at a setting of 5 Hz and 2 W. In average, 99.98% of the bacteria injected in the root canal could be eliminated. Considering this bactericidal effect, the application of the Ho:YAG laser in root canal treatment appears to be very efficient.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. An update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  - Although resistance has developed among Gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. However, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the USA but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this European surveillance study. The European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. The primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in European hospitals. The in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the Italian centres. In total, 7078 Gram-positive isolates were collected in Europe, and national coordinators used the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. According to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. In general, the range of MICs for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Against Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was 4 times more active than vancomycin. The greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in Enterococcus faecium than in E. faecalis. The results from the Italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. In particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. The incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in Italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in Europe (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). This extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in acute appendicitis.
AB  - The effect of acute appendicitis (AA) on aerobic urinary tract infection was investigated. Abnormal urinalysis and urinary tract infection in patients with AA have seldom been reported previously. Appendectomy was performed in 84 patients with no previous urogenital, retroperitoneal, or pelvic disease, trauma or operation and AA was pathologically confirmed in 66 of them. Aerobic cultures of appendiceal tissue and mesenteriolum were done. Control groups included 25 patients with inguinal hernioplasty and 40 patients with varicocele repair. Urinalysis and urine culture were done prior to operation, and on days 1, 3, and 6 postoperatively. The "O" serogrouping identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was performed in the appendix, mesenteriolum and urine. Abnormal urinalysis was found in 48% of patients with AA before appendectomy, and in 12% on day 6 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Aerobes were isolated from urine in 32% of patients before appendectomy and in 24% on day 6 following surgery. E. coli was more often found in the appendix than in the mesenteriolum (P < 0.05). In seven out of 66 patients (11%) bacteriuria of more than 10(5) was found. All of them had identical aerobic strain isolated from the appendix, mesenteriolum and urine (E. coli in 4, Streptococcus faecalis in 2 and Corynebacterium species in one patient) according to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and "O" serogrouping of E. coli. Lower urinary tract infection was clinically manifested on day 3 postoperatively in 4 of them and in none from the control groups. Bacteria spreading from the appendix to the retroperitoneal space may invade the urinary tract and cause either symptomatic or asymptomatic urinary tract infection in patients with AA.
TI  - Glucose starvation response in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  - We investigated the survival of Enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. Inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. Antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. During the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (A, B, C and D) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. Our results show that proteins from the two early classes (A and B) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in E. faecalis. One protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. The N-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class A, showed strong homology with the N-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from Streptococcus faecium. This enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the Cst proteins of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cell-cell communication in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In gram-positive bacteria, many important processes are controlled by cell-to-cell communication, which is mediated by extracellular signal molecules produced by the bacteria. Most of these signaling molecules are peptides or modified peptides. Signal processing, in most cases, involves either transduction across the cytoplasmic membrane or import of the signal and subsequent interaction with intracellular effectors. Concentrations of signal in the nanomolar range or below are frequently sufficient for biological activity. The microbial processes controlled by extracellular signaling include the expression of virulence factors, the expression of gene transfer functions, and the production of antibiotics.
TI  - [1996 pathogen incidence and resistance status in peritonitis].
AB  - Severe intra-abdominal infection is associated with a high mortality rate. In addition to risk factors in the patients, the causal pathogens and the selection of appropriate therapeutic procedures play an essential part in the course of these conditions. In the majority of intra-abdominal infections mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections, mostly with some involvement of enterobacteria and also of enterococci and staphylococci can be demonstrated. In addition to surgical intervention a calculated antimicrobial initial treatment of intra-abdominal infections with an antibiotic with an adequate effect to combat the pathogen concerned can contribute to improving the patient's prognosis. A calculated antibiotic treatment can only be effectively and reliably carried through if the frequency of the pathogen and the resistance situation are known. Retrospective evaluations of data on the sensitivity and frequency of pathogens from a defined group of subjects allow conclusions on the epidemiological situation in a particular catchment area or in a medical sector and thus make it possible to calculate the appropriate therapy for infections. In 1996 a total of 2,779 bacterial isolates from the intra-abdominal infection sector were examined: 935 Enterobacteriaceae, 83 nonfermenters, 177 Staphylococcus spp., 211 Enterococcus spp., 39 Streptococcus spp., and 1334 different anaerobic bacteria. Fresh clinical isolates were available for all pathogens tested. The most frequent gram-negative pathogen was E. coli (60%) and the most frequent gram-positive pathogen, E. faecalis (44%); the most frequent anaerobic pathogen was B. fragilis (39%). Taurolodine had the lowest resistance rate against gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. Teicoplanin had the highest activity against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  - Emergence of vancomycin resistance in the genus Streptococcus: characterization of a vanB transferable determinant in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis NEM760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Strain NEM760 was identified as S. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA. This strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (MIC, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. The presence of a vanB-related gene in NEM760 was demonstrated in a PCR assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanB. Sequence analysis of the corresponding PCR product revealed that it was highly homologous (96% identity) to the prototype vanB sequence of Enterococcus faecalis V583. The VanB resistance of determinant of S. bovis NEM760 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per donor. SmaI-digested genomic DNAs of independently obtained transconjugants of E. faecalis and E. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization with a vanB DNA probe. The electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanB-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. These results suggest that the genes mediating VanB-type resistance in S. bovis NEM760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. The results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219).
AB  - Trovafloxacin was found to be a typical quinolone producing a biphasic dose response against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. A reduced rate of kill was seen against Enterococcus faecalis, which is also typical of the quinolones. However, the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was greater than most other quinolones previously tested. The enhanced bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. aureus may be explained by the possession of a very strong bactericidal mechanism B. Trovafloxacin may prove to be a quinolone of choice against S. aureus infections.
TI  - Effects of a mixture of organisms, Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis on cholesterol metabolism in rats fed on a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet.
AB  - The effect of a mixture of organisms (a probiotic mixture) comprising Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Saccharomyces and Candida (10(7-8) colony-forming units/g rice bran of each component) on lipid metabolism was compared with that of L. acidophilus and that of S. faecalis. There were four treatment groups: rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, L. acidophilus or S. faecalis (30 g/kg) were given to rats in a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 weeks. The serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed on the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at the end of the 4-week feeding period (P < 0.05). This group also had a lower hepatic cholesterol concentration (36-44%) than the two single-bacteria groups (P < 0.05). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A reductase (NADPH; EC 1.1.1.34) activities of the mixed-organism and L. acidophilus groups were significantly lower (61-63%) than those of the other groups (P < 0.05); the activity of the S. faecalis group was also significantly lower (42%) than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The faecal cholesterol and bile acid concentrations of the mixed-organism group increased compared with those of the L. acidophilus and S. faecalis groups (P < 0.05). The capacity of the mixed-organism cells to bind bile salt in vitro was significantly higher (approximately 50%) than that of the single-bacteria cells (P < 0.05). On the other hand, cholesterol micelle formation for the mixed-organism cells was significantly (approximately 9%) lower than that of the single-bacteria cells (P < 0.05). These results indicate that the mixture of organisms decreased the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver and increased the loss of steroids from the intestine, in rats. Thus, the mixture of organisms had a hypocholesterolaemic role.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a plasmid from Lactobacillus helveticus CP53.
AB  - A plasmid, pCP53 (11.5 kilo base pairs long), was isolated from Lactobacillus helveticus CP53 and its restriction map was constructed. A chimeric plasmid, pCP53D (4.7 kb), which had a 2.0-kb HindIII fragment from pCP53 and a tetracycline resistance (Tc) gene from Streptococcus faecalis replicated and expressed tetracycline resistance in Lactobacillus casei CP680. Fifteen strains of L. helveticus were transformed with pCP53D by electroporation and selected for Tc resistance. Transformants were obtained from two out of 15 host strains, L. helveticus CP611 and CP791, with 5 x 10(3) and 50 transformants per microgram of DNA, respectively.
TI  - Leuconostoc bacteremia in an infant with short-gut syndrome: case report and literature review.
AB  - In this article, we report a case of Leuconostoc bacteremia in a 7-month-old infant who had short-gut syndrome after a gastroschisis repair and who was dependent on total parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter. The organism was initially misidentified as viridans group streptococcus. Detection of vancomycin resistance led to the correct diagnosis of Leuconostoc species. The patient was successfully treated with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. A review of the literature revealed prematurity, short-gut syndrome, prior vancomycin use, and central venous catheters as important predisposing factors. Leuconostoc species is an emerging pathogen that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteremia, particularly in these clinical settings.
TI  - [Serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. Streptococcus is still the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the presence of antibody (AB), total and IgM by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (SIE), streptococcal bacteraemia (SB), Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. Antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with SIE and SB inverted question markhomologous AB inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of Streptococcus: Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus sanguis II, nutritional dependent streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis (heterologous AB). RESULTS: Homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with SIE and only in 2 with SB (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). IgM titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with SIE (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). The fall of the AB titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (AB titers were > or = 1/512 and IgM > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients 1 year later). Heterologous AB: in spite of statistically significant difference found in SIE versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256) is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of homologous AB for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. On the contrary for heterologous AB, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.
TI  - Pseudo-outbreak of Enterococcus durans infections and colonization associated with introduction of an automated identification system software update.
AB  - Enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. Since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the United States. Although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. raffinosus, and E. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. In January 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31 of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as E. durans. Twenty-nine isolates identified as E. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (Vitek gram-positive identification card, version R09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. When seven isolates initially reported as E. durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be E. faecium. Subsequently, isolates identified as E. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as E. durans. Automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. When laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.
TI  - Candida albicans binding to the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii involves multiple adhesin-receptor interactions.
AB  - Candida albicans binds to several species of oral streptococci, in particular Streptococcus gordonii, through recognition of a streptococcal cell wall polysaccharide receptor (A. R. Holmes, P. K. Gopal, and H. F. Jenkinson, Infect. Immun. 63:1827-1834, 1995). We now show that isogenic cell surface protein mutants of S. gordonii DL1, unaltered in expression of cell wall polysaccharide, are reduced in ability to support adherence of C. albicans cells in a solid-phase assay. Inactivation of the S. gordonii cshA and cshB genes, encoding high-molecular-mass cell surface polypeptides, and inactivation of the sspA and sspB genes, encoding antigen I/II salivary adhesins, resulted in 40 and 79% reductions, respectively, in adherence of C. albicans cells. Inactivation of the S. gordonii scaA gene encoding a cell surface lipoprotein had no effect on C. albicans adherence. Polyclonal antiserum to streptococcal antigen I/II protein SpaP and antibodies specific to the amino-terminal nonrepetitive (NR) domain of CshA both inhibited adherence of C. albicans to S. gordonii cells. Conversely antibodies to the amino acid repeat block repetitive (R) domain of CshA, or to ScaA, did not inhibit C. albicans adherence. Immobilized recombinant polypeptide fragments of CshA comprising NR domain or R domain sequences both supported adherence of C. albicans cells. Expression of S. gordonii SspB protein on the surface of Enterococcus faecalis conferred on the enterococcal cells the ability to bind C. albicans, and this was ablated by antigen I/II antiserum. Collectively the results suggest that interaction of C. albicans with S. gordonii is mediated by a complement of adhesin-receptor interactions that involves two families of streptococcal multifunctional polypeptide adhesins, bacterial cell wall polysaccharide, and as yet unidentified yeast cell surface components.
TI  - Serological investigation of enterococcal infections using western blot.
AB  - To assess the usefulness of Western blot in the diagnosis of enterococcal infections, a pilot study was conducted with a newly developed Western blot using sera from patients with confirmed enterococcal infections. Sera from 17 of 19 patients with enterococcal endocarditis reacted strongly to enterococcal antigens on the Western blot, and most produced specific bands at molecular weights 98 kDa and 54 kDa. Sera from patients with bacteremic cholangitis and pyelonephritis reacted frequently as well, but the pattern of bands was different from that observed with endocarditis. Eighty-five percent of 26 sera tested from patients with bacteremia and associated deep-seated infections (endocarditis, cholangitis, and pyelonephritis) were positive on Western blot, compared to 30% of sera from bacteremic patients with no clinically determined deep focus of infection (p < 0.001).
TI  - Nitric oxide mediates the action of lipoteichoic acid on the function of human urothelial cells.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are recognized pathogens in urinary tract infections. Lipoteichoic acids, major components of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, are important virulence attributes, but their mechanism of action is not well understood. We have postulated that infection-induced altered function of progenitors of urothelial cells (UT) residing in the basal layer is likely to have long-lasting effects on the architecture and function of the urothelium. Our earlier in vitro studies in UT of basal type, grown under growth restricting conditions, have shown that 1) treatment with lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis (LT-2) stimulates a subpopulation of progenitors of urothelial cells to proliferate, and 2) resulting large colonies differentiated at an increased rate under conditions simulating those in the basal layer of the urothelium. The hypothesis underlying the present studies was that nitric oxide (NO) mediated LT-2 action on these functions of UT. Immunocytochemical studies using an antibody against inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) confirmed expression of iNOS in LT-2-treated UT. Our hypothesis was tested by treating UT grown under growth restricting conditions (0.005% bovine pituitary extract) with LT-2 (25 micrograms/ml), in the presence or absence of inhibitors of NOS (1 mM NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester [L-NAME]; 1 microM dexamethasone [DEXA]) or 25 microM hemoglobin, a potent inactivator of NO. Treatment with LT-2 in the presence of these agents prevented the following effects of LT-2 alone: 1) the stimulatory effect on proliferation of single cells, as well as within the resulting large colonies; 2) the subsequent differentiation of large colonies resulting from this proliferative activity, as indicated by distribution of beta 1 subunit-containing integrins to cell-cell contacts; 3) the inhibitory effect on the subsequent ability of LT-2-treated UT to attach to extracellular matrix proteins. These studies suggest that induction of NOS by LT-2, initially aimed at restricting the replication of infectious agents, may have potential cost of damage to the host bladder by interfering with urothelial differentiation.
TI  - Long-term treatment with lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis affects differentiation and expression and cellular distribution of beta 1 integrins in human urothelial cells.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are recognized pathogens in urinary tract infections. Cellular mechanisms triggered by lipoteichoic acids (LTs), cell well components of gram-positive bacteria, have not been completely defined. We have postulated that infection-induced altered function of progenitors of urothelial cells residing in the basal layer is likely to have long lasting effects on the architecture and function of the urothelium. Our recent studies in vitro showed that treatment of poorly differentiated urothelial cells of basal type with LT from Streptococcus faecalis (LT-2) stimulated rapid proliferation of a subpopulation of progenitors of urothelial cells, supporting this possibility (Elgavish et al., 1996, J. Cell. Physiol., 169:42-51). The hypothesis underlying the present studies was that, following LT-triggered increase in proliferation of progenitors, the rate of differentiation of the resulting progeny was also stimulated. We proposed that this mechanism may allow rapid removal of cells from the injured area and replacement by cells that have not been exposed to infection. To simulate in vitro conditions in the basal layer that inhibit terminal differentiation, cells grew on fibronectin or collagen-coated substrate, in medium containing low Ca2+ (0.2 mM) and low levels of growth factors (0.005% bovine pituitary extract [BPE]). During the last 3 days in culture, cells grew in the same low Ca2+ (0.2 mM) medium, but without BPE, with or without LT-2. In a positive control group, cells grew during their last 3 days in culture in medium without BPE and LT-2 but in which levels levels of Ca2+ were higher (2 mM), a condition known to stimulate differentiation in other cell types. Several lines of evidence supported the possibility that long-term treatment with LT-2 stimulated progression of large colonies (i.e., the progeny resulting from LT-triggered proliferation) to a more differentiated state: (1) the rate of their differentiation, determined by criterion of intense cytokeratin 8 expression, was increased; (2) steady-state level of beta mRNA and expression of beta 1 subunit of integrins at the protein level were inhibited; (3) in contrast to large colonies in control cultures, the entire population of LT-2-treated large colonies contained beta 1 integrins distributed at cell-cell contacts. Raising extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 2 mM induced similar effects, suggesting that LT-2 may act by stimulating an increase in intracellular levels of Ca2+. However, further studies will be needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effect of LT-2 on proliferation of progenitors of urothelial cells in the basal layer of the urothelium and subsequent differentiation of their progeny. We propose that these processes may have a causative role in the pathological changes that occur in the aftermath of chronic or recurrent suburothelial infection in the urinary bladder.
TI  - A subpopulation of human urothelial cells is stimulated to proliferate by treatment in vitro with lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Urinary tract infection with gram-positive bacteria is common. Avenues for ingress of bacteria into the bladder include luminal and suburothelial infection. Terminally differentiated superficial urothelial cells lining the lumen of the bladder are often shed in response to infection. In contrast, infection-induced altered function of progenitors of urothelial cells residing in the basal layer of the urothelium is likely to have long lasting effects on the structure and function of the urothelium. The main objective of the present studies was to investigate in vitro the possibility that exposure to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of the gram-positive Streptococcus faecalis (LT-2), stimulates basal urothelial cells to proliferate. To simulate conditions that restrict proliferation and inhibit terminal differentiation of urothelial cells in the basal layer, secondary cultures of urothelial cells (UT) were grown on collagen or fibronectin coated substrate in medium containing low levels of Ca2+ (0.2 mM) and growth factors (0.005% bovine pituitary extract [BPE]). Under these conditions, UT cultures displayed a highly reproducible colony size distribution, possibly due to the fact that colonies were progeny of basal cells with various proliferative potentials, retained in vitro. In cultures grown under growth-restricting conditions the majority of progenitors appeared to be quiescent, just like stem cells in the basal layer of the urothelium. Thus, the population of large colonies (more than six cells/colony), was small when a steady state of growth was achieved, 3-7 days after seeding. Growth factors (0.005-0.5% BPE) caused a dose-dependent increase in this population of large colonies. Moreover, treatment of UT grown under growth-restricting conditions (0.005% BPE) with LT-2 increased steady-state levels of the population of large colonies to levels obtained in cultures growing under optimal conditions with respect to growth factors. These results indicated that the subpopulation of progenitors, quiescent under normal conditions, could be stimulated to proliferate. Two lines of evidence were consistent with the possibility that treatment with LT-2 stimulated proliferation of the subpopulation of progenitors and that large colonies were the progeny of this subpopulation of single cells: (1) treatment with LT-2 increased the percentage of single cells that incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (i.e., proliferated) in a time-dependent manner. (2) An increase in the percentage of large colonies was found following LT-2-triggered proliferation of single cells. We propose that, under normal conditions, cells produced in response to LT-2-triggered proliferation of stem cells are removed from the system due to an increased rate of differentiation followed by apoptosis. Recurrent infection and inflammation may not allow these processes to proceed effectively, resulting in chronic injury to the bladder. Moreover, under conditions in which stem cells accumulate mutations that incapacitate their progeny to undergo apoptosis, LT-triggered proliferation could be a contributing factor to tumorigenesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500) are described. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. Streptogramin drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The combination is more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis. It has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. The mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/L for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/L for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. Mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. The drug is under investigation in the United States in Phase III trials. Of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving E. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. Of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. The efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. The drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. Adverse reactions are generally mild and transient. Quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.
TI  - Serum antibodies to commensal oral and gut bacteria vary with age.
AB  - This study examined the relationship between serum antibody levels to selected bacteria from the commensal oral and gut flora with increased age in a healthy adult population. A total of 116 healthy subjects were studied consisting of the following age groups: 20-39 years (group A), 40-59 years (group B), 60-79 years (group C) and 80+ years (group D). Only significantly lower mean IgM antibody levels to Streptococcus mutans strain Guy's serotype c were observed in older age groups (P < 0.001). With Actinomyces viscosus NCTC 10951 significantly reduced IgM levels (P < 0.02) and significantly elevated IgA levels were observed with increased age (P < 0.05). IgA and IgG antibodies to Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 were increased significantly in the older age groups (P < 0.001), whilst a trend toward lower levels of IgM antibodies was recorded with age. No changes in IgA antibodies to Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 were observed but the lowest level of IgM antibodies were detected in the oldest age group (P < 0.05). Mean specific activity was decreased with age with IgM antibodies to the oral bacteria and increased with age with IgG and IgA antibodies to E. coli. Overall, our results suggest a general reduction in serum IgM antibody responses. This impairment in the circulatory IgM immune response may contribute to the increased occurrence of infections in the elderly.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (GPB). Previous investigations showed that the macrophage scavenger receptor (SR), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many GPB, possibly via LTA. SR binding to other ligands is dependent upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand. We therefore investigated SR recognition of LTA species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these LTAs to compete with the binding of metabolically labeled SR to beads coated with the known SR ligand polyguanylic acid. Staphylococcus aureus LTA, a classical LTA type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of SR binding of 0.84 microg/ml. When the S. aureus LTA was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the IC50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. Other polyglycerophosphate LTAs from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria welshimeri, and Streptococcus sanguis showed IC50S of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to SR. Accordingly, the zwitterionic LTA of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Clostridium innocuum LTA substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. Monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. The data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated LTA as a major ligand of GPB for binding to SR. Whether binding of LTA and whole GPB to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  - Diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus bovis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes. Principal components analysis of the FT-IR spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their FT-IR spectra. By contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their FT-IR spectra. These results demonstrate that the combination of FT-IR and ANNs provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of levofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin against 506 Gram-positive bacteria was compared with those of D(-)-ofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. Levofloxacin was generally twice as active as ofloxacin against these organisms (range, 0-3 twofold dilutions). Sparfloxacin appeared to have the greatest activity overall, but for several groups of organisms minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90s) of this compound were within one twofold dilution of those of levofloxacin. Resistance to levofloxacin (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml) was not encountered among streptococcal species, was rare in methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (1.7%), and was infrequent in vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (8.7%). Resistance was more common among vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Direct application of Etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  - The Etest was applied directly to 100 Gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results showed 100% concordance of MIC data between a direct Etest method and the standard Etest method for Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. In addition, direct Etest for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard Etests. These data indicate that the Etest is useful to obtain MIC data on Gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. The advantages of a direct Etest are two fold: MIC results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.
TI  - The tetracycline resistance gene tet(M) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  - Tetracycline resistance genes of the M class, tet(M), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. By comparing the sequences of eight different tet(M) genes (from Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. The two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and a different G/C content. The block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(M) locus. Unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(M) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(M) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - The use of gadolinium-BOPTA on magnetic resonance imaging in brain infection.
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The use of gadolinium (Gd)-BOPTA as a magnetic resonance contrast agent for central nervous system disease was studied in a canine brain abscess model. METHODS: A Streptococcus faecalis brain abscess was evaluated in five dogs at 1.5T. Imaging was performed during the late cerebritis stage, at 5 to 7 days after surgery. Magnetic resonance scans were acquired before and at 1, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after contrast administration, using a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. Scans also were acquired both before and after contrast injection with the implementation of magnetization transfer. RESULTS: Lesion enhancement, quantified by region-of-interest measurement, peaked at 5 minutes after contrast injection. Both the increase in lesion enhancement from 1 to 5 minutes after injection and the decrease from 5 to 15 minutes after injection, although small, were statistically significant (P < 0.004 and P < 0.03, respectively). The application of magnetization transfer improved lesion enhancement, as measured by signal difference/noise, by 39%. This result also was statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In intraparenchymal brain infection, Gd-BOPTA provides effective lesion enhancement when used at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. Further research is needed to compare the magnitude of enhancement achieved with Gd-BOPTA, which has weak protein binding and both hepatobiliary and renal excretion, with that with Gd chelates, which have pure renal excretion.
TI  - Chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon Tn3706 in Streptococcus agalactiae B128.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae B128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group B streptococcal (GBS) strain described so far. This strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated Tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the Tn4001 and Tn5281 transpons detected in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Transposition of Tn3706 occurred onto the GBS plasmid pIP501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb AvaII fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. Molecular analysis of pIP501 derivatives showed that Tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of IS256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and a single inverted copy of IS256 at its 3' extremity. The two tandemly repeated copies of IS256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the same orientation, in the IS256-aac6'-aph2" junction. The hybrid replicons pIP501::Tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between GBS strains. Numerous individual copies of IS256 were detected in B128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible GBS strains studied.
TI  - [Severe orbital cellulitis: therapeutic results in 9 patients and review of the literature].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orbital cellulitis can produce severe neuromeningeal infections. Modern antimicrobial agents such as imipenem can be a valid therapeutical choice. METHODS: Patients with severe or complicated orbital cellulitis admitted to our hospital from 1986 through 1994 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Nine patients with severe orbital cellulitis, seven of them older than 14 years, are reported. Cellulitis was secondary to different forms of sinusitis in five of them. The incriminated microorganisms were: Streptococcus viridans alone or combined to gram negative bacilli (3 cases), Prevotella melaninogenica and other anaerobes (2 cases), Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus (one case each). Three patients developed brain abscesses, one an acute bacterial meningitis and another a subdural empyema. Eight patients underwent a surgical drainage. Seven patients were treated with IV imipenem at doses of 2-3 g/day with complete cure of the orbital cellulitis and of the associated infectious complications and no secondary effects. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem is an effective antibiotic in the combined medical-surgical treatment of the severe or complicated orbital cellulitis.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef (FMOX). Sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. Sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with E. coli and K. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. Therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against Streptococcus pneumoniae. While its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of imipenem/cilastatin against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and A. calcoaceticus.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of LB10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - LB10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. LB10517 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at 0.25 mg/L (MIC90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. LB10517 was two- or four-fold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. Both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) were highly resistant to all compounds. LB10517 activity against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a mouse septicaemia model, LB10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. In a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of LB10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. It was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for TEM-9 than the other test compounds. LB10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. LB10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E.
TI  - Phosphorylation-induced torsion-angle strain in the active center of HPr, detected by NMR and restrained molecular dynamics refinement.
AB  - The structure of the phosphorylated form of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr from Escherichia coli has been solved by NMR and compared with that of unphosphorylated HPr. The structural changes that occur upon phosphorylation of His 15, monitored by changes in NOE patterns, 3JNHH alpha-coupling constants, and chemical shifts, are limited to the region around the phosphorylation site. The His15 backbone torsion angles become strained upon phosphorylation. The release of this strain during the phosphoryl-transfer to Enzyme II facilitates the transport of carbohydrates across the membrane. From an X-ray study of Streptococcus faecalis HPr (Jia Z, Vandonselaar M, Quail JW, Delbaere LTJ, 1993, Nature 361:94-97), it was proposed that the observed torsion-angle strain at residue 16 in unphosphorylated S. faecalis HPr has a role to play in the protein's phosphocarrier function. The model predicts that this strain is released upon phosphorylation. Our observations on E. coli HPr in solution, which shows strain only after phosphorylation, and the fact that all other HPrs studied thus far in their unphosphorylated forms show no strain either, led us to investigate the possibility that the crystal environment causes the strain in S. faecalis HPr. A 1-ns molecular dynamics simulation of S. faecalis HPr, under conditions that mimic the crystal environment, confirms the observations from the X-ray study, including the torsion-angle strain at residue 16. The strain disappeared, however, when S. faecalis HPr was simulated in a water environment, resulting in an active site configuration virtually the same as that observed in all other unphosphorylated HPrs. This indicates that the torsion-angle strain at Ala 16 in S. faecalis HPr is a result of crystal contacts or conditions and does not play a role in the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. We associated the insertion sequence ISS1 with the thermosensitive replicon pG+ host to generate a mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. ISS1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus thermophilus. High-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in Lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. After ISS1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated ISS1 sequences flanking pG+ host. This structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. In addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single ISS1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. Mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.
TI  - Role of the C terminus in antigen P1 surface localization in Streptococcus mutans and two related cocci.
AB  - The C terminus of the major surface protein P1 from Streptococcus mutans is composed of a hydrophilic domain, an LPNTGV motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. These features are shared by surface proteins from many gram-positive coccal bacteria. To investigate the role of the C-terminal domains in antigen P1 surface localization, full-length and truncated P1 gene constructs, which were expressed on the shuttle vector pDL276, were transformed into the P1-negative mutant S. mutans SM3352, Streptococcus gordonii DL-1, and Enterococcus faecalis UV202. Transformants were tested for expression of P1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaying and Western blotting. The results showed that full-length P1 was expressed by transformants of all three bacteria and was localized on the cell surface. A fusion protein composed of the Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein C terminus and the P1 protein N terminus was found to surface localize in S. mutans. Deletion of the entire C-terminal domains resulted in P1 being expressed in the culture supernatant. A P1 truncation, which carried only the hydrophilic domain at its C terminus, was found partially associated with the cell surface. This truncated P1 was readily removed from the isolated cell wall by hot sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol extraction. In contrast, the full-length P1 remained associated with the isolated cell wall after similar treatment, suggesting covalent linkages between the full-length P1 and the cell wall. The results described above showed that antigen P1 was anchored to the cell wall by its C-terminal domains probably via covalent linkages with the cell wall. The results also support a universal mechanism involving the C-terminal domains for protein surface localization among this group of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - [Choice of media for detection of Streptococcus faecalis in routine water testing].
AB  - The aim the study was to find a medium for routine water testing for detection of Streptococcus faecalis which could be used by water supply laboratories and sanitary services. In the study dry ready Merck media were used: Mf-enterococcus agar, MF-enterococcus agar base, K-F-streptococcus agar, and Azide Nutrient Pad Sets (of Sartorius). The Slanetz-Bartley medium prepared in our laboratory National Institute of Hygiene (PZH). Method served as control. The usefulness of media for the isolation of Str. faecalis was tested in waters of household wells in the environs of Warsaw. Water from 50 wells was tested; from each well two samples of 10 ml and 100 ml were filtered. The filters were placed on the tested media and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Colonies with characteristic pink or orange brown colour were counted. From each plate 3-5 colonies were taken for verification tests. For verification tests 609 bacterial colonies showing characteristic growth on tested media were taken. For the statistical analysis of the results variance analysis was used which showed no significant differences between the control Slanetz-Bartley medium and the ready Merck media. These media can be used alternatively for routine water testing for detection of Str. faecalis. The Azide medium is not recommended since 96% of colonies showing in this test the growth characteristic of Str. faecalis were negative in verification tests. In routine water testing in case of growth of characteristic colonies on isolation media, it is recommended to carry out verification tests including, at least, a test for catalyse production, and culture on Litsky liquid medium or agar medium with bile salts and aesculin.
TI  - [Gram-positive, catalase negative cocci isolated from clinical material--identification and drug sensitivity of strains].
AB  - 4608 clinical specimens (including 1641 samples of blood) for bacteriological examination were obtained from patients hospitalized in different wards of National Clinical Hospital No 1 in Warsaw. Strains were cultured, identified and their sensitivity to antibacterial drugs was determined during 14 months with the use of semi-automated API (ATB-plus) system (bioMerieux, France). Strains of Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were separated from all cultured strains. They belonged to the genera: Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Aerococcus and Lactococcus (538 strains altogether). 238 Streptococcus spp. strains (44.2%) and 201 Enterococcus spp. strains (37.4%)were isolated from all specimens. The greatest number of catalase-negative cocci was obtained from wound smears -420 strains, which amounts to 78.2% of all strains. Among isolates dominated E. faecalis strains -104 (19.3%) and E. faecium strains - 70 (13.0% of all isolated strains). Vancomycin was the most effective antibacterial drug against gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci isolated from patients hospitalized in our hospital. Vancomycin-resistant strains constituted from 3% to 18% of strains depending on a species.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis disc space infection following transurethral resection of  prostate.
AB  - The case of a 65-year-old diabetic patient who developed L5/S1 disc space infection caused by Streptococcus faecalis is reported. The patient had a history of a fall followed by transurethral resection of prostate within 2 weeks before presentation. Parenteral vancomycin administered for 6 weeks aborted the infection. The patient made good recovery. This is the first reported case of Streptococcus faecalis primary intervertebral disc space infection. The importance of prophylactic antibiotics during urosurgical operations in diabetic patients is stressed.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - To discover the molecular properties of two distinct NADH oxidases, corresponding to H2O2-forming oxidase (NOX-1) and H2O-forming oxidase (NOX-2) induced in Streptococcus mutans, for the first step we had cloned and sequenced the nox-1 gene encoding NOX-1. In this paper, a nox-2 gene encoding NOX-2 from S. mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The nox-2 gene comprises 1371 base-pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. The deduced relative molecular mass (M(r) = 49919) agreed with the previous value obtained from the purified NOX-2 protein. The nox-2 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the NOX-2 protein sequence with that of the NOX-1 showed that the proteins do not significantly resemble each other. Comparisons with the NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 yield identities of 41%. The redox-active cysteine in the enzyme from S. faecalis was found to correspond to Cys 44 in the NOX-2.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - [Bioantimutagenic effect of the culture fluid of Streptococcus faecalis on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1538 and TA 98].
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis growing in rich organic media or synthetic medium containing 0.1% trypton and 0.05% yeast extract was shown to form substances with a bioantimutagenic activity against the mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, which induce frameshift and base-pair substitution mutations, respectively. The maximum accumulation of antimutagens in the medium was observed within 16-24 h of growth. The modified Ames test showed that the culture liquid of Str. faecalis possessed a higher antimutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 1538 than for strain TA 98 with an enhanced SOS response. Fractionation of the culture liquid revealed that the bioantimutagenic activity is localized in the fraction of peptides with molecular masses of less than 12 kDa.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. This chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the genes of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10 involved in replication and in negative control of pheromone-inducible conjugation.
AB  - The prgB gene of the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-inducible conjugative plasmid pCF10 encodes the surface protein Asc10. This protein mediates cell aggregation and its expression results in high-frequency transfer of the plasmid from donor to recipient. To identify the minimum region necessary for negative regulation of prgB expression, target plasmids were constructed containing a recently identified positive control region and a prgB::lacZ transcriptional fusion; expression of prgB in cells carrying these plasmids was thus verified by beta-galactosidase assay. The target plasmids were used in genetic studies with compatible plasmids containing cloned pCF10 genes supplying putative negative control functions to define the minimum region of pCF10 required for shutdown of prgB expression in the absence of exogenous pheromone. The minimum segment required for negative control, as indentified by deletion analysis, was a 6.9-kb region extending from the 5' end of a gene called prgN, through a previously identified gene, prgX. The DNA in this region, which had not been previously characterized (2.85 kb), was sequenced, and several potential regulatory genes and plasmid replication genes were identified. Genetic analysis indicated that the prgN, -Y, and -X genes are involved in negative control; prgW may also play a role in negative control, since it appeared to be required for expression of prgY. prgX, or a closely adjacent DNA sequence, acted in cis. The region of pCF10 containing negative control genes was also shown to function as an autonomous replicon in E. faecalis.
TI  - Conversion of oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid by two species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria able to convert oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid were isolated from  the ovine rumen. The solid hydroxy fatty acid produced from bacterial fermentations containing oleic acid was recovered by filtration, extraction into ether and crystallisation. The identity of the product was confirmed by HPLC and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. One 10-hydroxystearic-acid-producing bacterial group was represented by two strains of an anaerobic gram-negative curved rod with tufts of flagella on the concave surface of the cell. The morphology and other characteristics enabled the strains to be tentatively identified as Selenomonas ruminantium. Another bacterium capable of the same transformation, represented by two strains of a facultatively anaerobic gram positive chain-forming coccus, was identified as Enterococcus faecalis. Since unsaturated fatty acids entering the rumen are normally hydrogenated, hydration of oleic acid represents an alternative fate of unknown significance in vivo.
TI  - Immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis caused by streptococci and enterococci.
AB  - AIM: To improve the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis by diagnosing cases due to streptococci and enterococci. METHODS: Serum samples were immunoblotted against extracts of the commonest streptococci and enterococci. They were selected from patients with a cardiac murmur, persistent pyrexia and at least three negative blood cultures. The presence of patterns of endocarditis species specific antigenic bands was measured and correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Negative serology was found in 28 patients where the diagnosis of endocarditis was rejected or, if proved, staphylococcal, yeast, Gram negative, systemic lupus erythematosus, due to Q fever or Chlamydia psittaci or nonbacterial thrombotic. Positive serology was found in 27 of the 34 patients where the response to antibiotics suggested streptococcal or enterococcal infection. In 22 of these there was objective evidence of endocarditis. Positive serology was also found in three of four further patients with vegetations at necropsy. CONCLUSION: The identification of patterns of antibody response on immunoblotting can be used to make a specific diagnosis of streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis in the absence of positive blood cultures.

TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - Pathogenicity of bacteria using a simulated root canal system.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of an implantation test using Teflon-simulated root canals for evaluating the pathogenicity of root canal bacteria. Models including suspensions of lyophilized strains (Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus faecalis, and Porphyromonas asaccharolyticus) were implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue for 1 wk, and histological changes were observed. Severe inflammation occurred around the models. Among them, P. asaccharolyticus induced the severest inflammatory response. Further study using P. asaccharolyticus was conducted to compare the implantation test's ability to evaluate pathogenicity with that of an injection test at 1, 2, or 4 wk. Tissue injected with a bacterial suspension showed no clear response through the experimental periods, whereas tissue around implantation sites showed a severe response at 1 wk. However, the inflammatory response subsided at later stages. Consequently, further improvement is needed to investigate pathogenicity for long periods.
TI  - Effect of bleaching agents on dentin permeability to Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of dentin may be a contributing factor in the development of bleaching-associated root resorption. In this study, the effect of commonly used bleaching agents on the permeability of dentin tubules to Streptococcus faecalis was evaluated. Sixty extracted bovine incisors were horizontally sectioned apically to the cementoenamel junction. In each tooth, a standard cavity was prepared, the pulp tissue extirpated, and remnants of soft tissue and smear layer were removed. Following rinsing and repeated autoclave sterilization, the teeth were divided into four groups, each treated with one of the following materials: 30% hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate mixed with 30% hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate mixed with distilled water, and distilled water alone that served as control. The bleaching agents were sealed in the teeth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 7, 14, and 21 days. At each time interval the bleaching agents were removed and the teeth incubated at 37 degrees C in brain heart infusion infected with S. faecalis. Histological sections were prepared, and the maximal bacterial penetration for each group was measured using a computerized morphometric system. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that teeth treated with either 30% hydrogen peroxide alone or in combination with sodium perborate were significantly more permeable to S. faecalis than those treated with sodium perborate mixed with water (p < 0.0001). Sodium perborate mixed with water did not cause an increase in dentin permeability to S. faecalis and was similar to the water control. In conclusion, it seems that bleaching agents containing hydrogen peroxide in high concentrations may increase bacterial penetration through dentinal tubules.
TI  - Activities of the semisynthetic glycopeptide LY191145 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - LY191145 is the prototype of a series of compounds with activities against vancomycin-resistant enterococci derived by modification of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826. LY191145 had MICs for vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterococci of < or = 4 micrograms/ml for 50% of isolates and < or = 16 micrograms/ml for 90% of isolates. Its MICs for vancomycin-resistant, teicoplanin-susceptible enterococci were 1 to 8 micrograms/ml. LY191145 retains the potent activities of its parent compound against staphylococci and streptococci. In vivo studies in a mouse infection model confirmed these activities. This compound indicates the potential of semisynthetic glycopeptides as agents against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess: warning indicator of silent colonic cancer. Report of a case and review of the literature.
AB  - PURPOSE: Carcinoma of the colon, manifested clinically as an enterococcal hepatic abscess, in the absence of liver metastases, is very uncommon. However, having treated a patient with such a condition, we would like to draw the attention of surgeons to this possibility. Most reports describe secondary infections of hepatic metastases only in patients with a known malignancy. However, increased awareness of colonic cancer as an underlying cause of pyogenic liver abscesses will afford earlier diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The case was analyzed for history, presentation, laboratory data, radiologic studies, and bacteriology. RESULTS: A 66-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Imaging scans revealed a solitary liver abscess, which was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Pus cultures grew Streptococcus faecalis. A search for the underlying cause led to the discovery of an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive search for the underlying cause of pyogenic liver abscesses should be an integral part of the definitive treatment of this disease. After prevailing etiologies have been excluded, silent colonic cancer should be considered.
TI  - Physical mapping of the conjugative bacteriocin plasmid pPD1 of Enterococcus faecalis and identification of the determinant related to the pheromone response.
AB  - The pheromone-responding conjugative bacteriocin plasmid pPD1 (59 kb) of Enterococcus faecalis was mapped physically by using a relational clone approach, and transposon analysis with Tn917 (Emr) or Tn916 (Tcr) facilitated the location of the bacteriocin-related genes in a segment of about 6.7 kb. Tn917 insertions within a 3-kb region resulted in constitutive clumping. The nucleotide sequence of the region that included the insertions giving rise to constitutive clumping was determined. The region of pPD1 spanned about 8 kb and was found to contain a number of open reading frames, some of which were named on the basis of homologies with two other pheromone-responding plasmids, pAD1 and pCF10. The genes were arranged in the sequence repB-repA-traC-traB-traA-ipd-traE-traF- orfY-sea-1 with all but repB and traA oriented in the same (left-to-right) direction. traC and traB corresponded, respectively, to traC and traB of pAD1 and to prgY and prgZ of pCF10.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a region of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pPD1 encoding pheromone inhibitor (ipd), pheromone sensitivity (traC), and pheromone shutdown (traB) genes.
AB  - Bacteriocin plasmid pPD1 in Enterococcus faecalis encodes a mating response to recipient-produced sex pheromone cPD1. Once a recipient acquires pPD1, transconjugants apparently shut off cPD1 activity in broth culture and no longer behave as recipients for pPD1. This event is performed by synthesis of the pheromone inhibitor iPD1 and also by repression of cPD1 production, the so-called "pheromone shutdown." A 5.4-kb EcoRV-HincII segment of pPD1, which expressed iPD1 in Escherichia coli, was sequenced and found to be organized as traC-traB-traA-ipd; each open reading frame is analogous to that found in other pheromone plasmids, pAD1 and pCF10, and thus is designated in accordance with the nomenclature in pAD1. The ipd gene encodes a peptide consisting of 21 amino acids, in which the C-terminal eight residues correspond to iPD1. The putative TraC product has a strong similarity to oligopeptide-binding proteins found in other bacterial species, as do pheromone-binding proteins of pCF10 and pAD1. A strain carrying traC-disrupted pPD1 required a concentration of cPD1 fourfold higher than that needed by the wild-type strain for induction of sexual aggregation. These results suggest that the TraC product contributes to pheromone sensitivity as a pheromone-binding protein. A strain transformed with traB-disrupted pPD1 produced a high level of cPD1 similar to that produced by plasmid-free recipients and underwent self-induction. Thus, the TraB product contributes to cPD1 shutdown.
TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - Microflora associated with percutaneous craniofacial implants used for the retention of facial prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  - Craniofacial implants have been used successfully for the retention of facial prostheses. However, complications occur that can lead to the loss of implant integration. One such complication is infection possibly resulting from crevicular microflora activity. As part of an ongoing study, samples from crevicular sites surrounding 17 craniofacial implants were collected and submitted for microbiological assay. The results demonstrated the presence of opportunistic pathogens in many sites regardless of subjects' hygiene efforts. The significance of the findings is reviewed.
TI  - Improved microbiological assay for folic acid based on microtiter plating with Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We have developed an improved method, using 96-well microtiter plates, for the microbiological assay of folic acid. With this method, the tedium of conventional microbiological analysis is substantially decreased. Culture volumes have been reduced 33-fold, and pipetting procedures have been simplified. Assay time has been reduced to 14 h, and sensitivity has increased 10-fold (0.1 ng/mL). Analytical recoveries range from 98 to 104%. Intra-assay and interassay variabilities are less than 11%. The assay does not require extensive manipulation of inoculum. Day-to-day variability has been minimized by using saline aliquots of the bacterial suspension stored at 4 degrees C. The procedure is accurate, selective, and useful for direct measurement of folic acid in multivitamin formulations.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of BacT/alert standard anaerobic and FAN anaerobic blood culture bottles for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - FAN medium was formulated to improve microbial recovery, particularly for fastidious microorganisms and for microorganisms causing sepsis in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy. In a controlled clinical evaluation performed at four university-affiliated hospitals, FAN anaerobic bottles were compared with standard anaerobic bottles for yield, speed of detection of microbial growth, and detection of septic episodes. A total of 10,431 blood culture sets were received; both anaerobic bottles of 7,694 blood culture sets were adequately filled with blood. Altogether, 925 isolates were recovered: 557 that were the cause of sepsis, 99 that were indeterminate as the cause of sepsis, and 269 contaminants. More Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.001), Escherichia coli (P < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.005) were recovered from FAN bottles; more nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (P < 0.05), Torulopsis glabrata (P < 0.001), and other yeasts (P < 0.01) were recovered from standard bottles. Growth of S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.001), Enterococcus faecalis (P < 0.025), streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae (P < 0.01), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.001) was detected earlier in standard bottles; growth of more isolates of E. coli (P < 0.05) and anaerobic bacteria (P < 0.01) was detected earlier in FAN bottles. The mean times to detection were 14.2 and 16.1 h for standard and FAN bottles, respectively. More septic episodes caused by S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.005), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.02) were detected in FAN bottles; more septic episodes caused by nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (P < 0.025) and yeasts (P < 0.005) were detected in standard bottles. In summary, more isolates (except for strict aerobes) were recovered from FAN bottles than from standard anaerobic bottles. Similarly, significant more septic episodes (except for those caused by strict aerobes) were detected with FAN bottles than with standard anaerobic bottles. With the exception of E. coli and anaerobic bacteria, growth of more isolates was detected earlier in standard anaerobic bottles.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Streptococcal plasmid pIP501 has a functional oriT site.
AB  - DNA sequence analysis suggested the presence of a plasmid transfer origin-like site (oriT) in the gram-positive conjugative plasmid pIP501. To test the hypothesis that the putative oriT site in pIP501 played a role in conjugal transfer, we conducted plasmid mobilization studies in Enterococcus faecalis. Two fragments, 49 and 309 bp, which encompassed the oriT region of pIP501, were cloned into pDL277, a nonconjugative plasmid of gram-positive origin. These recombinant plasmids were mobilized by pVA1702, a derivative of pIP501, at a frequency of 10(-4) to 10(-5) transconjugants per donor cell, while pDL277 was mobilized at a frequency of 10(-8) transconjugants per donor cell. These results indicated that the oriT-like site was needed for conjugal mobilization. To demonstrate precise nicking at the oriT site, alkaline gel and DNA-sequencing analyses were performed. Alkaline gel electrophoresis results indicated a single-stranded DNA break in the predicted oriT site. The oriT site was found upstream of six open reading frames (orf1 to orf6), each of which plays a role in conjugal transfer. Taken together, our conjugal mobilization data and the in vivo oriT nicking seen in Escherichia coli argue compellingly for the role of specific, single-stranded cleavage in plasmid mobilization. Thus, plasmid mobilization promoted by pVA1702 (pIP501) works in a fashion similar to that known to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (ATCC 53103) on the growth of Streptococcus sobrinus in vitro.
AB  - Lactobacillus GG, a recently characterized L. rhamnosus GG strain (ATCC 53103), has been shown to exert inhibitory activity against a variety of bacterial species, including streptococci. We isolated and studied the effect of the inhibitory substance of Lactobacillus GG on some oral streptococci. The inhibitory activity of the isolated substance was weak, but some growth inhibition was observed in Streptococcus sobrinus pretreated with the substance in comparison with untreated controls. Zones of growth inhibition on agar plates were apparent only at pH values below 5, indicating that the inhibitory activity was restricted to a low pH range. Growth curve experiments showed a statistically significant inhibition between series with and without the isolated substance (P < 0.05). The ultrastructure of S. sobrinus was not affected when treated with the inhibitory substance. The Lactobacillus GG itself did not ferment sucrose. The results offer interesting perspectives for future research focusing on the protective function of normal flora and in the attempt to replace harmful bacterial species in oral microflora with less harmful ones.
TI  - The closely related ermB-ermAM genes from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis (pAM beta 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (pIP501) are flanked by variants of a directly repeated sequence.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance gene, ermBP, was sequenced and shown to be identical to the ermB-ermAM gene from the promiscuous Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 and to have at least 98% nucleotide sequence identity to other ermB-ermAM genes. Flanking the ermBP structural gene were almost identical directly repeated 1,341-bp sequences (DR1 and DR2). These repeats potentially encoded a 298 (or 284)-amino-acid protein that had sequence similarity to chromosomal and plasmid partitioning proteins. The pAM beta 1 and Streptococcus agalactiae (pIP501) erm determinants appeared to have DR2 but had similar internal 973- or 956-bp deletions in DR1, respectively. Some of the other ermB-ermAM class determinants had small portions of DR1, but none had complete copies. It is postulated that the C. perfringens ermBP determinant was derived from an enterococcal or streptococcal determinant that had complete copies of both DR1 and DR2.

AB  
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. Potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  - The palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for Gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. We find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good Gram positive activity. For 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. There is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the Gram positive activity, particularly for S. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. The MIC50 value for the most potent agents in this study against S. aureus ATCC 29213 is 0.008 microgram/mL. By comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/mL, respectively, against this organism.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the tetL gene and identification  of iso-ISS1 elements from Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1.
AB  - The tetracycline-resistance (TcR) determinant of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb RsaI-EcoRI fragment. The fragment was cloned in Escherichia coli, and specified TcR in this host. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1374 bp, designated tetL. The nt sequence of tetL from pJH1 was identical to that of the tetL present on pLS1 from Streptococcus agalactiae. Upstream of the pJH1 tetL, part of another ORF was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-ISS1 element from Lactococcus lactis. Hybridization studies indicated the presence of several ISS1-like elements in plasmid pJH1, but not on the En. faecalis chromosome. To study its usefulness as a marker in Gram+ organisms, the pJH1 tetL was cloned on the broad-host-range plasmid pNZ124, resulting in pNZ280, that was found to give resistance to 40 micrograms Tc/ml in Lc. lactis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of the new 4-quinolones DU-6859a and DV-7751a.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, DU-6859a and DV-7751a, was investigated against strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. DU-6859a and DV-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. Furthermore, DU-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill Ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. The bactericidal mechanisms of DV-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, DU-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both Str. pneumoniae and Ent. faecalis. This may explain the unusually potent bactericidal activity of this agent against these species. These results show that DU-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.
TI  - Sepsis in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The Madrid HIV Pediatric Infection Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - The aims of this retrospective study were to review the frequency and patterns of bacterial sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The charts of 233 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children cared for during a 10-year period in 4 tertiary hospitals in Madrid were reviewed. There were 43 episodes of sepsis in 31 (13%) children. Twenty of them had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 10 were class PA2 and 1 was class P1B. The most common organisms recovered were: nontyphoidal Salmonella, 10 cases (23%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 cases (21%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6 cases (14%); Escherichia coli, 5 cases (12%); Enterococcus faecalis, 4 cases (9%); Campylobacter jejuni, 2 cases (5%). In 28 episodes of bacteremia there were other sites of associated infection: pneumonia, 6 cases; urinary tract infection (UTI), 5 cases; gastrointestinal disease, 4 cases; catheter-related bacteremia, 12 cases. Eight patients had more than 1 episode of bacteremia. The rate of complications was high: 6 children had septic shock; and 2 of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. There was 1 death directly related to sepsis.
TI  - Bacteriologic, histologic and ultrasonographic findings in strictures recurring after urethrotomy. A preliminary study.
AB  - Twelve men with recurrent anterior urethral stricture after endoscopic urethrotomy (2-12 attempts) underwent open urethroplasty with en bloc removal of diseased urethral segments. Bacteriologic and histologic studies of the excised urethral tracts (mucosa and spongiosum tissue) were performed. The bacteriologic findings were compared with the results of preoperative urine cultures and urethral swabs for chlamydia. The histologic findings were related to preoperative ultrasonographic observations, in order to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography in depicting structural changes in spongiosum around the strictured urethral tract. Beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured from the excised spongiosum, without correlation to the preoperative culture results. The histologic studies confirmed the usefulness of urethral ultrasonography for accurate demonstration of the inflammatory changes involving spongiosum around the strictures.
TI  - Quinone reductase reaction catalyzed by Streptococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase.
AB  - NADH peroxidase is a flavoenzyme having a single redox-active thiol, Cys42, that  cycles between sulfenate and thiol forms in the NADH-dependent reduction of hydrogen peroxide. NADH peroxidase catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of quinones with turnover numbers between 1.2 and 3.9 s-1, per mole of FAD, at pH 7.5. The bimolecular rate constants for quinone reduction, V/K, ranged from 4.3 x 10(3) to 6.0 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 for 14 quinones whose redox potentials varied between -0.41 and 0.09 V. The logarithms of the V/K values for these quinones are hyperbolically dependent on their single-electron reduction potentials (E7(1). One-electron reduction of benzoquinone accounts for about 50% of the total electron transfer catalyzed by NADH peroxidase at pH 7, with the remainder of the reduction being catalyzed by a two-electron (hydride) transfer. Cys42 can be irreversibly oxidized to the sulfonate by hydrogen peroxide, with inactivation of the peroxidatic activity of the enzyme. The residual quinone reductase activity of NADH peroxidase which has undergone oxidative inactivation of the active site Cys42 indicates that this residue is not involved in the reduction of the quinones. Product inhibition studies suggest the possibility of overlap of the pyridine nucleotide and quinone binding sites in the reduced enzyme at low pH values. The pH dependence of the maximum velocity of naphthoquinone reduction shows that deprotonation of an enzymic group, exhibiting a pK value of ca. 6.2, decreases the maximal velocity. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on V and V/K for quinone-dependent NADH oxidation increase upon protonation of a group, exhibiting a pK value of 6.4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Anti-mutagenic and immuno-stimulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L. rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and En. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA97. The mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees C for 15 min were ineffective. In vitro, En. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. Similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and heat-inactivated bacteria.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - Development of a direct viable count procedure for some gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The direct viable count (DVC) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. It should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only Gram-negative species, mainly because the DVC procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of Gram-positive bacteria since the DVC procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. The authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable Gram-positive bacteria. To facilitate a differential DVC for Gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. These antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they are DNA gyrase inhibitors. The concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000 micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. Pure cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the University of Wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the Laramie wastewater treatment plant. An antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. The antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged cells in the DVC procedure varied between organisms.
TI  - [The isolation of Streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  - We have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by Gynecology Service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. We achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58 (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to Streptococcus morbillorum 9 (15.5%), to Gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to Enterococcus faecalis-durans and to Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to Streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to Streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to Streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis II respectively. We previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. The bacteriological identification done by the API 20 STREP System (bioMerieux GmbH, Nutingen, Germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.
AB  - A gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified in a genomic library of the strain in pUC19 by screening Escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity on a medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells. In cell extracts of L. lactis MG1363 and several halo-producing E. coli transformants, lytic bands of similar sizes were identified by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels containing L. lactis or M. lysodeikticus cell walls. Of these clearing bands, corresponding to the presence of lytic enzymes with sizes of 46 and 41 kDa, the 41-kDa band was also present in the supernatant of an L. lactis culture. Deletion analysis of one of the recombinant plasmids showed that the information specifying lytic activity was contained within a 2,428-bp EcoRV-Sau3A fragment. Sequencing of part of this fragment revealed a gene (acmA) that could encode a polypeptide of 437 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass of AcmA (46,564 Da) corresponded to that of one of the lytic activities detected. Presumably, the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by cleavage after the Ala at position 57, thus producing a mature protein with a size of 40,264 Da, which would correspond to the size of the enzyme whose lytic activity was present in culture supernatants of L. lactis. The N-terminal region of the mature protein showed 60% identity with the N-terminal region of the mature muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae and the autolysin of Streptococcus faecalis. Like the latter two enzymes, AcmA contains C-terminal repeated regions. In AcmA, these three repeats are separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences highly enriched in serine, threonine, and asparagine. Genes specifying identical activities were detected in various strains of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detection assay and PCR experiments. By replacement recombination, an acmA deletion mutant which grew as long chains was constructed, indicating that AcmA is required for cell separation.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - In vitro activity of RP 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) against antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci.
AB  - The activity of RP 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) was evaluated in vitro against antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (N = 15) and Enterococcus spp. (N = 43). By broth dilution MIC tests RP 59500 was highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, but showed poor activity against E. faecalis. In time-kill studies the drug was rapidly bactericidal against S. pneumoniae but failed to kill most enterococci, even in the presence of gentamicin or human serum.
TI  - Cloning of an Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis antigen: homology with adhesins  from some oral streptococci.
AB  - Serum from a patient with Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis was used to identify the gene efaA cloned in Lambda ZapII in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 924-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,768. The amino acid sequence of EfaA shows 55 to 60% homology to a group of streptococcal proteins, FimA from Streptococcus parasanguis, SsaB from Streptococcus sanguis, ScaA from Streptococcus gordonii, and PsaA from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Members of this group have been shown to be adhesins, and we hypothesize that EfaA may function as an adhesin in endocarditis.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies were carried out on SY5555, a new oral penem, in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. The clinical efficacies were examined in a total 31 patients consisting of 4 patients with pharyngitis, 10 with purulent tonsillitis, 4 with scarlet fever, 7 with impetigo, one with balanitis, one with cellulitis and 4 with UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 96.8% (30/31). Bacteriological efficacies of SY5555 were examined on identified pathogens including 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 of Haemophilus influenzae, one of Escherichia coli and one of Citrobacter freundii. The bacteriological eradication rate was 81.0%. As for side effects, loose stool in one patient was noted. Abnormal laboratory findings test results included eosinophilia in 2 patients, eosinophilia and elevation of serum transaminase in one patient, and thrombocytosis in another.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - [The present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and M. tuberculosis].
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. The resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in S. aureus and S. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of DNA, namely by gene mecA. This gene codes altered PBP-2A protein. Strains of S.pneumoniae contain PBP-1A, PBP-2B and PBP-2X proteins. They cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium is coded by transferable vanA and vanB genes. Strains of N. meningitidis produce mostly the altered PBP-2 protein. The increase of resistance in strains of M. tuberculosis is also significant.

TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Survey of urease activity in ruminal bacteria isolated from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  - A total of 909 strains, including Selenomonas ruminantium, Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp., from the rumen of 104 domestic and wild ruminants was used in tests for urease activity. Tests showed that 56.7% of S. ruminantium strains and 18.5% of lactobacilli manifested medium urease activity with mean values of 14.4 +/- 2.5 and 13.85 +/- 0.25 nkat ml-1, respectively. Most of the Enterococcus faecium (62.2%) and all of the E. faecalis isolates expressed urease activity with mean values of 3.9 +/- 0.05 and 4.1 +/- 0.06 nkat ml-1. E. malodoratus, E. solitarius, E. mundtii, Streptococcus bovis and S. uberis did not produce any urease. All the staphylococci screened were urease-producing strains, mostly with medium or low urease activity. The highest level of urease was measured in the rumen epithelial wall of isolates SE30 (19.7 +/- 2.71 nkat ml-1 of rumen content), SCU32 (29.3 +/- 1.6 nkat ml-1) and also in the rumen content isolates EF35 (19.9 +/- 0.94 nkat ml-1) and S. ruminantium 77 (25.35 nkat ml-1). This survey contributes new data to existing information relating to the ureolytic microbial ecosystem in ruminants.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical material to ciprofloxacin].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of bacteria  species isolated from different specimens of clinical materials. The investigated strains (830) were identified using conventional methods. The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied by the method of drug dilution in Mueller-Hinton agar. Among aerobic bacteria, only 5 strains (0.6%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin in concentration 4 micrograms/ml; two belonged to E. coli species, two to S. aureus and one was a Streptococcus group B., Corynebacterium sp. MIC90 = 0.12 microgram/ml turned out to be most resistant, next, Gram-negative rods MIC90 = 0.5 microgram/ml, coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci and Neisseria sp. MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml. Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobes were the least susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Their MIC90 was 2 and 16 micrograms/ml respectively. Among 20 anaerobic strains, up to 10 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, mainly from Bacteroides and Clostridium genus.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on SY5555 in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555 were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 15 patients considered to have bacterial infections were treated with SY5555. Each dose, 5 mg/kg, was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-11 days. Clinical efficacies of SY5555 in 13 patients with bacterial infections (1 with pneumonia, 2 with bronchitis, each 1 with maxillary sinusitis, 2 with otitis media, 5 with pharyngitis, 1 each with gastroenteritis and pyelonephritis) were evaluated as excellent in 10 patients and as good in 3 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Two patients with viral infection and malignant lymphoma were not evaluated. Thirteen causative strains in 7 species were found in 10 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1/3, Haemophilus influenzae in 2/2, Streptococcus pyogenes 4/4, Salmonella spp. in 1/1, Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Only one patient developed mild diarrhea as an adverse reaction. Another patient showed elevated GPT (glutamate pyruvate transaminase). The abnormality was mild and the patient recovered after the cessation of SY5555 administration without specific treatment. 2. MICs of SY5555 were examined against 33 clinical isolates. SY5555 has low MICs against Enterococcus faecalis and other Gram-positive cocci. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak plasma concentrations of SY5555 was 1.15 micrograms/ml at a dose level of 4.9 mg/kg orally administered at fasting. Based on the above results and the broad spectrum of the anti-bacterial activities, SY5555 appears to be a promising antibiotics that is usable as a single agent for the primary therapy of respiratory tract infections, skin soft tissue infections and urinary tract infections in children.
TI  - Characterization of an erythromycin resistance (erm) plasmid in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Three erythromyxin-resistant Swedish isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, representing different T-types, were studied. Two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (MIC > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (MIC 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. In each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated Mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. The three plasmids pSE701, pSE702, and pSE703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. Novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain ER559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pSE703. Furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. One of the plasmids, pSE702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within S. pyogenes. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that the resistance determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid pAM beta 1 of Enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pE194 of Staphylococcus aureus. The copy numbers of pSE702 and pSE703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1 for pSE701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. The plasmids pSE702 and pAM beta 1 showed about 80% homology in DNA-DNA hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.
TI  - Use of cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar for selective isolation of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA), a new selective agar, was examined in  comparison with nalidixic acid-colistin agar for the differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from other enterococci and the ability to isolate the organism from feces. Two hundred sixteen enterococcus isolates and a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative control strains were inoculated onto both media. All control strains of E. faecium were easily differentiated from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus durans on the basis of arabinose fermentation on CAA. Differentiation of E. faecium from other enterococci or Streptococcus bovis was not possible on nalidixic acid-colistin agar. Increased isolation of E. faecium was demonstrated on CAA when both media were compared for the isolation of the organism from feces. CAA has been shown to possess excellent differential and selective features allowing the simple and effective isolation of E. faecium from heavily contaminated sites.
TI  - Positive inotropic effect of Streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. Because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. Bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees C, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in Krebs-Ringer solution (1.25 mM Ca2+, 35 degrees C). The endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (TT) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (Vmax) and significant decreases in time to TT (TtTT) and time to half isometric twitch tension decline (RT 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. This response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with KIO4. Increasing Ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. Propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on TT and Vmax while abolishing the effects on TtTT and on RT 1/2. By contrast, Streptococcus bovis and Staphylococcus aureus did not affect TT or Vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in TtTT at the highest concentration of bacteria. Accordingly, the filtrate of Strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. The active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. Strep. bovis and Staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. We determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. Antibacterial activity MICs of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and CZOP were determined against a total of 19 strains. For Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CZOP ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). These MICs were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the MIC of CZOP against E. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. For Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of CZOP were 25 micrograms/ml against Citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, MICs of CZOP against Haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the MIC of CZOP against Serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and CZOP was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. Pharmacokinetics CZOP was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the bioassay. Serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. The corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the AUCs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. The rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. The concentrations in the CSF determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the CSF/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. These values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using HPLC. 3. Clinical evaluation Forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. Of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae in southwest Germany as determined by the E test.
AB  - We have studied the prevalence of anti-microbial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Southwest Germany. One hundred seventy-four clinical isolates of pneumococci collected from hospitalized patients between October 1992 and April 1994 were used for MIC determinations. MICs for penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and rifampicin were assessed by the E test. Eleven of the 174 strains (6.3%) were intermediately resistant to penicillin (MIC between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml) and four of the 174 strains (2.3%) were intermediately resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml). All four isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone also demonstrated intermediate resistance to penicillin. Six of the 174 strains (3.5%) were highly resistant (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml) to erythromycin. Resistance to rifampicin was not observed. Our results demonstrate that pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and erythromycin has increased markedly in Germany over the last decade. Our findings underline the need for continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Biological properties of IRM with the addition of hydroxyapatite as a retrograde  root filling material.
AB  - The effect of adding 10% & 20% hydroxyapatite (HAP) on the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of IRM (Intermediate Restorative Material) when used as a retrograde root filling was compared with amalgam, a commonly used material. The antibacterial activity was assessed using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. Forty standardized pellets of each material were produced. Fresh materials, and materials aged for 1 week in sterile distilled water, were placed on blood agar plates inoculated with Streptococcus anginosus (milleri) or Enterococcus faecalis. The presence and diameter of zones of inhibition were recorded at intervals of 3, 7 and 10 days. There was no statistically significant overall difference in the response of the two bacteria tested. However, there were statistically significant overall differences in diameters of the zones of inhibition related to different materials, period of exposure and ageing of materials (P < 0.001). The diameter of the zones of inhibition increased with time for all materials, fresh and aged. IRM and both the HAP-modified forms produced large zones of inhibition. Amalgam produced no measureable zones of inhibition whether aged or fresh, regardless of period of exposure and was different from the other materials (P < 0.001). The cytotoxicity was assessed using the Millipore filter method. Ten standardized pellets of each material were produced and aged by storage in sterile distilled water for 72 h. Ten filters were included as controls. Amalgam produced a consistent cytotoxic score of 1, and the difference between amalgam and the other materials was statistically significant (P < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Presence of the Listeria tetracycline resistance gene tet(S) in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Two hundred thirty-eight tetracycline- and minocycline-resistant clinical isolates of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. were investigated by dot blot hybridization for the presence of nucleotide sequences related to tet(S) (first detected in Listeria monocytogenes BM4210), tet(K), tet(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(P), and tet(Q) genes. The tet(S) determinant was found in 22 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, associated with tet(M) in 9 of these isolates and further associated with tet(L) in 3 of these strains. tet(M) was detected in all strains of Streptococcus spp. and in all but 10 isolates of Enterococcus spp.; tet(L) was found in 93 enterococci and tet(O) was found in single isolates of E. faecalis and Streptococcus milleri. No hybridization with the tet(K), tet(P), and tet(Q) probes was observed. Transfer of tet(S) by conjugation to E. faecalis or to E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes was obtained from 8 of the 10 E. faecalis strains harboring only this tet gene. Hybridization experiments with DNAs of four donors and of the corresponding transconjugants suggested that tet(S) was located in the chromosome. These results indicate that the genetic support of tet(S) in E. faecalis is different from that in L. monocytogenes, where it is carried by self-transferable plasmids, and confirm the notion of exchange of genetic information between Enterococcus and Listeria spp. in nature.
TI  - Heterogeneric conjugal transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 (IncHlyI) of Enterococcus faecalis in the apparent absence of pheromone induction.
AB  - Erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 from Enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. This was done by inserting the integrative vector pAT112 and the related replicon pTCR1 harboring oriR of the broad host range plasmid pAM beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pIP964, to give pTCR2 and pTCR3, respectively. Plasmid pTCR2 was transferred by filter matings from E. faecalis to Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. In these hosts, pTCR2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. Plasmid pTCR3, but not pTCR2, was transferred at similar frequencies from E. faecalis to Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Thus, the transfer system of pIP964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.
TI  - Resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-positive bacteria has reemerged in the last decade as a major clinical problem. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and enterococci resistant to penicillin, vancomycin, and/or gentamicin have become new considerations in the selection of therapy. Both mutation and acquisition of new DNA on either the chromosome or plasmids can be responsible for resistance in Gram-positive species. Because therapies are often limited, renewed efforts are needed to understand the epidemiology in order to effect control.
TI  - N,N-dimethylglycyl-amido derivative of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-desoxytetracycline, two new glycylcyclines highly effective against tetracycline-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the N,N-dimethylglycyl-amino derivative of minocycline (DMG-MINO) and 6-dimethyl-6-dexoxytetracycline (DMG-DMDOT), members of a new generation of tetracyclines, were evaluated by an agar dilution method and were compared with those of tetracycline and minocycline against 224 tetracycline-resistant and 73 tetracycline-susceptible recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci, including multiple-antibiotic-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs of DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT were up to 500- to 2,000-fold lower than those of tetracycline against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 50% of strains tested [MIC50], < 0.06 microgram/ml). Against Streptococcus groups A, B, C, and G and Enterococcus faecalis, the MIC50 was 0.5 microgram/ml. MIC50s were greater only for coagulase-negative staphylococci (2 micrograms/ml). These data indicate that DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT are very potent drugs, and further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O2-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans induces both H2O2-forming and H2O-forming NADH oxidases in the presence of O2 [M. Higuchi, J. Gen. Microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. In this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (NOX-1) from Streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 Da. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the purified NOX-1 protein. The nox-1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of NOX-1 with those of NADH oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of Amphibacillus xylanus Ep01, Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, Thermoanaerobium brockii Rt8.G4, and Thermus thermophilus HB8, respectively.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - Isolation and identification by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry of the carbonyl-active site of pig kidney diamine oxidase.
AB  - An adduct with phenylhydrazine was formed with the purified pig kidney diamine oxidase and in parallel with the l-tyrosine decarboxylase from Streptococcus faecalis. The labeled enzymes were hydrolyzed by chemical hydrolysis and the adducts released by hydrolysis were isolated and identified first in HPLC and successively in GC-MS. Both enzymes gave the same adduct which was identified as the phenylhydrazone of pyridoxal. The isolated adduct had the same retention time as the phenylhydrazone of pyridoxal in HPLC and in gas chromatography and showed the same molecular weight in mass spectrometry when chemical ionization was used and the same fragmentation in mass spectrometry when electronic impact was used. The reported results show that pig kidney diamine oxidase contains pyridoxal in the form of covalently linked pyridoxal phosphate which can be released from the enzyme only by chemical hydrolysis. Pig kidney diamine oxidase is therefore a pyridoxal enzyme such as l-tyrosine decarboxylase as hypothesized in the past but never clearly demonstrated.
TI  - An in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  - Whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. This investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. sanguis, Strep. vestibularis and Enterococcus faecalis in comparison with Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. In the presence of a 146 mM sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in pH were measured. It was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with E. faecalis, Strep. gordonii, Strep. sanguis exhibiting low, Strep. vestibularis intermediate, and Strep. mutans and Strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. This assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new carbapenem antibiotic, biapenem (L-627), in the pediatric field].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. L-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, L-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: Cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, T 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. Adverse reactions were minimal. These data suggest that L-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections due to multiply resistant bacteria.
TI  - Identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was the most frequent Streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of Strep. dysgalactiae. The intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of Strep. bovis, Strep. hyointestinalis and Strep. suis. Many of these intestinal Strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. Nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as Strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. This species was not found in tonsils and intestines but was about equally prevalent as Strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. Other streptococci were rare in this material. Enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. In intestinal samples Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Ent. cecorum were most frequently found. In faeces Ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. The characteristics of the less well known species Strep. alactolyticus and Strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines for their differentiation from Strep. bovis and Strep. suis given.
TI  - Characterization of antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Twenty one isolates of Streptococcus suis were screened for antibiotic resistance by growth on antibiotic-containing media, by measuring minimum inhibitory concentrations, by hybridization to specific DNA and oligonucleotide probes for antibiotic resistance genes, and by PCR. The isolates were from a slaughter house survey of respiratory pathogens in Norwegian pigs in 1986. Fifteen isolates were resistant to tetracycline, with MICs ranging from 4-128 micrograms/ml. Genes coding for the Tet O and Tet M determinants were detected in eight and five isolates, respectively. Genes coding for other Gram positive Tet determinants, Tet K, Tet L, and Tet P, were not detected. One isolate was constitutive resistant to erythromycin with MIC of 128 micrograms/ml. Five other isolates carried inducible erythromycin resistance. All these isolates, and five others, were positive in a PCR assay for erythromycin resistance, and hybridized with the Erm C and/or Erm B probes. No resistance against chloramphenicol (5 micrograms/ml) or rifampin (10 micrograms/ml) could be could be detected, but five isolates were resistant to streptomycin (250 micrograms/ml), four isolates were resistant to kanamycin (10 micrograms/ml), and one isolate was resistant to fusicic acid (10 micrograms/ml). In mating experiments with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 as recipient, tetracycline, erythromycin, and kanamycin genes were transferred separately to the recipient strain at a rate of 10(-7) transconjugants/recipient cell.
TI  - Displacement of Enterococcus faecalis from hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrata  by Lactobacillus and Streptococcus spp. as studied in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  - The displacement of Enterococcus faecalis 1131 from hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrata by isolates of Lactobacillus casei 36 and Streptococcus hyointestinalis KM1 was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber. The experiments were conducted with either 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer or human urine as the suspending fluid, and adhesion and displacement were measured by real-time in situ image analysis. The results showed that E. faecalis 1131 was displaced by lactobacilli (31%) and streptococci (74%) from fluorinated ethylene propylene in buffer and that displacement by lactobacilli was even more effective on a glass substratum in urine (54%). The passage of an air-liquid interface significantly impacted on adhesion, especially when the surface had been challenged with lactobacilli (up to 100% displacement) or streptococci (up to 94% displacement). These results showed that the parallel plate flow system with real-time in situ image analysis was effective for studying bacterial adhesion and that uropathogenic enterococci can be displaced by indigenous bacteria.
TI  - Gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) CFU/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) CFU/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) CFU/ml for 75% of the samples. The 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), E. faecium (16), E. avium (7), E. durans (4), Aerococcus viridans (10), Streptococcus morbillorum (2), S. salivarius (1), S. sanguis (1), S. "milleri" (1), S. pneumoniae (1), S. acidominimus (1), and Gemella haemolysans (1). These species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. Their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). A count of the Gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - In vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. A total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference was seen with Proteus spp.). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 16 micrograms/ml). Tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml). Streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). The glycylcyclines were highly potent against Neisseria, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). Strains of Chlamydia spp. (three C. trachomatis strains and one C. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of CL 329,998 or CL 331,002 per ml. Two strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of CL 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of CL 329,998 per ml. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were resistant to the two glycylcyclines (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Structural comparison of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr.
AB  - The phosphocarrier protein HPr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) that is responsible for carbohydrate uptake in many bacterial species. A number of three-dimensional structures of HPrs from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been determined; the overall folding topology of HPr is an open-faced beta-sandwich composed of three alpha-helices and a beta-sheet. A detailed structural comparison of these HPrs has been carried out. Besides the overall main chain folding, many detailed structural features are well conserved in all HPr structures. The three x-ray structures of HPrs from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis show considerable overall similarity with respect to the positions of the C alpha atoms. A significant structural difference between HPrs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is found in the region of Gly54, owing to the steric effects of Tyr37 in HPrs from the Gram-positive species. The region around Gly54 is involved in the binding of HPr to other PTS proteins and the differences in this region may be responsible for some of the poor functional complementation between HPrs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. The active center region, residues 12-18, appears to have significant differences in the comparisons between the overall structures. These differences support the proposal that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the active site His15 is accompanied by conformational changes. However, a local structural comparison of residues 12-18 from the x-ray structures of HPrs from E. coli and B. subtilis, and the two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of B. subtilis HPr suggests that there is a conserved active center involving residues His15, Arg 17, and Pro18, which shows little conformational change during the phosphorylation cycle. The results of other experimental approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy, are in some cases difficult to rationalize with some of the details of the structures, but do appear to favour the conclusion that little conformational change occurs.
TI  - The Enterococcus faecalis extracellular metalloendopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.30; coccolysin) inactivates human endothelin at bonds involving hydrophobic amino acid residues.
AB  - The extracellular metalloendopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.30; coccolysin) from Enterococcus faecalis (Strain OG1-10) inactivates human endothelin-1 by hydrolyzing the peptide primarily at the Ser5-Leu6 and the His16-Leu17 bonds and the human big endothelin at several bonds involving hydrophobic amino acid residues. The big endothelin fragment 22-38 was also hydrolyzed at a high rate. The degradation of endothelin by coccolysin resembles the peptidolytic processing of endothelin by thermolysin. Because E. faecalis is associated with a large number of infectious diseases, it is possible that the manifestation of inflammatory conditions in the presence of this organism is related to the coccolysin-catalyzed inactivation of endothelin.
TI  - Comparison of sterility profiles from slaughterhouse versus surgically removed pancreata for islet isolation with a new semiclosed method involving the COBE 2991.
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of potential retrograde root filling materials.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of potential retrograde root filling materials was assessed using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. A light-cured glass ionomer cement (Vitrebond) and three reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cements (Kalzinol, IRM & ethoxybenzoic acid [EBA] cement) were compared with amalgam, a commonly used retrograde root filling material. Forty standardized pellets of each material were produced. Fresh, and materials aged for 1 week in sterile distilled water, were placed on blood agar plates inoculated with Streptococcus anginosus (milleri) or Enterococcus faecalis. At intervals of 3, 7 and 10 days, the presence and diameter of zones of inhibition were recorded. The diameter of the zones of inhibition increased with time for all materials, both fresh and aged. Vitrebond had the most pronounced antibacterial activity against both bacteria, producing the largest zone of inhibition, followed by Kalzinol. Amalgam had no measurable inhibitory effect whether aged or fresh, regardless of the period of exposure. There was no statistically significant difference in the response of the two bacteria. However, there were statistically significant differences between materials, period of exposure, and between fresh and aged materials (P < 0.001). Kalzinol, IRM and EBA cement were more antibacterial when aged than fresh, whilst Vitrebond was more active when fresh. Vitrebond was the only material for which the diameter of the zones of inhibition was reduced after ageing but it had the most pronounced antibacterial activity compared with the other materials. The antibacterial activity of the materials was ranked in the following order: Vitrebond > Kalzinol > (IRM = EBA cement) > amalgam.
TI  - Molecules of Streptococcus gordonii that bind to Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as Streptococcus gordonii. In this study, the molecules of S. gordonii G9B that mediate binding to P. gingivalis were investigated. Biotinylated surface molecules of S. gordonii were extracted and mixed with P. gingivalis cells. Interactive streptococcal components were identified by SDS-PAGE of the P. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. S. gordonii molecules of 45 kDa and a doublet of 62/60 kDa were observed to bind to P. gingivalis. Polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kDa proteins inhibited the binding interaction. These antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kDa molecules and the 45 kDa protein. Both molecules were also antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of 170 kDa which is antigenically related to the P1 antigen of S. mutans. Cloning and expression in Enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the P1-like molecule from S. gordonii M5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kDa and 45 kDa antigens and was capable of binding to P. gingivalis. These results suggest that a P1-like molecule in S. gordonii is involved in adherence to P. gingivalis. Processing of the P1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kDa and 45 kDa may be required for binding activity.
TI  - The 1.6 A structure of histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein HPr from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) is a central component of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) that transports carbohydrates across the cell membrane of bacteria. The three-dimensional structure of Gram-positive Streptococcus faecalis HPr has been determined using the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. The R factor for all data is 0.156 for S. faecalis HPr at 1.6 A resolution with very good geometry. The overall folding topology of HPr is a classical open-faced beta-sandwich, consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices. Remarkable disallowed Ramachandran torsion angles of Ala16 at the active center, revealed by the X-ray structure of S. faecalis HPr, demonstrate a unique example of torsion-angle strain that is likely involved directly in protein function. A brief report concerning the torsion-angle strain has been presented recently. A newly-determined pH 7.0 structure is shown to have the same open conformation of the active center and the same torsion-angle strain at Ala16, suggesting that pH is not responsible for the structural observations. The current structure suggests a role for residues 12 and 51 in HPr's function, since they are involved in the active center through direct and indirect hydrogen-bonding interactions with the imidazole ring of His15. It is found that Ser46, the regulatory site in HPr from Gram-positive bacteria, N-caps the minor alpha-B helix and is also involved in the Asn43-Ser46 beta-turn. This finding, in conjunction with the proposed routes of communication between the regulatory site Ser46 and the active center in S. faecalis HPr, provides new insight into the understanding of how Ser46 might function. The putative involvement of the C-terminal alpha-carboxyl group and the related Gly67-Glu70 reverse beta-turn with respect to the function of HPr are described.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against a wide variety of clinical isolates was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones. The MICs of AM-1155 for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were 0.10, 0.39, and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes was comparable to those of sparfloxacin and tosufloxacin. AM-1155 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 0.39 microgram/ml. AM-1155 generally had activity comparable to that of sparfloxacin against gram-negative bacteria. AM-1155 showed moderate activity against methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. AM-1155 demonstrated bactericidal activity at the MIC. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutants resistant to four times the MIC of AM-1155 was < 1 x 10(9) for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AM-1155 strongly inhibited the supercoiling activities of DNA gyrases purified from E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of crude extracts of Mitracarpus villosus.
AB  - Mature leaves and inflorescence of Mitracarpus villosus, collected from Niger State, Nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a Waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. The crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. The extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. The ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Kri 1 paste and zinc oxide-eugenol used in primary tooth pulpectomies.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Kri 1 paste, an iodoform-based primary tooth filling material, were compared with zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE), using in vitro techniques. Antimicrobial evaluation involved measuring inhibition zones of Streptococcus faecalis on brain heart agar. Cytotoxicity evaluation involved direct cell-medicament contact experiments of 4-hr and 24-hr duration using fresh and set medicaments, and indirect cell-medicament contact experiments of 24-hr duration using fresh and set medicaments. ZOE produced a greater zone of bacterial inhibition than Kri 1 paste. Kri 1 paste cytotoxicity remained high regardless of the amount of setting time in the 4-hr direct contact experiment, while ZOE cytotoxicity decreased with setting time. Both Kri 1 paste and ZOE had high cytotoxicity regardless of setting time in the 24-hr direct cell-medicament contact test. ZOE cytotoxicity decreased to control levels after only 1 day of setting in the indirect contact experiments, compared with greater than 7 days for Kri 1 paste. The results suggest ZOE has better antimicrobial activity than Kri 1 paste. ZOE also has lower cytotoxicity, although prolonged cell-medicament contact may result in both medicaments having similarly high cytotoxicity.
TI  - [Antibiotic activities of cefpirome against fresh clinical isolates resistant to  multiple drugs].
AB  - Using multiple drug-resistant clinical isolates isolated since September 1992, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpirome (CPR) were determined. Several control drugs were also used, and these MIC-determinations were made to determine the antibiotic activity of CPR. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Antibiotic activities of CPR against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and benzylpenicillin-insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae showed that expanded antibacterial spectrum of CPR and its enhanced antibiotic action against Gram-positive bacteria. We suggest that among the existing fourth-generation cephem antibiotics, CPR is "characteristically strong against Gram-positive bacteria". 2. Strong antibiotic activities of CPR were recognized against bacteria of family Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the third-generation cephems. The strong antibiotic activities appeared to be due to CPR's stability and decreased affinity for beta-lactamase. 3. Antibacterial spectrum of CPR was expanded against non-glucose fermented Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It appears that this expansion of antibacterial spectrum is due to CPR's affinities for a wide range of penicillin-binding proteins as well as its improved permeability into tissues.
TI  - Survey of bacteraemia in a Spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  - The aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a Spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. A total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). A slight increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. The most frequent species (annual range) were: Escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), Klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). Males were more affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). The portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). Bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. The hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pGT633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermGT) from Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pGT633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) type B antibiotics. The restriction endonucleases AccI, BamHI, BclI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HhaI, HindII, HpaI, KpnI, SalI, and SspI were employed to establish a physical map of pGT633. Next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of pGT633. The results revealed that pGT633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including Bacillus subtilis BD170, Streptococcus sanguis DL1, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several Lactobacillus spp. A 2.2 kb BamHI fragment of pGT633 containing the genetic determinant (ermGT) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermGT revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermC gene from S. aureus plasmid pE194. The leader sequences of ermGT and ermC were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.
TI  - Genetic and molecular studies of a composite chromosomal element (Tn3705) containing a Tn916-modified structure (Tn3704) in Streptococcus anginosus F22.
AB  - The plasmid-free Streptococcus anginosus F22 contained a conjugative element, Tn3705, encoding resistance to erythromycin (Emr) and tetracycline-minocycline (Tcr-Mnr). We mapped a chromosomal region (> 52 kb) of F22, corresponding to the internal part of Tn3705. Molecular analysis of Tn3705 revealed it to be a composite structure: it included in its central part a transposon designated Tn3704 (20.3 kb +/- 0.5 kb), which had a modified structure in comparison with that of Tn916 and on which the Emr Tcr-Mn4 markers were localized. Tn3705 inserted from F22 into the chromosome of various streptococcal transconjugants as well as that of Enterococcus faecalis transconjugants without changing its structure. In contrast, from the chromosome of an E. faecalis::Tn3705 transconjugant only Tn3704 inserted, at various sites, into another E. faecalis chromosome. Sugar fermentations occurred after the insertion of Tn3704 into the chromosome of an asaccharolytic E. faecalis strain. Transposition of only Tn3704 from the chromosome of E. faecalis::Tn3705 onto pIP964, an E. faecalis hemolysin plasmid, yielded two different pIP964 derivatives. The size of the entire element Tn3705 was estimated to be about 70.0 kb by pulsed-field electrophoresis.
TI  - The promiscuous plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from gram-positive bacteria encode complementary resolution functions.
AB  - pIP501 and pAM beta 1 are promiscuous plasmids from gram-positive bacteria which  carry structurally and genetically related replication functions (L. Janniere, A. Gruss and S.D. Ehrlich, 1993, in "Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics (A.L. Sonenshein, J.A. Hoch, and R. Losick, Eds.), pp. 625-644). We report here the sequence of a approximately 1 kb region located downstream of the pIP501 minimal replicon. This region is 82% homologous to the corresponding region of pAM beta 1 and encodes a resolution system which complements that of pAM beta 1. Additionally, we present evidence that the structural similarity between the two plasmids extends for further approximately 2 kb, through a region which may encode a topoisomerase protein in pAM beta 1.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Characterization of a Tn925-induced mutant of Staphylococcus aureus altered in exoprotein production.
AB  - An insertional mutant was isolated from a bovine Staphylococcus aureus strain after membrane-mating with a Streptococcus faecalis strain carrying conjugative plasmid pCF10::Tn925. This mutant, designated RC128, showed enhanced production of alpha-hemolysin and proteases and decreased production of coagulase, extracellular protein A, DNase, lipase and delta-hemolysin. No difference was found in the production of beta-hemolysin. Both, Southern blot analysis and transfer of the pleiotropic mutant phenotype by transduction, indicated that the mutation was originated from a single insertion of transposon Tn925. The LD50 determined by intraperitoneal administration in mice showed that mutant RC128 was slightly less virulent than its parental strain.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - DNA cleavage, antiviral and cytotoxic reactions photosensitized by simple enediyne compounds.
AB  - Very potent antibiotic antitumor natural products contain a enediyne moiety which, upon thermal activation, is capable of abstracting hydrogens from DNA. 1,6-Diphenyl-3-hexene-1,5-diyne was selected as a candidate for inducing DNA strand breaks photochemically. Easily interconverted with light, both geometric isomers 1 and 2 were expected to be phototoxic. As anticipated, they photosensitized the production of strand breaks in double-stranded supercoiled pBR322, and in single-stranded M13 DNA. The DNA cleavage reactions were favored by the presence of oxygen and were inhibited by ethanol. Preliminary experiments with the (Z)-isomer indicated moderate light-dependent antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Sindbis virus, and mouse cytomegalovirus. The enediynes were cytotoxic to Escherichia coli, a gram-negative organism, to Streptococcus faecalis, a gram-positive organism, to Daphnia magna and to fish (Pimephales promelas), but only in the presence of light. The production of o-terphenyl, the expected product of Bergman cyclization of 1, could not be confirmed. However, both 1 and 2 photosensitized the formation of singlet oxygen and of superoxide anion radical, and photodynamic reactions could have been responsible for some of the phototoxic reactions observed.
TI  - Serological investigation into the association between Streptococcus bovis and colonic cancer.
AB  - AIMS: To determine if there was an increase in antibody titre to Streptococcus bovis in patients with colonic cancer, and if this might be a useful marker of the presence for colonic cancer. METHODS: Serum samples from 16 patients and 16 age matched controls were tested by immunoblot and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against antigen preparations from two strains of S bovis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: No distinction between cancer patients and controls could be made using immunoblots. ELISA did show an increase in antibodies to S bovis, but there was a greater increase in antibodies to E faecalis. The increase in antibody titres was greatest with antigens which had been treated with periodate, and was therefore thought not to be caused by antibody to the shared group D carbohydrate antigen. CONCLUSION: It may be possible to construct a test for the detection of colonic cancer based on the detection of antibody to S bovis or E faecalis, though considerable further development of this concept is required.
TI  - Protein-sulfenic acid stabilization and function in enzyme catalysis and gene regulation.
AB  - Sulfenic acids (R-SOH) result from the stoichiometric oxidations of thiols with mild oxidants such as H2O2; in solution, however, these derivatives accumulate only transiently due to rapid self-condensation reactions, further oxidations to the sulfinic and/or sulfonic acids, and reactions with nucleophiles such as R-SH. In contrast, oxidations of cysteinyl side chains in proteins, where disulfide bond formation can be prevented and where the reactivity of the nascent cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) can be controlled, have previously been shown to yield stable active-site Cys-SOH derivatives of papain and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. More recently, however, functional Cys-SOH residues have been identified in the native oxidized forms of the FAD-containing NADH peroxidase and NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis; these two proteins constitute a new class within the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. In addition, Cys-SOH derivatives have been suggested to play important roles in redox regulation of the DNA-binding activities of transcription factors such as Fos and Jun, OxyR, and bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 protein. Structural inferences for the stabilization of protein-sulfenic acids, drawn from the refined 2.16-A structure of the streptococcal NADH peroxidase, provide a molecular basis for understanding the proposed redox functions of these novel cofactors in both enzyme catalysis and transcriptional regulation.
TI  - Chromosomally mediated high-level gentamicin resistance in Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - Four blood culture isolates of Streptococcus mitis were found to be resistant to  penicillin (MIC, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml) and gentamicin (MIC, 128 or 1,000 micrograms/ml), and the two antibiotics demonstrated a lack of in vitro synergy. As shown by polymerase chain reaction assays, the structural gene known to encode high-level gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae was also present in all four S. mitis strains. Attempts to isolate plasmids were unsuccessful, but an oligonucleotide probe derived from the gentamicin resistance gene hybridized to distinct restriction fragments of genomic DNA, suggesting that the resistance genes in these strains are integrated into the bacterial chromosome.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a mobilization gene in the streptococcal plasmid, pVA380-1.
AB  - The 4.2-kb cryptic streptococcal plasmid, pVA380-1, has a broad host range and replicates via a rolling circle mode. The nucleotide base sequence of the 2.5-kb basic replicon of this plasmid, containing a plus origin, a minus origin, and a rep gene, was reported previously. The completed nucleotide base sequence of pVA380-1 revealed the presence of two additional open reading frames, ORF2 and ORF3. The protein predicted by ORF2 shared 74% amino acid identity with the Mob protein of the Group B streptococcal plasmid, pMV158. The 170 bases immediately 5' to ORF2 and to mob of pMV158 shared 87% homology and included a putative -10 region and a RSa site. A derivative of pVA380-1 into which a kanamycin resistance gene was inserted outside of the above 170 base region and ORF2 was mobilized by the conjugative streptococcal plasmid, pAM beta 1, into Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sobrinus. Interruption of ORF2 by the same kanamycin resistance gene abolished the mobilizability of pVA380-1.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Partial characterization of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  - With degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal DNA fragment of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of this PCR product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "RpoD box" of primary sigma factors. This PCR product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - The 2.0-A resolution structure of Escherichia coli histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr. A redetermination.
AB  - The x-ray structure of Escherichia coli HPr has been redetermined at 2.0-A resolution. In contrast to the previous study (El-Kabbani, O. A. L., Waygood, E. B., and Delbaere, L. T. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12926-12929), the overall structure is, in general, similar to other reported NMR and x-ray HPr structures, although there are some important differences in detail. The overall folding topology of HPr is a classical open-faced beta-sandwich, consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices. The least square refinement produced an R index of 0.135 for all measured unique data between 8.0 and 2.0 A resolution. The active center consists of His15 which is hydrogen bonded to a sulfate anion, and Arg17 which has a fully open conformation. This corresponds to the first observed "semi-closed" conformation of the active center of HPr. The Streptococcus faecalis HPr structure (Jia, Z., Vandonselaar, M., Quail, J. W., and Delbaere, L. T. J. (1993) Nature 361, 94-97) has the "open" conformation in which the side chains of His15 and Arg17 are directed as far away from each other as possible. The Bacillus subtilis HPr (Herzberg, O., Reddy, P., Sutrina, S., Saier, M. H., Jr., Reizer, J., and Kapadia, G. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 2499-2503) has the "closed" conformation in which the side chains of His15 and Arg17 are close together with a sulfate anion located in the active center. The open conformation represents the unphosphorylated form of HPr whereas the closed conformation likely resembles the phosphorylated form of HPr. The semi-closed conformation observed in the E. coli HPr structure could represent a structural intermediate on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathway of HPr.
TI  - Streptococcal update. A microbiology perspective.
AB  - The streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. Rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the Aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by Group A Streptococcus. Group B, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. A major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. Australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of S pneumoniae. The oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. Disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, Group A has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.
TI  - Molecular cloning, identification, and sequence of the hyaluronan synthase gene from group A Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The hyaluronan (HA) synthase of Group A Streptococci has been identified by transposon mutagenesis and deletion analysis. The genes for the HA synthase and a recently identified UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (Dougherty, B. A., and van de Rijn, I. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7118-7124) reside on a contiguous stretch of 3.2-kilobase pair DNA that can direct HA biosynthesis in Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli as well as mutant Streptococcus (DeAngelis, P. L., Papaconstantinou, J., and Weigel, P. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14568-14571). The synthase contains 395 residues (calculated Mr = 45,063) and migrates on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 42 kDa. E. coli K5, which synthesizes UDP-glucuronic acid for production of its endogenous capsular polysaccharide, can make HA if it contains a plasmid encoding the intact 42-kDa protein. E. coli SURE or chi 1448 cells containing the same construct, however, cannot produce HA since these strains cannot make both required sugar nucleotide precursors. The HA synthase is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with four membrane-associated helices, which is consistent with the location of the enzyme activity in Streptococci. There is significant homology between the HA synthase and the Rhizobium nodC gene product, an enzyme that synthesizes chitin-like oligomers. This is the first description at the molecular level of an enzyme shown to synthesize a glycosaminoglycan.
TI  - The inhibition by ionophores in vitro of an Enterococcus-like pathogen of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.
AB  - Streptococcosis is a major disease of several fish species in Australia, Japan and South Africa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of some ionophores (lasalocid, monensin, narasin and salinomycin) was determined in vitro for an Enterococcus-like species pathogenic for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Australia. Forty isolates of the fish pathogen were tested, together with control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin, the drug of choice for controlling streptococcosis, ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 microgram/ml whereas the MIC values for the ionophores ranged between 0.2 and 1.5 micrograms/ml. Of the ionophores tested, narasin was the most inhibitory (0.2-0.4 microgram/ml), while monensin was the least inhibitory (0.4-1.5 micrograms/ml). Salinomycin was marginally more inhibitory (0.4-0.8 microgram/ml) than lasalocid (0.8 microgram/ml).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - Female genital tract abscess formation in the rat. Use of pathogens including enterococci.
AB  - Previous animal experiments utilizing bowel flora have demonstrated synergy between various aerobes and anaerobes in the formation of intraabdominal abscesses. In these experiments, human female genital tract isolates were inserted into the abdominal and pelvic cavities of 151 female Sprague-Dawley rats. Inoculation with any single species of organism--Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae or Bacteroides bivius or a combination of two facultative organisms (S faecalis plus E cloacae)--did not result in a significant increase in abscess formation. Combination of a facultative organism or organisms with the anaerobe B bivius or S faecalis plus B bivius plus E cloacae resulted in 55% (P < .01) and 74% (P < .0005) rates of abscess formation, respectively, as compared with controls. Combinations including B fragilis demonstrated similar results. Thus, female genital tract facultative organisms demonstrate synergy in the presence of anaerobic organisms in the development of abscesses.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Development of a DNA probe for Streptococcus bovis by using a cloned amylase gene.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. While rarely isolated from humans, S. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. Recent reports have also suggested a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of S. bovis. Identification of S. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. We have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain S. bovis JB1 as a potential DNA probe for rapid and accurate identification of S. bovis strains from all sources. DNAs from strains identified as S. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. The probe also hybridized with variants of S. bovis that did not grow on starch. The probe did not hybridize with DNA isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Enterococcus faecalis but did demonstrate hybridization with Streptococcus salivarius.
TI  - Deamidation of HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, involves asparagine 38 (HPr-1) and asparagine 12 (HPr-2) in isoaspartyl acid formation.
AB  - Histidine-containing protein, HPr, of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli, when incubated at elevated temperatures forms many species of protein. The two major species are HPr-1 and HPr-2, which have been shown to lack one or two amides, respectively (Anderson, B., Weigel, N., Kundig, W., and Roseman, S. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 7023-7033). The formation of HPr-1 and HPr-2 is shown to be pH-dependent and does not occur readily below pH 6. Investigation of the identities and properties of the two residues that deamidate involved creation of site-directed mutants at the 6 glutamine and 2 asparagine residues of HPr; description of their deamidation species by isoelectric focusing; determination of their relative antibody binding properties; assay of their phosphoacceptor and phosphodonor activities; characterization of tryptic and V8-protease peptides; obtaining two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of HPr, HPr-1, and several mutants. It was determined that the sequential deamidation of Asn-38 and Asn-12 yields HPr-1 and HPr-2. Both residues exist as Asn-Gly pairs, and both deamidations probably form isoaspartyl acid. HPr from Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus carnosus which also have Asn-Gly at residues 38 and 39 form HPr-1 species presumably by deamidation. HPr from Streptococcus faecalis which does not have Asn-38 does not form a HPr-1 species. The E. coli mutant HPrs, N12D and Q51E, residues that may be involved in the active site, had impaired phosphohydrolysis properties and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system activity.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - Isolation of a Streptococcus pyogenes gene locus that directs hyaluronan biosynthesis in acapsular mutants and in heterologous bacteria.
AB  - A contiguous 3-kilobase pair region of DNA was isolated from Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) that can direct hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule biosynthesis in acapsular mutants as well as heterologous bacteria. The DNA was identified by transposon 916 insertional mutagenesis and subcloned into a plasmid shuttle vector. Mutant acapsular GAS or Enterococcus faecalis containing this plasmid, but not vector alone, displayed a mucoid phenotype on agar plates, possessed a capsule as seen by light microscopy, and produced HA in quantities comparable with wild-type GAS. The polysaccharide was shown to be authentic HA based on its recognition by a specific proteoglycan and its degradation by Streptomyces hyaluronate lyase. Escherichia coli with the complementing plasmid also produced HA but at only 10% of the level made by the above cells. E. coli minicell analysis showed that two proteins, 42 and 45 kDa, are expressed by the functional DNA insert. Deletion analysis of the insert in the minicells revealed that the 42-kDa protein is essential for HA production. This is the first demonstration of reconstitution of HA capsule biosynthesis in vivo.
TI  - Complementation of an Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) mutant in the alpha subunit of the H(+)-ATPase by cloned genes from the same and different species.
AB  - We isolated an Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis) mutant, designated MS117, in which 'G' at position 301 of the alpha-subunit gene of the F1F0 type of H(+)-ATPase was deleted. MS117 had low H(+)-ATPase activity, was deficient in the regulatory system of cytoplasmic pH, and was unable to grow at pH 6.0. When the alpha-subunit gene of E. hirae H(+)-ATPase was ligated with the shuttle vector pHY300PLK at the downstream region of the tet gene of the vector, it was expressed without its own promoter in MS117, and the mutation of MS117 was complemented; the mutant harbouring the plasmid had the ability to maintain a neutral cytoplasm and grew at pH 6.0. We next transformed MS117 with pHY300PLK containing the alpha-subunit gene of Bacillus megaterium F1F0-ATPase constructed in the same way. The transformant grew at pH 6.0, and the ATP hydrolysis activity was recovered. These results suggested that an active hybrid H(+)-ATPase containing the B. megaterium alpha subunit was produced, and that the hybrid enzyme regulated the enterococcal cytoplasmic pH, although the function of the B. megaterium enzyme did not include pH regulation. Thus, our present results support the previous proposal that the enterococcal cytoplasmic pH is regulated by the F1F0 type of H(+)-ATPase.
TI  - Presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. We isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. Samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. Enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, and Enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other. These bacteria were found in a variety of samples. Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. On the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as E. casseliflavus. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. Nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile groups which could not be identified with the aid of known Aerococcus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, or Streptococcus strains. The maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.
TI  - The cell-bound fructosyltransferase of Streptococcus salivarius: the carboxyl terminus specifies attachment in a Streptococcus gordonii model system.
AB  - The ftf gene, coding for the cell-bound beta-D-fructosyltransferase (FTF) of Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975, has been analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence has been compared with that of the secreted FTF of Streptococcus mutans and the levansucrases (SacBs) of Bacillus species. A unique proline-rich region detected at the C terminus of the FTF of S. salivarius preceded a hydrophobic terminal domain. This proline-rich region was shown to possess strong homology to the product of the prgC gene from pCF10 in Enterococcus faecalis, which encodes a pheromone-responsive protein of unknown function, as well as homology to the human proline-rich salivary protein PRP-4. A series of 3'-OH deletions of the S. salivarius ftf gene expressed in Streptococcus gordonii Challis LGR2 showed that the C terminus was required for cell surface attachment in this heterologous organism, as only the complete gene product was cell bound. This cell-bound activity was released in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that the mode of attachment and release of the S. salivarius FTF in S. gordonii was similar to that in its native host.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the urinary tract of pigs associated with cystitis and pyelonephritis.
AB  - Twenty-three cases of porcine cystitis and pyelonephritis were examined bacteriologically. Eubacterium suis was found in 21 cases. The isolation of large numbers of Escherichia coli in the upper urinary tract was associated with linear renal scarring. An unidentifiable streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from a case of purulent ureteritis, pyelitis and pyelonephritis. The bacterial flora from cases of cystitis and pyelonephritis was different from that isolated from sows with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
TI  - Characterization of the sporulation-related gamma-D-glutamyl-(L)meso-diaminopimelic-acid-hydrolysing peptidase I of Bacillus sphaericus NCTC 9602 as a member of the metallo(zinc) carboxypeptidase A family. Modular design of the protein.
AB  - The sporulation-related gamma-D-glutamyl-(L)meso-diaminopimelic-acid-hydrolysing  peptidase I of Bacillus sphaericus NCTC 9602 has been analysed by proton-induced X-ray emission. It contains 1 equivalent Zn2+ per mol of protein. As derived from gene cloning and sequencing, the B. sphaericus Zn peptidase I is a two-module protein. A 100-amino-acid-residue N-terminal domain consisting of two tandem segments of similar sequences, is fused to a 296-amino-acid-residue C-terminal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain belongs to the Zn carboxypeptidase A family, the closest match being observed with the Streptomyces griseus carboxypeptidase [Narahashi (1990) J. Biochem. 107, 879-886] and with the family prototype, bovine carboxypeptidase A. The catalytic domain of the B. sphaericus peptidase I possesses, distributed along the amino-acid sequence, peptide segments, a triad His162-Glu165-His307 and a dyad Tyr347-Glu366 that are equivalent to secondary structures, the zinc-binding triad His69-Glu72-His196 and the catalytic dyad Tyr248-Glu270 of bovine carboxypeptidase A respectively. The N-terminal repeats of the B. sphaericus peptidase I have similarity with the C-terminal repeats of the Enterococcus hirae muramidase 2, the Streptococcus (now Enterococcus) faecalis autolysin and the Bacillus phi PZA and phi 29 lysozymes, to which a role in the recognition of a particular moiety of the bacterial cell envelope has been tentatively assigned. Detergents enhance considerably the specific activity of the B. sphaericus peptidase I.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - The microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  - Basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of Streptococcaceae are given. Identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, Lancefield group C and G streptococci, S. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (Lancefield grouping). Rapid antigen tests for the detection of group A and B streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. The reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. The elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group A and B streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. Recently employed examples include the M protein gene typing of group A streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of PCR assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. Restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial DNA in association with DNA fragment separation by conventional or PFGE have been applied successfully to several species of Streptococcaceae (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae). Enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe underlying disease. Molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. E. faecalis and E. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. The definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. All enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in E. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Intravenous streptomycin use in a patient infected with high-level, gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of intravenous streptomycin sulfate use in a patient  infected with high-level, gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus faecalis. CASE SUMMARY: A 37-year-old woman with a history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes insipidus possibly induced by lithium, chronic renal insufficiency, and anemia presented with a two-day history of decreased responsiveness, decreased verbalization, and tremulousness. Her hospital course was complicated by polymicrobial sepsis (S. faecalis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and unidentified gram-negative bacilli #2) requiring vancomycin and gentamicin therapy. Gentamicin was discontinued after two doses because she developed acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. Subsequent susceptibility data showed the enterococcus to be highly resistant to gentamicin. The patient deteriorated clinically when treated only with vancomycin. She remained septic with a blood pressure of 80/40 mm Hg; streptomycin was added to her regimen. We were concerned that streptomycin concentrations obtained following intramuscular administration would not be adequate because of possible hypoperfusion. Based on limited published literature, streptomycin was administered intravenously via a central intravenous catheter. DISCUSSION: A review of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant S. faecalis and treatment with intravenous streptomycin therapy are discussed. The availability and monitoring of streptomycin therapy are also described. CONCLUSIONS: Streptomycin is an antimicrobial agent that must be used with vancomycin in serious infections to eradicate high-level, gentamicin-resistant S. faecalis. Its unique administration and monitoring concerns require individual patient assessment.
TI  - Use of modified Rambach agar to differentiate Streptococcus uberis from other mastitis streptococci.
AB  - The medium of Rambach was modified to permit differentiation of mastitis streptococci. A total of 377 streptococci isolated from bovine IMI was used in the study. Of the 159 strains identified as Streptococcus uberis, 151 strains (94.9%) were beta-galactosidase-positive and yielded blue colonies on modified Rambach agar. In comparison, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, or Enterococcus faecalis strains were negative for propylene glycol utilization (red colonies) or beta-galactosidase production; all strains yielded colorless colonies on modified Rambach agar. However, 5 of 35 (14.3%) Streptococcus equinus strains were also positive for beta-galactosidase. Results indicate that modified Rambach agar is a convenient medium for the differentiation of the Strep. uberis from the other mastitis streptococci. Furthermore, modified Rambach agar could be easily incorporated as a screening medium for Strep. uberis in mastitis bacteriology laboratories.
TI  - The efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  Enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), Streptococcus bovis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 mL/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 mL/min). In nine patients valve replacements were performed. Twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. Overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. Out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. In one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. One patient had a clinical relapse. All cultures taken from blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of seven days therapy. Side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. No renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. Our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Prevention of radiation-induced bacteraemia by post-treatment with OK-432 and aztreonam.
AB  - The effects of combined treatment with OK-432, an immunomodulator prepared from Streptococcus haemolyticus, and aztreonam, a monobactum antibiotic, in the prevention of radiation-induced bacteraemia and mortality were examined in ICR-MCH mice irradiated with 9.5 Gy. The organisms recovered from the irradiated mice were Streptococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Treatment with aztreonam reduced the incidence of mice infected with Proteus mirabilis (p < 0.01), but it showed no efficacy on Streptococcus faecalis. OK-432 could reduce the frequency of bacteraemia attributed to both organisms (p < 0.05). Combined treatment with OK-432 and aztreonam further decreased the incidence of bacteraemia by both organisms; no organisms were recovered at 14 days following irradiation. The survival rate at 30 days following irradiation was 80% in mice treated with OK-432 plus aztreonam and 55% with OK-432 alone, while it was 0% in the groups treated with aztreonam or saline alone. These results indicated that combined treatment with OK-432 and a suitable antibiotic such as aztreonam is more effective than OK-432 or aztreonam alone.
TI  - Purification and analysis of streptococcal NADH peroxidase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system, a modified plasmid vector has been developed which gives reliable, high level expression in Escherichia coli of the gene encoding streptococcal NADH peroxidase. The recombinant enzyme has been purified to homogeneity using a revised protocol which yields over 35 mg of pure protein per liter of culture. Recombinant NADH peroxidase is fully active and exhibits spectroscopic and redox properties identical to those for the enzyme purified from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Reductive titrations and thiol analyses confirm the presence of the unusual cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) redox center identified previously. N-terminal sequence analysis, analytical gel filtration, and preliminary x-ray diffraction data all confirm the structural identity of the recombinant and S. faecalis enzymes. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the peroxidase, coupled with results from static titration experiments is consistent with a limiting type of ternary complex mechanism and allows the determination of many of the corresponding kinetic constants. In addition, preliminary 1H NMR spectra of the enzyme at millimolar concentrations show good dispersion in the amide region and indicate that the recombinant peroxidase is suitable for one-dimensional NMR work with labeled amino acids.
TI  - Acute valvular obstruction from streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  
TI  - A patch-clamp investigation of the Streptococcus faecalis cell membrane.
AB  - The patch-clamp technique was used to study the membrane of giant protoplasts from the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus faecalis, demonstrating the presence of ion-conducting pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of procaryotes. The single channel recordings were characterized by a variety of conductances, ranging up to a few nanoSiemens, arising from stretch-activated, voltage-modulated, cooperative channels. Activation by stretch and voltage took place via both a decrease of the mean closed time and an increase of the mean open time of the channels, which are strictly controlled in intact cells, where they might constitute parts of a membrane apparatus or transport system.
TI  - NADH binding site and catalysis of NADH peroxidase.
AB  - The structure of the complex between cofactor NADH and the enzyme NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 (Enterococcus faecalis) has been determined by crystal soaking, X-ray data collection, model building of NADH and refinement at 0.24-nm resolution based on the known enzyme structure [Stehle, T., Ahmed, S. A., Claiborne, A. & Schulz, G. E. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 221, 1325-1344]. Apart from NADH, the catalytic center of the enzyme contains FAD and a cysteine that shuttles between thiolate and sulfenic acid states. Unfortunately, this cysteine was irreversibly oxidized to a cysteine sulfonic acid in the established enzyme structure. Based on the geometry of the catalytic center, we discuss the stabilization of the oxidation-sensitive sulfenic acid and propose a reaction mechanism.
TI  - Active-centre torsion-angle strain revealed in 1.6 A-resolution structure of histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein.
AB  - The histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) is a central component of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system that transports carbohydrates across the cell membrane of bacteria. A typical phosphotransfer sequence is phosphoenolpyruvate-->enzyme I-->HPr-->enzyme II/IIIsugar-->sugar. This is thermodynamically favourable owing to the participation of the high-energy phosphoenolpyruvate. We report here the structure of HPr from Streptococcus faecalis determined at 1.6 A resolution. Remarkable disallowed Ramachandran torsion angles at the active centre, revealed by the X-ray structure, demonstrate a unique example of torsion-angle strain that is probably directly involved in protein function. During phosphorylation, the active-centre torsion-angle strain should facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction by lowering the activation-energy barrier. A recently reported Bacillus subtilis HPr structure, which represents the phosphorylated state of HPr with no torsion-angle strain, provides direct evidence supporting our hypothesis that torsion-angle strain plays a direct part in the function of HPr. An HPr phosphotransfer cycling mechanism is proposed, based primarily on the structures of HPr and other phosphotransferase system proteins.
TI  - [Stimulatory effect of serotonin on the growth of the yeast Candida guilliermondii and the bacterium Streptococcus faecalis].
AB  - Periodic addition of serotonin into a cultivation medium during growing of the yeast Candida guilliermondii and the bacterium Streptococcus faecalis exerts stimulatory influence on the growth of the cultures. The effect manifests itself in activating cell reproduction in the lag-phase, accelerating exponential growth of the cultures and their quicker reaching the stationary phase. The stimulatory effect of serotonin is optimal if serotonin is added to the growth medium at concentrations up to 10(-7) M with a periodicity of 2 hours.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic analysis of the unidirectional theta replication of the S. agalactiae plasmid pIP501.
AB  - pIP501 is a broad-host-range plasmid originating from Streptococcus agalactiae. In this report we show that (i) it replicates by a theta mechanism initiating at the 3' end of the gene encoding the replication protein RepR and progressing in the direction of transcription of this gene; (ii) its replication origin lies within or a few nucleotides downstream from ORF R and not upstream from it as suggested in the literature (Brantl et al. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 4783-4789); (iii) the RepR protein positively regulates pIP501 copy number; and (vi) the main function ensured by the sequences located upstream from ORF R is to express this ORF. Since the replication properties of pIP501 are indistinguishable from those of the highly related Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1, we conclude that these elements form the first family of theta replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. Based on sequence similarities, we extend this family to the S. pyogenes plasmid pSM19035 and to 12 other plasmids isolated from streptococci or enterococci.
TI  - Development and use of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for differentiation of Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus parauberis.
AB  - Oligonucleotide probes specific for 16S rRNA and capable of differentiating Streptococcus uberis and S. parauberis from each other and other esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci were developed. Use of a mini-RNA extraction technique for gram-positive cocci associated with bovine mastitis has allowed the probes to be used for identification of esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci from two dairy herds at the Institute for Animal Health, Compton, United Kingdom. One hundred seventy-nine of 206 isolates were identified as S. uberis, 3 were identified as S. parauberis, and 24 were not identified. Isolates not identified by the probes were tested biochemically and found to be mainly Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, or S. bovis.
TI  - Effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  - An experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). The infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. The mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (NS). In the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001). In experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of HBO to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  - The study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. Most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were Gram-negative--27%, mainly E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and Lactobacillus in 53% of cases. Other anaerobic bacteria were: Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), Streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14.1%). Gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). All strains of G. vaginalis were susceptible to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.
TI  - Cytokine production by the human bladder carcinoma cell line T24 in the presence  of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).
AB  - The study was initiated as an in vitro approach to the situation existing during  intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation in patients with superficial bladder cancer. Cytokine secretion of a human bladder carcinoma cell line T24 treated with BCG was investigated. A 24-h treatment of T24 cells with BCG resulted in a tenfold higher secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) when compared with T24 cells treated with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis or a cell wall preparation of Nocardia rubra (N-CWS). No secretion of IL-1 beta and IL-2 was detected. Pre-exposing T24 cells to BCG for various periods of time indicated that a minimum exposure time of 0.5-1 h was required to upregulate IL-6 and TNF alpha production. Extending the BCG pre-exposure time to 2 and 3 h further increased the rate of cytokine production. No significant difference was found, however, between the rate of secretion initiated after a 2-h or 3-h pre-exposure period. The amounts of these cytokines secreted in the presence of BCG-conditioned medium did not differ significantly from the constitutively secreted amounts, excluding an effect of products possibly secreted by BCG on the upregulation of IL-6 and TNF alpha. In addition, upregulation of cytokine production appeared to be dependent on the concentration of BCG. The results suggest that cytokines may be produced by urothelial tumor cells after intravesical instillation in patients with superficial bladder cancer, which may play a role in the mode of action of BCG.
TI  - Catalytic properties of streptococcal NADH oxidase containing artificial flavins.
AB  - The flavoprotein NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, which catalyzes the tetravalent reduction of O2-->2H2O, has been purified as the apoenzyme to allow reconstitution studies with both native and artificial flavins. Turnover numbers for the enzyme containing 1-deaza-, 2-thio-, and 4-thio-FAD range from 51 to 4% of that of the native FAD enzyme; these reconstituted oxidases also catalyze the four-electron reduction of oxygen. Dithionite and NADH titrations of the native FAD oxidase require 1.7 eq of reductant/FAD and follow spectral courses very similar to those previously reported for the purified holoenzyme. Azide is a linear mixed-type inhibitor with respect to NADH, and dithionite titrations in the presence of azide yield significant stabilization of the neutral blue semiquinone. Redox stoichiometries for the oxidase containing modified flavins range from 1.1 to 1.4 eq of reductant/FAD. Spectrally distinct reduced enzyme.NAD+ complexes result with all but the 2-thio-FAD enzyme on titration with NADH. The reduced 4-thio-FAD oxidase shows little or no evidence of desulfurization to native FAD on reduction and reoxidation. Both the 8-mercapto- (E'o = -290 mV) and 8-hydroxy-FAD (E'o = -335 mV) oxidase are readily reduced by excess NADH. These results offer a further basis for analysis of the active-site structure and oxygen reactivity of this unique flavoprotein oxidase.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Expression of protein F, the fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes JRS4, in heterologous streptococcal and enterococcal strains promotes their adherence to respiratory epithelial cells.
AB  - In a previous study we reported the identification of protein F, a fibronectin-binding protein that was essential to the ability of Streptococcus pyogenes JRS4 to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells (E. Hanski and M. Caparon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:6172-6176, 1992). To further evaluate the role of protein F in the adherence of the group A streptococci, we screened other group A streptococcal strains, including six recent clinical isolates, and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis for their capacity to bind fibronectin and for the presence of the gene encoding protein F (prtF). Seven of eight group A streptococcal strains analyzed, including all recent clinical isolates, both bound fibronectin at high affinity and contained DNA sequences that hybridized with a prtF-specific probe. One group A streptococcal isolate and the strain of E. faecalis examined neither contained a prtF-related gene nor bound fibronectin. These two strains also could not efficiently adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. However, upon the introduction of the cloned prtF gene, both of these strains gained the capacity to bind fibronectin and to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. These results suggest that protein F is an important adhesin, which may have a general role in the virulence of the group A streptococci.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - High-level aminoglycoside resistance among enterococci and group A streptococci.
AB  - The occurrence of high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAmR) was determined for 73 enterococci and 54 group A streptococci by the high-load disc method, tube macrodilution and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR method revealed the presence of genes coding for aminoglycoside-3'-O-phosphoryltransferase-III (APH(3')-III), aminoglycoside-6'-N-acetyltransferase/2''-O-phosphoryltransferase (AAC(6')/APH(2'')), or both, in 20.6%, 9.6% and 4.1% of the enterococci, respectively. The prevalence of HLAmR to at least one aminoglycoside among local enterococci was 37% (27/73). Only one of 54 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates produced APH(3')-III and exhibited high-level resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin. In general, the three methods yielded comparable results, with only three discrepancies among the 127 isolates examined. High-load disc screening and tube macrodilution proved to be practical, reliable and reproducible, and thus suitable for routine screening. Of 20 Enterococcus faecalis strains tested, all were penicillin-tolerant. Only one of seven penicillin-tolerant S. pyogenes strains was HLAmR. No association between the two forms of resistance was found.
TI  - Identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs Ent. hirae was found almost as often as Ent. faecalis. Most Ent. faecium strains from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in that they fermented sorbitol. Typical Ent. avium as well as atypical Ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species Ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. Enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. Certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as Ent. cecorum, shared characteristics with Ent. columbae. The most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were Streptococcus suis and Strep. canis. Streptococcus canis and Strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. The canine Strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. Forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. The characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'Ton 31 group' and 'O7 group' are described.
TI  - Molecular cloning and analysis of the gene encoding the NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Comparison with NADH peroxidase and the flavoprotein disulfide reductases.
AB  - The gene encoding the streptococcal flavoprotein NADH oxidase (NOXase), which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of O2-->2H2O, has been cloned and sequenced from the genome of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis 10C1 (ATCC 11700). The deduced NOXase protein sequence corresponds to a molecular mass of 48.9 kDa and contains three previously sequenced cysteinyl peptides obtained with the purified enzyme. In Escherichia coli, the expressed nox gene produced a catalytically active product, which retained its immunoreactivity to affinity-purified NOXase antisera. Alignment of the NOXase protein sequence with that of streptococcal NADH peroxidase (NPXase) revealed that the proteins are 44% identical. Among the most highly conserved segments is a sequence containing Cys42; this residue is known to exist as a stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) in NPXase and serves as the non-flavin redox center. In addition, three previously identified NPXase segments, known to be involved in FAD and NAD(P)-binding in other pyridine nucleotide-linked flavoprotein oxidoreductases, are strongly conserved in NOXase. Overall, the extensive homology observed between NOXase and NPXase suggests that the monomer chain fold of the oxidase closely resembles that of the peroxidase. Both sequences share limited but significant homology to those of glutathione reductase and other members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. These and other considerations suggest that these two unusual streptococcal flavoproteins constitute a distinct class of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, the flavoprotein peroxide reductases, easily contrasted with enzymes such as glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.
TI  - Culture media for enterococci and group D-streptococci.
AB  - Lancefield group D-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. They encompass the new genus Enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. Streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus. The serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. Food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. Up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. The selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. It depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. The choice of media is made more difficult as commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. Therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. The selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (CATC), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (KAA) and M-enterococcus agar (ME) including earlier results with aesculin bile azide agar (ABA), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (TITG). No medium was completely selective for all group D-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single Enterococcus species, e.g., for E. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. Confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. Selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.
TI  - [A comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  - Vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. They have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. In vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. The activity of the two antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus is similar. The serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). We compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the MIC90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. The inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin MIC was lower.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Gene structure of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) F1F0-ATPase, which  functions as a regulator of cytoplasmic pH.
AB  - Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis) ATCC 9790 has an F1F0-ATPase which functions as a regulator of the cytoplasmic pH but does not synthesize ATP. We isolated four clones which contained genes for c, b, delta, and alpha subunits of this enzyme but not for other subunit genes. It was revealed that two specific regions (upstream of the c-subunit gene and downstream of the gamma-subunit gene) were lost at a specific site in the clones we isolated, suggesting that these regions were unstable in Escherichia coli. The deleted regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the nucleotide sequences of these regions were determined. The results showed that eight genes for a, c, b, delta, alpha, gamma, beta, and epsilon subunits were present in this order. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showed that these eight genes were transcribed to one mRNA. The i gene was not found in the upper region of the a-subunit gene. Instead of the i gene, this operon contained a long untranslated region (240 bp) whose G + C content was only 30%. There was no typical promoter sequence such as was proposed for E. coli, suggesting that the promoter structure of this species is different from that of E. coli. Deduced amino acid sequences suggested that E. hirae H(+)-ATPase is a typical F1F0-type ATPase but that its gene structure is not identical to that of other bacterial F1F0-ATPases.
TI  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - Twelve bacterial species including Streptococcus uberis, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. bovis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. saccharolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. avium, and Aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16S ribosomal DNA fingerprint patterns. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16S rRNA genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16S ribosomal gene fragments from genomic DNAs. The molecular sizes of the amplified 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. All 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16S rDNA fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases HhaI, RsaI, and MspI. A scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. Eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16S rDNA fingerprinting. All 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using HhaI, RsaI, and MspI restriction endonucleases. The results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16S rDNA fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.
TI  - Macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. Some of the highly purified LTAs, in particular LTAs from Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. As after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these LTAs reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. Other purified LTAs, i.e., LTAs from Streptococcus sanguis, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from Micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native LTA from S. aureus was inactive. There was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of LTAs. Deacylation of LTAs resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated LTAs did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of LTA to the cell surface. The results demonstrate that some LTA species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. Spanish Collaborative Group.
AB  - The activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. Clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups C, G and F, Brucella melitensis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against Ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against Campylobacter spp. In general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. Cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. Clarithromycin was bactericidal against Streptococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E1077 for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), E1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. The MIC90S of E1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; E1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. E1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa. In general, the antibacterial profile of E1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
TI  - Evaluation of the E test by using selected gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The E test (AB Biodisk NA Inc.) was compared with standard reference methods using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards's recommendations for determining the MICs of four selected antibiotics against 208 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. These bacteria included 32 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 25 strains of Enterococcus faecium, 20 strains of oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (OSSA), 96 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA), and 35 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Evaluation included MIC accuracy within 1 dilution, reproducibility testing, and cost analysis. There was 94% agreement between the E test and the reference method in testing S. pneumoniae and penicillin G. There was 92% agreement with ampicillin and 100% agreement with vancomycin in testing E. faecium isolates. Accuracy of the oxacillin E test with staphylococci was significantly improved by the use of salt-supplemented Mueller-Hinton agar, for an agreement of 100% with coagulase-negative staphylococci and oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus and that of 85% with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, with no major discrepancies. The E test with American Type Culture Collection isolates and clinical strains gave excellent reproducibility and was less costly than microdilution panels when used to test fewer than three antibiotics. The E test is a simple, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective method for MIC determination for gram-positive organisms.

TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - The distribution of homologous enterococcal plasmid DNA sequences in human faecal isolates.
AB  - Hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. isolated from faeces of humans of various ages. As DNA probes for the survey three plasmids, whose DNAs did not hybridize each other and designated as pMS13, pTW34 and pHK30, were selected from plasmids borne in Ent. faecalis. pTW34 DNA hybridized only with DNAs from enterococci, with high frequency in Ent. faecalis and low frequency in Ent. faecium. pMS13 DNA hybridized with DNAs of all Enterococcus spp. tested and with Strep. bovis, Strep. equinus and Strep. salivarius. Eighty-five percent of Ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pMS13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. Some enterococci had DNAs which hybridized with the pHK30 probe. The different distribution of the three DNA sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid DNAs encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.
TI  - Preferential activation of peripheral blood V gamma 9+ gamma/delta T cells by group A, B and C but not group D or F streptococci.
AB  - Previous studies have established that inactivated mycobacteria are potent and selective activators of V gamma 9+/V delta 2+ human gamma/delta T cells. Here we have analysed the proliferative response of human gamma/delta T cells to five serologically distinct groups of streptococci. While heat-inactivated streptococci of all five serogroups tested (A, B, C, D and F) induced a strong proliferative response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), only groups A, B and C elicited a selective activation of V gamma 9+ gamma/delta T cells in 10 (serogroup B) or 11 (serogroups A and C) of 11 tested healthy individuals. In striking contrast, groups D and F streptococci failed to activate gamma/delta T cells in nine of 11 donors and induced only a weak gamma/delta T cell response in two additional individuals. Depletion of V gamma 9+ T cells before culture completely eliminated all gamma/delta T cell responses to streptococci. These data indicate that groups A, B and C (but not D or F) streptococci can be included in the growing list of selective ligands for V gamma 9+/V delta 2+ human gamma/delta T cells.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans  mannitol-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the mannitol-specific factor III gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, utilizes carbohydrates by means of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS facilitates vectorial translocation of metabolizable carbohydrates to form the corresponding sugar-phosphates, which are subsequently converted to glycolytic intermediates. The PTS consists of both sugar-specific and sugar-independent components. Complementation of an Escherichia coli mtlD mutation with a streptococcal recombinant DNA library allowed isolation of the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (mtlD) and the adjacent sugar-specific mannitol factor III gene (mtlF) from S. mutans. Subsequent transposon mutagenesis of the complementing DNA fragment with Tn5seq1 defined the region that encodes the mtlD-complementing activity, the streptococcal mtlD gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed two complete open reading frames (ORFs) from within the streptococcal mannitol PTS operon. One ORF encodes the mtlD gene product, a 43.0-kDa protein which exhibits similarity to the E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases. The second ORF encodes a 15.8-kDa protein which exhibits similarity to mannitol factor III proteins from several bacterial species. In vitro transcription-translation assays were used to produce proteins of the sizes predicted by the streptococcal ORFs. These data indicate that the S. mutans mannitol PTS utilizes an enzyme II-factor III complex similar to the mannitol system found in other gram-positive organisms, as opposed to that of E. coli, which utilizes an independent enzyme II system.
TI  - Conditions modulating the ionic selectivity of transport by monensin examined on  Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) by 23Na-NMR and K+ atomic absorption.
AB  - Factors likely to modulate the ionic selectivity of monensin were examined on Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) in two states previously characterized: the resting (de-energized) cell and the active (energized) cell. Internal and external Na+ were followed by corresponding 23Na-NMR resonances K+ concentrations were measured by atomic absorption. For a given cellular population of de-energized cells, the apparent transport rates and the final cationic concentrations reached at the steady state were decreasing with the ionophore dose. Monensin was selective for sodium only at low concentrations, in the range 1 mM-10(-4) mM the transport was depending on the effective cationic gradients. Comparison of the activity curves for two cell populations (7.10(9) and 7.10(10) cells/ml) showed the importance of the ratios of monensin/mg phospholipid and also of the ratios of external/internal volumes. On energized cells, except for low monensin concentrations, the main effect was a K(+)-induced efflux and not a Na+ influx. Two factors were modulating the resulting selectivity of this ionophore: the response of the intrinsic bacterial carriers and the generation of the gradients (mainly the external pH) which were favourable to a K+/Na+ transport. Once again the results obtained for two cell populations could be compared, the determining factors were the ratio external/internal volume and the generation of the pH gradient.
TI  - Streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in patients with cancer.
AB  - Eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus Enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at Institut Jules Bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. The incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by Streptococcus angionosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (A, B, C, and G). Twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. One-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. Forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microL). Only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. Twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. Five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome. The source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. No unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one S. mitis and one E. faecium. No relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.
TI  - PCR amplification of streptococcal DNA using crude cell lysates.
AB  - Gram-positive organisms such as streptococci and enterococci are often difficult  to lyse. Obtaining DNA for procedures such as PCR amplification usually requires a large scale isolation for each strain under investigation. We describe a simple procedure for small volumes of whole cells, involving pretreatment with detergent and proteinase that allows for efficient release of DNA for PCR amplification. This procedure is fast, reproducible, can be used with a large number of samples, and has been successfully applied to a variety of streptococcal and enterococcal strains.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - Nosocomial bacterial infections in very low birth weight infants.
AB  - The occurrence of congenital and nosocomial bacterial septicaemia has been documented by identifying the number of positive blood cultures by reviewing the laboratory and clinical records of 394 very low birth weight infants who were consecutively admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit over a 40-month period. The incidence of congenital septicaemia was 6% and of nosocomial septicaemia 17%. The commonest causes of congenital infection were Streptococcus agalactiae Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis (each in 18% of cases). The commonest cause of nosocomial infection was S. epidermidis (51% of cases), except in infants of birth weight less than 750 g. Risk factors for nosocomial infection were extremely low birth weight, very preterm birth and prolonged ventilation. Nosocomial infection was associated with significantly lengthened hospital admission.
TI  - Study on the influence of adsorbent substances against the antigen activity of inactivated orovaccines.
AB  - Specific IgAGM, IgA and IgG levels were evaluated in two groups of rabbits orally treated with inactivated vaccine consisting of Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis and with the same vaccine supplemented with charcoal and kaolin, respectively. The determinations demonstrated that charcoal and kaolin do not have a significant, negative effect on immunoresponses at the intestinal and hematic level after both medium (two-week) and prolonged (four-week) treatment.
TI  - Gadolinium ion inhibits loss of metabolites induced by osmotic shock and large stretch-activated channels in bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria subjected to a hypotonic osmotic shock lose internal ions and also metabolites, without lysis of the cells. We show that the presence in the shock medium, at submillimolar concentrations, of the ion gadolinium, recently shown to block stretch-activated channels in Xenopus oocytes [Yang, X.-C. & Sachs, F. (1989) Science 243, 1068-1071], was sufficient to inhibit shock-induced release of metabolites such as lactose and ATP in Escherichia coli and ATP in Streptococcus faecalis. Moreover, gadolinium was observed, in patch-clamp experiments, to inhibit the giant stretch-activated channels of E. coli, S. faecalis. and Bacillus subtilis. Taken together, these data suggest that stretch-activated channels are localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, where they control the efflux of osmotic solutes, thus probably playing a major role in the response to hypotonic osmotic shock.
TI  - Identical genes confer high-level resistance to gentamicin upon Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The structural gene coding for the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying 6'-acetyltransferase-2''-phosphotransferase (6'AAC-2''APH) enzyme was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using template DNA of clinical isolates of enterococci (both Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and the single high-level gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain identified thus far. The results of the present study demonstrated that the genes encoding this antibiotic resistance trait are highly homologous in these species. In dot blot hybridization assays using nonradioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes, strains with and without high-level gentamicin resistance could be discerned unequivocally. The gene segment encoding 6'-acetylating activity and the gene segment encoding 2''-phosphorylating activity were simultaneously present in all isolates exhibiting high-level gentamicin resistance.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Flavin-linked peroxide reductases: protein-sulfenic acids and the oxidative stress response.
AB  - Sequence analyses of the Streptococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase and the flavoprotein component of the Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase indicate clear evolutionary links with members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. However, chemical and spectroscopic evidence demonstrate that the non-flavin redox center in NADH peroxidase is an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) derivative, and not a cystine disulfide as found in the disulfide reductases. This redox-active element, when appropriately stabilized by the respective protein environment, appears to play key roles in both the catalytic and regulatory aspects of the bacterial response to oxidative stress.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  - The activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. Decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. Decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, group C and G streptococci, with an MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. It was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml). The activity of decaplanin against enterococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. Decaplanin was active from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Inoculum size had a minimal effect on MICs, and increased concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter MICs or MBCs.
TI  - Microflora of the pouch of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  - Microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. No microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of 17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). Growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. Seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. Based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.
TI  - Aminoglycoside-resistant Streptococcus and Enterococcus species isolated from bovine mammary secretions.
AB  - A total of 117 isolates representing four Streptococcus species and 20 isolates representing two Enterococcus species from bovine mammary secretions were examined for resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin. Resistance to streptomycin (85.4%) was most prevalent, followed by kanamycin (19%) and gentamicin (2.2%). Minimum inhibitory concentration of streptomycin for most organisms examined ranged from 16 to 250 micrograms/ml. For kanamycin, the minimum inhibitory concentration for most organisms was .5 to 62.5 micrograms/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin was lower than for kanamycin. Two strains each of Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis had minimum inhibitory concentration for streptomycin of greater than 2000 micrograms/ml, and two strains of E. faecalis had similar minimum inhibitory concentration for kanamycin. The minimum bactericidal concentration for all organisms was one to four times higher than minimum inhibitory concentration. None of the organisms evaluated was found to carry plasmids. Transfer of antibiotic resistance in plasmid-free strains was not achieved by mobilization with the aid of plasmid pAD1, indicating the absence of conjugative transposons. These data suggest that expression of aminoglycoside resistance of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species of bovine origin is likely due to factors other than plasmids or conjugative transposons.
TI  - A hemolysin-encoding plasmid contributes to bacterial virulence in experimental Enterococcus faecalis endophthalmitis.
AB  - Beta-hemolysin production is a variable trait of the Lancefield group D streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis. The E. faecalis hemolysin is encoded by large transmissible plasmids. The variable nature of this putative virulence factor provided an ideal system for testing its contribution in experimental endophthalmitis. In this study, isogenic E. faecalis strains were compared to determine whether the presence of the hemolysin-encoding plasmid affected the severity of disease in a rabbit endophthalmitis model. Experimental infections (n = 6) with 10(1)-10(4) E. faecalis organisms harboring the hemolysin-encoding plasmid resulted in a 98% loss of retinal function (by electroretinography [ERG]) and white reflex by postoperative day 3. By contrast, infections of similar numbers of plasmid-free E. faecalis organisms (n = 5) resulted in retention of some retinal function (23% per ERG) with a red reflex demonstrated on postoperative day 3. Results of light microscopy, slit-lamp examination, ERG, and indirect ophthalmoscopy indicated that infections with hemolysin-encoding plasmid-containing E. faecalis resulted in a more aggressive endophthalmitis compared with the endophthalmitis caused by plasmid-free E. faecalis. This is the first endophthalmitis model to the authors' knowledge that specifically evaluates bacterial virulence using isogenic strains.
TI  - Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for enzymatic amplification of recA sequences  from gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas.
AB  - RecA protein in gram-negative bacteria, especially in Escherichia coli, has been  extensively studied, but little is known about this key enzyme in other procaryotes. Described here are degenerate oligonucleotide primers that have been used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) recA sequences from several gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas. The DNA sequences of recA PCR products from Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Mycoplasma pulmonis were determined and compared. These data indicate that the M. pulmonis recA gene has diverged significantly from recA genes of other eubacteria. It should be possible to use cloned recA PCR products to construct recA mutants, thereby providing the means of elucidating homologous genetic recombination and DNA repair activities in these organisms.
TI  - Modular design of the Enterococcus hirae muramidase-2 and Streptococcus faecalis  autolysin.
AB  - The mature forms of the extracellular muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae and Streptococcus faecalis autolysin have very similar primary structures. Each consists of an active-site-containing N-terminal domain fused to a multiple-repeat C-terminal domain. Polypeptide segments occurring at equivalent places in these two bacterial wall lytic enzymes have homologues in two phage lysozymes and in three functionally unrelated proteins, illustrating the principle that protein molecules frequently are constructed from modules that are linked in a single polypeptide chain.
TI  - [Affinities of PBPs of enterococci to cefepime and ampicillin].
AB  - The beta-lactam resistance of genus Streptococcus has been explained by the low binding affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to the drug. This study was carried out to resolve the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the species of genus Enterococcus by means of binding affinities of PBPs. Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium were employed as assay microbes. Cefepime (CFPM) and ampicillin (ABPC) were used as representatives of cephems and penicillins, respectively. All the PBP fractions of S. pyogenes manifested high binding affinities to CFPM and ABPC, whereas PBPs 1 and 4 of E. faecalis showed high binding affinities to ABPC but not to CFPM. In E. faecium, PBPs of an exceptionally penicillin-susceptible strain manifested a high binding affinity to ABPC, but PBPs 5 and 6 showed low affinities to CFPM. beta-lactam resistant strains of E. faecium possessed PBPs 5 and 6 with low binding affinities to CFPM and ABPC. All the fractions of PBPs but PBP 1 in E. avium showed low binding affinities to CFPM. Although all the PBP fractions but PBPs 3 and 6 manifested high binding affinities to ABPC, PBPs 3 and 6 showed low binding affinities to ABPC. A strain of E. avium, which is susceptible to ABPC but moderately resistant to CFPM, lacked PBP 6. In conclusion, the resistance of E. avium to CFPM is based upon low binding affinities of the many fractions to this drug, and ABPC resistance is based upon PBPs 3 and 6 with low binding affinities to ABPC.
TI  - Clarithromycin in vitro activity enhanced by its major metabolite, 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.
AB  - 14-Hydroxyclarithromycin, an active metabolite of clarithromycin, was compared for antimicrobial activity alone and in combination with the parent compound. The 14-hydroxyclarithromycin potency was comparable to that of clarithromycin, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 1 microgram/ml). Combination MICs at pharmacokinetic ratios produced end points equal to the most active component of the combination. However, checkerboard MICs and kill-curve studies suggested enhanced interactive effects. Partial synergy and additive interactions were demonstrated in 96% of strains tested with synergy (partial) most often observed among the Enterococcus faecalis, H. influenzae, and staphylococci. To determine the best in vitro test methods for predicting the value of 14-hydroxyclarithromycin, combination disks or ratio MIC tests may not be practical. A modification of the proposed clarithromycin-susceptible breakpoint (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) upward to less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml (greater than or equal to 14 mm) was suggested to recognize the additional activity contributed by the 14-hydroxy metabolite. This modification should be applied, limited to susceptibility tests of H. influenzae and possibly the enterococci.
TI  - [Antimicrobial and membranolytic activities of anti-burn drug fenozan].
AB  - Fenozan, an anti-burn preparation, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against freshly isolated clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, as well as against collection strains of the other gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial action of the preparation was possibly due to impairment of permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes in the sensitive bacterial cells and their liberation of intracellular low molecular weight compounds to the environment. The membranolytic and minimum inhibitory concentrations of fenozan with respect to the sensitive bacterial cells were one order of magnitude lower than the concentration stabilizing the membranes of animal cells in the treatment of burns. Combination of the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in fenozan was likely to provide its satisfactory therapeutic effect in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the muramidase-2 gene from Enterococcus hirae.
AB  - Extracellular muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 was purified to homogeneity by substrate binding, guanidine-HCl extraction, and reversed-phase chromatography. A monoclonal antibody, 2F8, which specifically recognizes muramidase-2, was used to screen a genomic library of E. hirae ATCC 9790 DNA in bacteriophage lambda gt11. A positive phage clone containing a 4.5-kb DNA insert was isolated and analyzed. The EcoRI-digested 4.5-kb fragment was cut into 2.3-, 1.0-, and 1.5-kb pieces by using restriction enzymes KpnI, Sau3AI, and PstI, and each fragment was subcloned into plasmid pJDC9 or pUC19. The nucleotide sequence of each subclone was determined. The sequence data indicated an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 666 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 70,678 Da. The first 24 N-terminal amino acids of purified extracellular muramidase-2 were in very good agreement with the deduced amino acid sequence after a 49-amino-acid putative signal sequence. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed the presence at the C-terminal region of the protein of six highly homologous repeat units separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences that are highly enriched in serine and threonine. The overall sequence showed a high degree of homology with a recently cloned Streptococcus faecalis autolysin.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared with those of five other quinolones.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. The MIC of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera Serratia, Citrobacter, and Providencia were MICs above 1 microgram/ml. Some 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. All (100%) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. The inoculum size had little effect on either the MIC or the MBC of sparfloxacin. An increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mM increased the MIC between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. Sparfloxacin was less active at pH 5. The antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones with which it was compared; against Streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable to that of ciprofloxacin except against Enterobacter and Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas cepacia, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes and Flavobacterium spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.
TI  - The effect of isolated high-energy shock wave treatments on subsequent bacterial  growth.
AB  - To determine whether high-energy shock waves possess bactericidal potential, ATCC strains of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were suspended in solution at concentrations approximating 10(6) bacteria per milliliter, placed in polypropylene cryovials, and immersed in the water bath of a Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. Each cryovial was then fluoroscopically guided to the epicenter of the f2 focal point and 2000 shocks at 20 kV applied. Suspensions were then serially diluted and colony counts obtained. The procedure was then repeated with 4000 shocks at 20 kV from the Dornier HM3 and 4000 shocks at intensity level 4 from a Wolff Piezolith 2200 shock wave lithotriptor. Comparison of shock-wave-treated and sham-treated bacterial suspensions revealed no significant difference in bacterial growth according to the colony count technique. We conclude that high-energy shock waves, whether generated by spark gap or piezoelectric array, do not possess significant bactericidal activity.
TI  - Enterococcal and streptococcal species isolated from faeces of calves, young cattle and dairy cows.
AB  - Faeces from non-ruminating calves were found to contain several species of enterococci: Enterococcus avium, Ent. cecorum, Ent. durans, Ent. faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. hirae. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequent. Few of these animals carried streptococci. Streptococcus bovis largely predominated in ruminating calves, young cattle and dairy cows. Other streptococci as well as enterococci were infrequent in dairy cows, but a variety of other streptococci and enterococci were found in the faeces of young ruminating animals.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - The endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  - The microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. A total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe Streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, Peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by Eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'Streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella oralis (formerly Bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. Highly significant associations were discovered between four pairs of species, viz P. melaninogenica with P. micros, P. melaninogenica with P. oralis, Prevotella corporis with Streptococcus morbillorum and Actinomyces odontolyticus with E. faecalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mutagenicity studies of water-soluble phosphazene high polymers.
AB  - Eight water-soluble phosphazene high polymers, [NPR2]n (R, organic, water-solubilizing side-group; n, approx: 15,000) and the small-molecule counterparts of the polymers were examined for antibacterial activity against six different strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100), Salmonella pullorum, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Antibacterial testing was carried out by measuring zones of inhibition and changes in solution turbidity over time. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the surfaces of cross-linked poly[di(methoxyethoxyethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) hydrogels were investigated. A number of the high polymers, as well as the MEEP hydrogels, impeded bacterial growth. Only E. coli was unaffected by the phosphazenes. A possible explanation for the antibacterial character of the polymers is presented. The same compounds were monitored for potential mutagenic activity using the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA 100 and TA 98. None of the high polymers or their small-molecule analogues showed mutagenic activity in either strain of Salmonella at the concentrations tested. The use of these materials as coatings for artificial implants is discussed.
TI  - Proposal of a new scheme for the serological typing of Enterococcus faecalis strains.
AB  - No systematic study on serotyping of Enterococcus faecalis has been reported since 1964 when M.E. Sharpe conducted serotyping of group D streptococcus in U.K. So, we attempted to re-evaluate serotyping of E. faecalis. For this purpose, we received 42 Sharpe's strains and first examined for their biochemical characteristics as E. faecalis. Only 9 of the 42 strains were identified as E. faecalis. We raised rabbit antisera against a large number of E. faecalis strains, including the 9 Sharpe's strains, 2 strains obtained from CDC in U.S.A. and 36 strains isolated from patients hospitalized in different cities of Japan. From the results of cross-agglutination tests and absorption tests performed on these antisera using a large number of E. faecalis strains, we were able to classify 21 distinct serotype strains and to prepare 21 monospecific typing antisera by absorption of the antisera to the type strains with appropriate cross-agglutinating strains. When 832 E. faecalis strains were serotyped with the 21 typing antisera, 638 strains (76.7%) were typable. Thus, we propose a provisional scheme of 21 distinct serovars in E. faecalis.
TI  - Efficacy of a sustained-release device containing chlorhexidine and Ca(OH)2 in preventing secondary infection of dentinal tubules.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the antibacterial activity of Ca(OH)2 and a sustained-release device containing chlorhexidine (SRD) in both sterilization and prevention of secondary infection of the root canal system. Bovine root dentine specimens previously incubated with Streptococcus faecalis were used in this experiment. Two different formulations of the SRD (differing in their cross-linkage), Ca(OH)2 and normal saline (control) were evaluated. The degree of bacterial infection of the root canal was tested after incubation periods of 24 h, 72 h and 7 days with these medicaments. Their efficacy in preventing secondary infection after recontamination was tested after 72 h and 7 days. The results demonstrated that both formulations of the SRD significantly reduced the bacterial population in the primary infected groups, as well as preventing secondary infection of the dentinal tubules in the recontaminated group. By contrast, Ca(OH)2 did not show any antibacterial activity, and failed to sterilize the dentinal tubules or prevent secondary infection after recontamination at the time periods examined.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of the efficacy of chlorhexidine in a sustained-release device for dentine sterilization.
AB  - The aim of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine in solution and in a sustained-release device as an intracanal medication. Hollow cylindrical dentine specimens prepared from bovine incisors were incubated with Streptococcus faecalis for a period of 3 weeks. The intracanal medicaments tested were 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution (CH), chlorhexidine in a sustained-release device (1.2 mg) (SBD), camphorated paramonochlorophenol (CMCP), and a control (no medication). Each medicament was introduced into the lumen of one dentine specimen and incubated for 5 min, 24 h, 48 h or 7 days at 37 degrees C. The bacteriological samples were taken by shaving the dentine inside the lumen with dental burs ranging in size from ISO 023-033. The dentine powder was collected in test-tubes containing growth medium and incubated for 24 h. The optical density of the medium was recorded by means of a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 540 nm. There was a statistically significant difference between the control group and all the medicaments tested.
TI  - Organisms in the prostate and antibiotics in the treatment of postoperative infections.
AB  - On 24 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with preoperatively sterile urine, who also had no history of urinary tract infection, the organisms in the prostate obtained through transurethral resection as well as in the anterior urethra were isolated. In 17 patients out of 24, organisms obtained in the prostate were identical to those in the anterior urethra; therefore, it can be concluded that another 7 patients had organisms in the prostate itself before the operation. These results would suggest that sterile urine did not indicate sterile prostate and that organisms in the prostate did not always ascend from the urethra. In the patients who preoperatively received transurethral catheterizations, Streptococcus faecalis was the most predominantly isolated organism in the prostate, which was highly sensitive to ABPC and minocycline and lower to cephems. On the other hand, in the patients with no history of catheterizations, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated one, which was highly sensitive to ABPC and minocycline as well as cephems. So, in the treatment of the cases with infectious symptoms after transurethral resection of the prostate, ABPC or minocycline should be selected as first-choice drugs rather than cephems.
TI  - Natural occurrence of structures in oral streptococci and enterococci with DNA homology to Tn916.
AB  - Seventeen oral streptococci and 18 enterococci were tested for the presence of DNA sequences homologous to the conjugative transposon Tn916 encoding tetracycline resistance. All the strains were resistant to tetracyclines, including minocycline, and most of them were resistant to other antibiotics. Tn916-like structures, identified by hybridization of HincII-digested DNA, were found on the chromosomes of 11 oral streptococci and four enterococci and on two plasmids, pIP1549 and pIP1440, one harbored by an Enterococcus hirae strain and the other harbored by an Enterococcus faecalis strain. Sequences homologous to Tn916, only some of which corresponded to its internal HincII structure (Tn916-modified elements), were chromosomally located in three oral streptococci and two enterococci and were plasmid borne in pIP614 harbored by an E. faecalis strain. Nine enterococci and three oral streptococci carried either the Tet M or the Tet O determinant chromosomally, but they carried no other sequences homologous to Tn916.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Stimulation of monokine production by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) isolated from bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. LTAs from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. However, LTAs from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The kinetics of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by LTAs closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. Cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. Hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. Deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. Deacylated LTAs were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact LTAs, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. The results identify some species of LTAs as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - The killing activity of microwaves on some non-sporogenic and sporogenic medically important bacterial strains.
AB  - The killing activity of microwaves of 2450 MHz frequency and 325 W, 650 W and 1400 W power on some bacterial strains was investigated. Vegetative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis and spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillis stearothermophilus in aqueous suspensions were exposed to 325 W and 650 W waves for different lengths of time. Enterococcus faecalis and spores of B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus were exposed additionally to 1400 W waves in aqueous and 'dried' suspensions. Vegetative bacteria were promptly killed in 5 min or less, E. faecalis being slightly more resistant. Bacterial spores were only killed in aqueous suspension when a 1400 W setting was used for 10 to 20 min. Bacterial spores adhering to the tube walls after the aqueous suspension was poured out were reduced in number. We assume that the conventional microwave ovens available on the market may be used for a high level of disinfection but not for sterilization, and only then if sufficient water is present.
TI  - A host factor absent from Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis MG1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  - In matings between Lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons Tn916  and Tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. In agreement with this, the frequency of L. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant Tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. However, in intergeneric crosses with Bacillus subtilis or Enterococcus faecalis donors, Tn916 and Tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the L. lactis transconjugants. Moreover, Tn916 and Tn919 could not be transferred by conjugation from L. lactis and B. subtilis, E. faecalis or Streptococcus pyogenes. This suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in L. lactis. When cloned into E. coli with adjacent chromosomal DNA from L. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. Therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in L. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. We conclude that L. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.
TI  - [In vitro effect of new fluoroquinolones and betalactamines combinations against  enterococci].
AB  - Combinations of one of the new fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin or tosufloxacin) with a betalactam (amoxicillin, piperacillin, or imipenem) were tested in vitro using the checkboard method against 28 strains of Streptococcus faecalis recovered in 1990 from a variety of specimens. No instance of antagonism (FIC greater than 2) was recorded. Effects of the two agents were usually additive (0.5 less than FIC less than or equal to 1). An indifferent effect (1 less than FIC less than or equal to 2) was seen in 32.1% of cases (9 strains) with the amoxicillin-tosufloxacin combination. Synergy (FIC less than or equal to 0.5) was uncommon with combinations including imipenem: effects were synergistic for only three strains with imipenem and either ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin and for six strains with the imipenem-temafloxacin combination. Synergy was more common with combinations including ciprofloxacin and either piperacillin (10 strains, 35.7%) or amoxicillin (13 strains, 46.4%).
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - In-vitro activity of temafloxacin for gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of temafloxacin against aerobic Gram-positive cocci was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin and pefloxacin using the broth microdilution technique. Temafloxacin was more active than the other four fluoroquinolones, particularly for viridans streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 of temafloxacin was at least four-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for viridans streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci. The MIC50s and MIC90s of temafloxacin were equal to or lower than those of the other fluoroquinolones for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. Temafloxacin was more active against all the other Gram-positive aerobes (except Enterococcus faecalis) tested than the other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Internal mammary artery use. Sternal revascularization and experimental infection patterns.
AB  - We have described previously the acute sternal devascularization produced by mobilization of one or both internal mammary arteries (IMAs). The present experiments were conducted to examine the time course of sternal revascularization and infection patterns after IMA use. Twenty-four 8-week-old domestic pigs were obtained from a herd in which active Streptococcus faecalis had been detected in recent litters. After control blood flow procedures (microspheres) were completed, each pig underwent a median sternotomy; one or both IMAs were mobilized as a pedicle, and the sternotomy was repaired. Repeat blood flow determinations were made in half the pigs at 1 week and in the remainder after 2 weeks. The pigs were killed, the wound was examined, cultures were taken as indicated, and tissue was harvested for blood flow analysis. Despite the retention of an intact IMA on the contralateral side, persistent, significant sternal ischemia existed 2 weeks after repair. However, when both IMAs were used, the extent of devascularization was exaggerated, and revascularization was impaired further. Revascularization of intercostal muscle occurred more rapidly and was essentially returned to normal 2 weeks after sternotomy and IMA harvest. Active mediastinitis with erosion of the sternum was found in one (17%) of six pigs at 1 week and in four (67%) of six pigs at 2 weeks when the IMAs had been rotated bilaterally. No wound infections were detected in the single IMA resection group. These data suggest that bilateral IMA mobilization may delay an already slow revascularization process and predispose to infectious complications.
TI  - Structure of NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 refined at 2.16 A resolution.
AB  - The crystal structure of NADH peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.1) from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 (Enterococcus faecalis) has been refined to a resolution of 2.16 A using the simulated annealing method. The final crystallographic R-factor is 17.7% for all data in the resolution range 7 to 2.16 A. The standard deviations are 0.015 A in bond lengths and 3.0 degrees in bond angles for the final model, which includes all 447 amino acid residues, one FAD and 369 water molecules. The enzyme is a symmetrical tetramer with point group D2; the symmetry is crystallographic. The redox center of the enzyme consists of FAD and a cysteine (Cys42), which forms a sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) in its oxidized state. A histidine (His10) close to Cys42 is likely to act as an active-site base. In the analyzed crystal, the enzyme was in a non-native oxidation state with Cys42 oxidized to a sulfonic acid Cys-SO3H. The chain fold of NADH peroxidase is similar to those of disulfide oxidoreductases. A comparison with glutathione reductase, a representative of this enzyme family, is given.
TI  - Cloning, sequence and overexpression of NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Structural relationship with the flavoprotein disulfide reductases.
AB  - DNA fragments encoding streptococcal NADH peroxidase (NPXase) have been amplified, cloned and sequenced from the genome of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis 10C1 (ATCC 11700). The NPXase gene (npr) comprises 1341 base-pairs and is preceded by a typical ribosome binding site. Upstream from the structural gene, putative -10 and -35 promoter regions have been identified, as has a possible factor-independent terminator that occurs in 3'-flanking sequences. The deduced relative molecular mass (Mr = 49,551), amino acid composition and isoelectric point of NPXase are in good agreement with previous values obtained with the purified enzyme. In addition, three sequenced peptides totaling approximately 20% of the protein were located in the npr gene product. From the sequencing data the deduced NPXase sequence shares low but significant homology with the flavoprotein disulfide reductase class of enzymes ranging from 21% for glutathione reductase (GRase) to 28% for thioredoxin reductase. Alignment of NPXase to Escherichia coli GRase allowed the identification of three previously reported fingerprints for the FAD, NADP+ and central domains of GRase, in the peroxidase sequence. In addition, Cys42 of NPXase, which is present as an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid in the oxidized enzyme, aligns favorably with the charge-transfer cysteine in E. coli GRase, and both residues closely follow FAD-binding folds found near their respective amino termini. Such sequence characteristics can also be seen in mercuric reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase and trypanothione reductase, suggesting that all these enzymes may have originally diverged from a common ancestor. Sequences that are on average 50% identical with three previously reported peptides of the related streptococcal NADH oxidase were also identified in the NPXase primary structure, suggesting a strong similarity between these flavoenzymes. Using the E. coli phage T7 expression system the npr gene has now been overexpressed in an E. coli genetic background. The resultant overexpressing clone produced a recombinant NPXase that was catalytically active and immunoreactive to NPXase antisera.
TI  - Bacterial growth on suction drain tips. Prospective study of 489 clean orthopedic operations.
AB  - The study included 489 clean orthopedic operations with implantation of major foreign materials (joint replacements and internal fixations of fractures). Specimens for culture were taken from the suction drainage system, either from the drain fluid or from the drain-tube tip or from both. Six superficial and five deep infections were seen following the operations. Only two cultures of drain fluid were positive, and neither of these became infected. Positive drain-tip cultures were seen after 56 operations, and of these, five were followed by infection. The risk of infection was increased if Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Streptococcus faecalis was cultured from drain tips. Drain-tip cultures growing only coagulase-negative staphylococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, and corynebacteria were not correlated with increased risk of infection. There was a not significant tendency towards fewer infections if positive drain-tip cultures with virulent bacteria were treated with specific antibiotics.
TI  - Synergy and cumulated killing effect of the penems FCE 22101 and FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin against bacteria isolated from septicaemia.
AB  - Blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella oxytoca were tested for their synergistic and cumulated killing effect (CKE) with the new penems FCE 22101 or FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin. The tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study the CKE in vivo after antibiotic treatment of the bacteria in vitro. Synergy was observed within two to seven h with all isolates in early logarithmic phase, except with S. aureus, which was rapidly killed by the penems alone. After one h treatment with the antibiotic combinations in vitro, a CKE was demonstrated for up to six h both in vitro and in vivo. The magnitude of the CKE differed between strains and in vitro vs. in vivo.
TI  - Salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of Streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  - Interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. Streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. The salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. Salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis or A. viscosus. Adherence of S. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. Expression of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) gene in Enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated S. sanguis and A. viscosus. This interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. The results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of S. mutans to S. sanguis and A. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on S. mutans.
TI  - [The invitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against gram positive microorganisms (corrected)].
AB  - The in vitro activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against 288 gram positive cocci were determined by broth macrodilution method. MIC 90 values for teicoplanin were lmcg/ml for coagulase positive staphylococci (n = 115), 4 mcg/ml for coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 93), 0.50 mcg/ml for S. faecalis (n = 50) and 0.125 mcg/ml for S. pyogenes (n = 30). MIC 90 values for vancomycin were lmcg/ml 1 mcg/ml, 1 mcg/ml and 0.25 mcg/ml respectively. We were not able to detect in vitro resistance against teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in Osaka].
AB  - We examined MICs of 6 oral new quinolones and 4 oral cephems against bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in Osaka during the period from January to June in 1990, and the following results were obtained. 1. All species excluding Streptococcus pyogenes were more sensitive with less frequencies of resistance to new quinolones than to cephems. In new quinolones, tosufloxacin (TFLX) was the most active against Gram-positive cocci and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX had the highest activities against Gram-negative rods. 2. Resistant (MIC of CPFX greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) strains to new quinolones were observed at higher frequencies than 10% among Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Serratia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. 3. The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to new quinolones isolated from in-patients or urine was significantly higher than that from out-patients or other sources. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in resistance frequencies of P. aeruginosa due to types of patients or sources. But, there were significant differences in frequencies of resistant organisms of either species to new quinolones among hospitals. 4. Twenty-seven strains (19.7%) of 137 S. aureus strains examined were methicillin-resistant, and they were similarly resistant to new quinolones also. Methicillin susceptible S. aureus were also similarly sensitive to new quinolones.
TI  - Detection and prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in the agricultural ecosystem.
AB  - The sensitivity of four different enrichment procedures to detect Listeria monocytogenes in the presence of high levels of Streptococcus faecalis was investigated. Defined mixed cultures of Strep. faecalis and L. monocytogenes gave better results with one-stage enrichment techniques. For manure samples, however, two-stage enrichment techniques gave the best performance. The so-called cold enrichment techniques were found to be unsatisfactory for samples from natural environments. The following materials were examined for the presence of L. monocytogenes: fresh pig faeces (16% positive), fresh cattle faeces (20% positive), stored liquid manure (0% positive), manured soil samples (0% positive) and ground water samples (5% positive). After 3 weeks of storage L. monocytogenes could be detected in only one of the initially nine positive fresh faeces samples. Two months after inoculation of stored liquid pig manure, stored liquid cattle manure and soil with L. monocytogenes, this bacterium could not be traced in any of these materials. Radishes (Raphanus sativus) and carrots (Daucus carota), sown in soil inoculated with L. monocytogenes, were gathered after 3 months and examined for the presence of L. monocytogenes. Three of six radish samples were found to be positive. Remarkably, however, all carrot samples (six) were free of L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Bacteriologically stressed animal model of new closed catheter drainage system with microbicidal outlet tube.
AB  - We have used a catheterized rabbit model to test a newly developed catheter drainage system that incorporates a microbicidal outlet tube. In these tests, this new system was compared with a currently marketed closed drainage system, with daily challenge at the outlet tube using an auxotrophically marked uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. In the control series (silicone catheter connected to a standard drainage bag via a tamper-evidence seal) the challenge organism developed upstream biofilm colonization of the luminal surfaces of the catheter and drainage system that was complete in 4.6 +/- 2.1 days in 11 animals, while in 1 animal a rapid overgrowth of the system with Streptococcus faecalis developed. The presence of organisms other than the marked E. coli strain on the luminal surfaces of these control catheters showed that down stream colonization was also operative. In the test catheter drainage series, the microbicidal outlet tube insert precluded upstream colonization by the challenge organism in 12 of 16 catheters and significantly delayed (7.2 +/- 1.0 days) this colonization in the remaining 4 animals. When upstream colonization by exogenous bacteria was precluded by this effective device, downstream colonization of the drainage system by mixed populations of bacteria that probably migrated into the bladder via the extraluminal urethral route developed in some animals (6 of 16).
TI  - Distribution, antibiotic susceptibility and tolerance of bacterial isolates in culture-positive cases of endocarditis in The Netherlands.
AB  - During a two-year period data were collected nationwide in The Netherlands on 438 episodes of bacterial endocarditis (BE) in 432 patients. Of the strains isolated in these patients 419 were available for analysis. Of these, 326 were isolated in native valve endocarditis (NVE) and 93 in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Viridans streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci together constituted 87% of the isolates. More than 46% of the viridans streptococci consisted of Streptococcus sanguis. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species in the late form of PVE. The majority of the viridans streptococci and haemolytic streptococci were highly susceptible to penicillin. Five of 35 strains of coagulase negative staphylococci were resistant to methicillin. Eleven percent of a random sample of the streptococci collected were tolerant to penicillin. After repeated exposure to a concentration gradient of an appropriate beta-lactam antibiotic, this figure increased to 49%. Of the staphylococci, 5-6% of the strains were tolerant before induction and 16-20% after induction. Of the Enterococcus strains (n = 40), 12.5% showed high-level resistance to one or more aminoglycoside.
TI  - [The characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan in the spectrum of the reactivity of human lymphocytes to bacterial peptidoglycans].
AB  - The sensitivity of lymphocytes of healthy persons to S. aureus peptidoglycan as compared with that to the polyclonal stimulator zymosan C3b and peptidoglycans of other bacteria (Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bacterium bifidum) was analyzed with a test system permitting the determination of specific reactivity to peptidoglycans. The analysis showed that at the peak of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (25-30 minutes) individual reactivity to S. aureus peptidoglycan varied within wide limits (the coefficient of lymphocyte stimulation was 1.4-9.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6), exceeding sensitivity to other bacteria, as well as the values obtained in the negative control. The conclusion of the wide spread of sensitization to S. aureus peptidoglycan and the possibility of using this preparation for the study of cell-mediated immunity reactions was made.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis in neonatal infective endocarditis.
AB  
TI  - Bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  - During delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. Due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells of respiratory nasal mucosa. Bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. Bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. In mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. Results of the study performed by usual methods revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. Gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of a Streptococcus faecalis autolysin.
AB  - A Streptococcus faecalis genomic bank was obtained by partial digestion with MboI and cloning into the SalI restriction site of pTZ18R. Screening of about 60,000 Escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity was done by exposing recombinant colonies grown on medium containing lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells to chloroform and toluene vapors in order to release proteins. Because this procedure provoked cell death, colonies could not be used directly for transformant recovery; however, recovery was achieved by partial purification of plasmid DNA from active colonies on the agar plate and transformation of E. coli competent cells. About 60 recombinants were found. One of them (pSH6500) codes for a lytic enzyme active against S. faecalis and M. lysodeikticus cell walls. A shorter clone (pSH4000) was obtained by deleting an EcoRI fragment from the 6.5-kb original insert, leaving a 4-kb EcoRI-MboI insert; this subclone expressed the same lytic activity. Sequencing of a portion of pSH4000 revealed a unique open reading frame of 2,013 nucleotides coding for a 641-amino-acid (74-kDa) polypeptide and containing four 204-nucleotide direct repeats.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140, and PD 131501). A quinolone with high activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140 and PD 131501) is a new antimicrobial agent of the  piperazinyl quinolone class. Relative to other quinolones, it is a potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal drug in vitro: The microbroth 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) (in microgram/ml) was 0.25 vs 26 methicillin-resistant and -sensitive coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci and 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae; 0.5 vs 20 strains each of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecalis. The data indicate sparfloxacin to be generally superior to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, cefazolin, doxycycline, amikacin, and vancomycin against these Gram-positive bacterial groups. Additional MIC90s were determined for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (less than or equal to 0.03); Enterobacteriaceae (0.5); and Listeria monocytogenes (1). Activity was generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic-anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium cholate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine. Naturally occurring resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of 10(-8) or lower.
TI  - Introduction of Tn916 and pAM beta 1 into Streptococcus bovis JB1 by conjugation.
AB  - The transposon Tn916 and self-mobilizing plasmid pAM beta 1 were conjugated from  Enterococcus faecalis to the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis JB1. Transconjugants were identified by resistance to tetracycline (Tn916) or erythromycin (pAM beta 1) and by Southern hybridization analyses. Transfer frequencies were 7.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-6) per recipient cell for Tn916 and pAM beta 1, respectively. The transconjugants JB1/Tn916 and JB1/pAM beta 1 were used as donors for matings with E. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. While pAM beta 1 was successfully transferred to all three organisms, Tn916 was transferred only into B. subtilis and B. fibrisolvens at very low frequencies. This is the first report of conjugal DNA transfers between two ruminal organisms.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide base sequence analysis of a spectinomycin adenyltransferase AAD(9) determinant from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis LDR55, a human clinical isolate, is resistant to tetracycline (Tcr), erythromycin (Emr), and high levels (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin (Spr) but not streptomycin. Filter matings between strain LDR55 and E. faecalis OG1-RF produced transconjugants with the following resistance phenotypes: Tcr Emr Spr, Tcr Emr, Tcr Spr, and Tcr only but never Emr or Spr only. The genetic determinant encoding resistance to spectinomycin was cloned in Streptococcus sanguis Challis from pDL55, a 26-kb plasmid harbored by a Tcr Spr transconjugant. Subcloning experiments yielded a 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment that encoded very high-level Spr in S. sanguis (10 mg/ml) and Escherichia coli (50 mg/ml). Cell extracts of cultures obtained from Spr strains expressed adenylating activity for spectinomycin but not for streptomycin, indicating that Spr was due to an AAD(9) activity. The nucleotide base sequence of the 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment contained a single 750-base open reading frame. The protein predicted from the open reading frame consisted of 250 amino acids and had a calculated size of approximately 28,000 daltons, similar to the size estimated from maxicell analysis (29,000 daltons). The deduced amino acid sequence of the streptococcal AAD(9) was compared with that of the AAD(9) encoded by staphylococcal transposon Tn554. The two proteins shared approximately 39% amino acid identity, which was expanded to 53% when conservative amino acid changes were included. When the streptococcal protein was compared with an AAD(3")(9) protein of E. coli, the degrees of identity were 27 and 47%, on the basis of actual amino acids and conservative replacements, respectively. The cloning and nucleotide base sequence analyses of the spectinomycin AAD(9) determinant from E. faecalis that results in high-level Spr when transferred to S. sanguis or E. coli are presented.
TI  - Bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  - Ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. In addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. Fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. The most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, black-pigmented Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented Bacteroides, Veillonella, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans. Of the 50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. This study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.
TI  - Two lipoyl domains in the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase chain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A fragment of DNA incorporating the gene, pdhC, that encodes the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) chain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Streptococcus faecalis was cloned and a DNA sequence of 2360 bp was determined. The pdhC gene (1620 bp) corresponds to an E2 chain of 539 amino acid residues, Mr 56,466, comprising two lipoyl domains, a peripheral subunit-binding domain and an acetyltransferase domain, linked together by regions of polypeptide chain rich in alanine, proline and charged amino acids. The S. faecalis E2 chain differs in the number of its lipoyl domains from the E2 chains of all bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes hitherto described.
TI  - Use of corticosterone and ampicillin for treatment of Streptococcus faecalis infection in chickens.
AB  - Chickens were selectively bred for either high-antibody (HA) or low-antibody (LA) response to sheep erythrocytes. From 6 to 31 days after Streptococcus faecalis challenge exposure, LA-line chickens maintained a greater percentage of the prechallenge-exposure body weight and had lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio than did HA-line chickens. The optimal dose of corticosterone (30 mg/kg of feed) was effective in maintaining postchallenge-exposure body weight greater than that of controls. Ampicillin (20 mg/d) alone was ineffective in almost all experiments. Treatment with 30 mg of corticosterone/kg of feed plus ampicillin resulted in increased body weight response to S faecalis infection when treatment was initiated 1 day before or 2 days after challenge exposure. Treatment with corticosterone was more effective in HA- than in LA-line chickens. Treatment before challenge exposure was more effective than treatment 2 days after challenge exposure.
TI  - Relationship of the chemical structure and immunobiological activities of lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus hirae) ATCC 9790.
AB  - Two molecular species of lipoteichoic acid (LTA 1 and LTA 2) were isolated from whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus hirae) ATCC 9790 by hydrophobic chromatography on Octyl Sepharose CL-4B. Chemical analysis revealed that LTA 1 and LTA 2 contained two and four acyl lipid anchors respectively. LTA 1 was less active than LTA 2 in inducing cytokines, except interleukin-1 (IL-1), but their in vivo antitumour effects were similar. LTA 2 was a potent inducer of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) production and had excellent antitumour activity against Meth A fibrosarcoma established in mice. Deacylation of LTA 2 by alkaline hydrolysis abolished these biological activities. The phosphatidylglycolipid fraction derived from LTA 2 after acid hydrolysis could also induce TNF, IFN, and IL-1 production, as well as having antitumour activity against Meth A fibrosarcoma. Therefore, the lipid anchor portion of S. faecalis LTA may play an important role in the manifestation of these various biological activities.
TI  - Differentiation of enterococci from other group D streptococci by means of a specific monoclonal antibody.
AB  - We report on the specificity of a monoclonal antibody which reacts with autoclaved extracts of four species of enterococci but does not react to the same extent with similar extracts from two non-enterococcal group D streptococci. The monoclonal antibody also reacts specifically with purified lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis but not significantly with purified lipoteichoic acid from the non-enterococcal species Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus. The specific antigen detected with this antibody could correlate with the definition of the enterococcus subgroup of the streptococci which would provide further evidence that this sub-group is taxonomically distinct from the other group D streptococci.
TI  - Distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as Streptococcus species and Lactobacillus species. The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be Met-Glu-Asn-Phe-Phe-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-XXX-Met-Gly-Thr-Met-Ala-Thr-Glu-Ser- Phe-.
TI  - Composition of the enterococcal and streptococcal intestinal flora of poultry.
AB  - Identification to species level showed that Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium largely dominated the enterococcal and streptococcal gut flora of 1-d-old chicks. Enterococcus faecalis was rare in 3- to 5-week-old broilers. Two species, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus alactolyticus, were isolated from nearly all broilers examined. Enterococcus hirae and Ent. durans were found in the small intestines of this category of poultry. In layers and parent stock of over 12 weeks of age, Ent. cecorum dominated with Strep. alactolyticus ranking next. Other species were isolated irregularly. Enterococcus avium and Ent. gallinarum, originally described from chickens, were rarely found. These species did not appear to belong to the normal intestinal flora of poultry.

TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140 and CI-978), a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, against Haemophilus and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (AT-4140 and CI-978) was evaluated for activity against 194 clinical isolates of staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Haemophilus sp. The MIC of sparfloxacin for greater than 93% of the strains tested was less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. Sparfloxacin demonstrated increased activity against enterococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, and anaerobic cocci when compared with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [The effect of various culture parameters on the yield of restriction endonuclease Sfa NI].
AB  - A simple technique is proposed for testing the restriction endonuclease Sfa NI activity in lysates of Streptococcus faecalis cells. The technique was used to study the effect of inorganic phosphate and the growth phase on the enzyme yield. Conditions were chosen that provide a high yield of the Sfa NI activity and a significantly reduced level of nucleases in the cells.
TI  - Enumeration by a miniaturized method of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  - Counts of Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. Escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. Consequently the use of the ratio E. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. Enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces, Streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also of pig faeces whereas Enterococcus durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. Streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in the medium.
TI  - Comparison of the new MicroScan Pos MIC Type 6 panel and AMS-Vitek Gram Positive  Susceptibility Card (GPS-TA) for detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in Enterococcus species.
AB  - We compared the MicroScan Pos MIC Type 6 panel and AMS-Vitek Gram Positive Susceptibility Card (GPS-TA) to agar dilution screen plates for the detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in 182 enterococcal isolates. The specificity of the two commercial systems was 100%, with the exception of one susceptible isolate found to be streptomycin resistant by the Vitek system. The MicroScan and Vitek systems had comparable sensitivities for the detection of gentamicin resistance (90 and 95% respectively) and streptomycin resistance (85 and 78%, respectively). These results suggest that screening tests such as agar dilution screen plates, broth dilution, or disk diffusion should continue to be used to detect high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance.
TI  - Detection of enterococcal high-level aminoglycoside resistance with MicroScan freeze-dried panels containing newly modified medium and Vitek Gram-Positive Susceptibility cards.
AB  - Both conventional and modified MicroScan Type 5 panels and Vitek Gram-Positive Susceptibility cards were compared with agar dilution screen plates for their abilities to detect high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin in 235 enterococcal isolates, including 167 Enterococcus faecalis and 63 E. faecium isolates. The modified Type 5 panels contained dextrose-phosphate broth instead of Mueller-Hinton broth in their high-level-resistance screen wells. The sensitivities for detection of gentamicin and streptomycin high-level resistance were 100 and 100% (E. faecalis) and 100 and 94% (E. faecium) for the modified MicroScan panels, 100 and 89% (E. faecalis) and 100 and 98% (E. faecium) for the conventional MicroScan panels, and 81 and 86% (E. faecalis) and 85 and 94% (E. faecium) for the Vitek cards. All specificities were 100% except for the Vitek cards with streptomycin, where it was 96%. Isolates that showed resistance on the streptomycin agar screen plates were rescreened on plates containing 32,000 micrograms/ml to detect ribosomally mediated resistance. For all three systems, every failure to detect streptomycin high-level resistance occurred in isolates with enzymatic, not ribosomal, resistance. The modified MicroScan Type 5 panels are a suitable method for detecting enterococcal high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin. The Vitek cards are too insensitive for this purpose.
TI  - Gentamicin-resistant, streptomycin-susceptible Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis bacteremia.

TI  - Synergistic bactericidal activity of rat serum with vancomycin against enterococci.
AB  - Animal models of infectious diseases may not predict clinical efficacy when species-related factors come into play. Recently, unexpected bactericidal activity of vancomycin alone against enterococci was observed in a rat model of endocarditis. A factor or factors in rat serum, but not rabbit or human serum, enhanced in vitro killing by vancomycin in four of five clinical isolates of enterococci. Bactericidal activity was maintained on dilution of rat serum to 5.0% and after exposure of serum to 56 degrees C for 30 min. Activity was lost by heating at 60 degrees C for 2 h, ultrafiltration, or absorption with bentonite or heat-killed bacteria. Rat serum appears to contain a factor or factors that contribute bactericidal activity to vancomycin, a drug normally bacteriostatic for these enterococci. The mechanism by which this factor enhances killing of enterococci by vancomycin is unknown.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance heterogeneity in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The tetracycline (Tet) determinants, which encode resistance either to tetracyclines without minocycline (Tcr) or to tetracyclines including minocycline (Tcr-Mnr), of 30 wild-type clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium were identified and localized. The Tet determinants were transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor, as follows: Tcr, 6 strains; Tcr-Mnr, 14 strains; both Tcr and Tcr-Mnr, 6 strains; no detectable transfer, 4 strains. Classes L (Tcr phenotype) and M and O (Tcr-Mnr phenotype) of the Tet determinants were identified by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. The Tet L determinant was plasmid-borne in 18 strains and was chromosomal in 2 strains. Tet M was chromosomal in 27 strains and plasmid-borne (pIP1534) in 1 strain; pIP1534 also carried Tet L. Tet M was located on Tn916-like elements in 22 strains and on a Tn916-modified element in 1 strain. Tet O was detected in only one strain in which it was plasmid-borne. Both Tet L and Tet M determinants were carried by 19 strains. One strain carried, in addition to chromosomal nonconjugative Tet L and Tet M determinants, a conjugative Tcr-Mnr marker which did not correspond to any Tet determinant tested in this study. These results attest to the genetic complexity of tetracycline resistance in E. faecium strains.
TI  - Comparative analysis of Enterococcus faecalis sex pheromone plasmids identifies a single homologous DNA region which codes for aggregation substance.
AB  - An analysis of the 11 known sex pheromone plasmids of Enterococcus faecalis was performed by DNA-DNA hybridization. Plasmids pAD1, pJH2, and pBEM10 turned out to be closely related, whereas pAM373 showed only weak homology with pAD1. A comparison of the hemolysin/bacteriocin determinants of pAD1, pJH2, and pOB1 revealed strong similarities at the DNA level. Our main finding was that one DNA region is conserved among all sex pheromone plasmids, with pAM373 again being an exception; for pAD1 this region was shown earlier to code for aggreagation substance. Detailed hybridization studies of the genes for this plasmid-coded adhesin, which is responsible for cell-cell contact during conjugative transfer via the so-called sex pheromone system of E. faecalis, support the idea of their common origin.
TI  - Genetic transformation of various species of Enterococcus by electroporation.
AB  - A transformation system for Enterococcus faecalis was developed which uses untreated (i.e., non-protoplasted) cells and the electroporation technique. The optimized protocol resulted in transformation efficiencies of up to 4 x 10(6) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA. All strains of E. faecalis tested could be transformed by this method, albeit with differing transformation efficiencies. Using the protocol optimized for E. faecalis we successfully transformed Enterococcus faecium, E. hirae, E. malodoratus and E. mundtii.
TI  - Synergistic killing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci of classes A, B, and C by combinations of vancomycin, penicillin, and gentamicin.
AB  - Using both high and low inocula for time-kill curves, we examined the antibiotic  killing of clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, and E. gallinarum) belonging to phenotypic resistance classes A, B, and C. None were resistant to high levels (greater than 500 mg/liter) of gentamicin. Vancomycin-penicillin-gentamicin resulted in 2 or more logs of killing above that of the most effective two-antibiotic combination for all strains except two of three E. gallinarum (VanC) strains and a constitutive mutant of a VanB strain. This strategy may be useful clinically.
TI  - [Group D streptococci and enterococci: identification, sensitivity to antibiotics and a study of the high level resistance to aminosides (Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis)].
AB  - 197 strains of enterococcus and group D Streptococcus were isolated from human material at Charles Nicolle Hospital (Tunis) and identified by biochemical tests: 174, Enterococcus faecalis, 6 Enterococcus faecium, 2 Enterococcus durans and 15 Streptococcus bovis. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied: all Enterococcus faecium were resistant at least to one antibiotic, 15% of Enterococcus faecalis were sensitive for all antibiotics tested the other species were frequently sensitive. High level resistance to aminoglycosides were frequent in Enterococcus faecalis 40%: among these strains high level resistance to gentamicin accounts for 12% and 18 frequently associated with resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin, this situation present therapeutic problems in case of severe infection.
TI  - Improved electroporation and cloning vector system for gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A protocol for transformation of intact Enterococcus faecalis cells by electroporation was developed through a systematic examination of the effects of changes in various parameters, including (i) growth conditions; (ii) composition of the electroporation solution; (iii) electroporation conditions, such as field strength and resistance; (iv) size, concentration, and purity of DNA used for transformation; and (v) conditions used to select for transformants. Key features of this protocol include the use of exponential-phase cells grown in inhibitory concentrations of glycine and the use of an acidic sucrose electroporation solution. Frequencies of greater than 2 x 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA were obtained for E. faecalis cells, whereas various strains of streptococci and Bacillus anthracis were transformed at frequencies of 10(3) to 10(4) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA with the same protocol. A novel Escherichia coli-Streptococcus and Enterococcus shuttle cloning vector, pDL276, was constructed for use in conjunction with the electroporation system. This vector features a multiple cloning site region flanked by E. coli transcription termination sequences, a relatively small size (less than 7 kb), and a kanamycin resistance determinant expressed in both gram-positive and gram-negative hosts. Various enterococcal and streptococcal DNA sequences were cloned in E. coli (including sequences that could not be cloned on other vectors) and were returned to the original host by electroporation. The vector and electroporation system was also used to clone directly into E. faecalis.
TI  - Evidence for clonal spread of a single strain of beta-lactamase-producing Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis to six hospitals in five states.
AB  - Beta-lactamase-producing (Bla+) enterococci have been reported in three state and two countries. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to compare 14 Bla+ Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis isolated from hospitalized patients in seven states and three continents. The restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of isolates from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Lebanon, and Argentina were all markedly different, indicating that these were different strains. However, isolates from Delaware, Texas, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), Florida, and Virginia were similar, indicating that these isolates were derivatives of a single strain. This conclusion was supported by hybridization using individual fragments as probes. Spread of Bla+ enterococci within the hospital setting was also demonstrated. These findings illustrate the value of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for epidemiologic analyses and support the importance of identifying and containing organisms with new resistance properties in an effort to decrease their transmission to and from, as well as within, hospitals.
TI  - Bacteriolytic effect of teicoplanin.
AB  - The glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin belongs to the same group as vancomycin and ristocetin and is a valuable tool for studying the autolytic system of sensitive Gram-positive bacteria. Teicoplanin, at a concentration of 1 microgram ml-1, caused rapid lysis of exponential phase cells of Streptococcus faecalis. Bacillus spp. were most sensitive to the antibiotic; effective lysis occurred at 0.1 microgram teicoplanin ml-1. The bacteriolytic effect depended on the antibiotic concentration, the growth phase and growth rate of the target organism. Antibiotic added to overnight cultures did not cause lysis. Mg2+ (50 mM) was unable to prevent lysis. Mutants with decreased autolytic activity were more resistant to teicoplanin and lysed more slowly than the wild-type. Growth of bacteria in slightly acidic medium protected the cells against the lytic effect of teicoplanin typically observed at pH 7 or 8. This pH-dependent antibiotic tolerance was demonstrated with both bacilli and streptococci. Bacterial lysis was prevented by the presence of Ac-L-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Ala and normal growth was observed when this peptide was added simultaneously with teicoplanin. Bacteria pretreated with teicoplanin, washed and transferred to fresh medium or buffers behaved as if the antibiotic was still present; in neutral or slightly alkaline conditions strong lysis occurred, whereas in acidic buffer only bacteriostasis was observed. In contrast to vancomycin, teicoplanin induced some lysis of bacteria in hypertonic media, presumably by affecting the integrity of the cell membrane.
TI  - Separation of the poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids of Enterococcus faecalis Kiel 27738, Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides DSM 20343 into molecular species by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A.
AB  - This study shows for the first time microheterogeneity of 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids. The lipoteichoic acids investigated were those of Enterococcus faecalis Kiel 27738 (I), Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) ATCC 9790 (II), and Leuconostoc mesenteroides DMS 20343 (III). Lipoteichoic acids II and III are partially substituted by mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl residues with (1----2) interglycosidic linkages. Lipoteichoic acid I is substituted with alpha-kojibiosyl residues only. Lipoteichoic acids I and III additionally carry D-alanine ester. Lipoteichoic acids were separated on columns of concanavalin-A-Sepharose according to their increasing number of glycosyl substituents per chain. It was evident that all molecular species are usually glycosylated and that alanine ester and glycosyl residues occur on the same chains. The chain lengths of lipoteichoic acid I and II vary between 9-40 glycerophosphate residues, whereas those of lipoteichoic acid III appear to be uniform (33 +/- 2 residues). Molecular species differ in the extent of glycosylation but their content of alanyl residues is fairly constant. All lipoteichoic acids contain a small fraction (5-15%) different in composition from the bulk and most likely reflecting an early stage of biosynthesis. Two procedures for chain length determination of poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids are described.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic injectable pristinamycin, against  staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic pristinamycin, was compared with the activities of vancomycin, oxacillin, ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin against five Staphylococcus species, five Streptococcus species, and four Enterococcus species. For staphylococci, MICs were 0.13 to 1 microgram/ml and the MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) were 0.13 to 0.5 microgram/ml; there were no differences between oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains. For streptococci, MICs were 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s were 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml; viridans group streptococci were the least susceptible streptococci. For enterococci, MICs were 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml and MIC90s were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis was the least susceptible. Vancomycin was the only comparative drug with consistent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci. With RP 59500, raising the inoculum 100-fold, lowering the pH of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth to 5.5, or omitting cation supplementation had little effect on MICs, but 50% serum increased MICs 2 to 4 dilution steps. The differences between MBCs and MICs were greater for staphylococci and enterococci than for streptococci. Time-kill studies with 24 strains indicated that RP 59500 concentrations 2-, 4-, and 16-fold greater than the MICs usually killed bacteria of each species at similar rates; reductions in CFU per milliliter were less than those observed with oxacillin or vancomycin against staphylococci and less than those observed with ampicillin against enterococci. RP 59500 antagonized the bactericidal activities of oxacillin and gentamicin against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and that of ampicillin against E. faecalis ATCC 29212. Against the latter, combination with gentamicin was indifferent. RP 59500 has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci; combining it with other drugs is not advantageous.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of Vitek gram-positive identification system and API Rapid Strep system for identification of Streptococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - The Vitek Gram-positive identification system (GPI, Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) and the API Rapid Strep system (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY) were evaluated for species identification of streptococci isolated from bovine mammary glands and compared to conventional biochemical methods. A total of 144 strains including Streptococcus uberis (60), S. dysgalactiae (32), S. agalactiae (15), S. bovis (15), Enterococcus faecium (10) and Ent. faecalis (12) were evaluated. All reference strains were identified correctly by both systems. Vitek GPI card system identified 94.4% of strains, including 95% of S. uberis, 93.8% of S. dygalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae and S. bovis II, 90% of Ent. faecium and 100% of Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with a 90-99% level of confidence, with an average of 8 h needed for identification. The API Rapid Strep system identified 96.5% of strains correctly, including 95% of S. 96.9% of S. dysgalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae, and 100% of S. bovis II, Ent. faecium, and Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with excellent level of identification. With the exception of S. uberis, most strains were identified at 4 h of incubation.
TI  - Upper genital tract isolates at delivery as predictors of post-cesarean infections among women receiving antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  - The introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean delivery has decreased the risk of postpartum endometritis and wound infection, but factors that contribute to prophylaxis failure are not understood. To determine factors that might contribute to postpartum infections following antibiotic prophylaxis, we cultured amniotic fluid, decidua, and chorioamniotic membrane specimens for anaerobic and facultative bacteria and for genital mycoplasmas at cesarean delivery. Women were assessed daily for the development of infections, and if endometritis developed, a protected endometrial culture was obtained. Postpartum endometritis developed in 16 and wound infection in four of 102 women. Infection rates were similar for women receiving cefotetan (N = 50) or cefoxitin (N = 52) for prophylaxis. The isolation of group B streptococcus (P less than .001) or Enterococcus faecalis (P = .03) from the upper genital tract at delivery was significantly associated with postpartum endometritis. Antibiotic-resistant organisms (other than enterococci) were recovered uncommonly at delivery or with postpartum infections. Group B streptococcus was susceptible to the prophylactic agents used, suggesting that virulence factors other than antibiotic resistance are important for the development of postpartum endometritis. Group B streptococcus, E faecalis, and bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis were recovered from the endometrium at the time of postpartum endometritis.

TI  - Chemical mechanism and rate-limiting steps in the reaction catalyzed by Streptococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase.
AB  - The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters V, V/KNADH, and V/KH2O2 has been determined for the flavoenzyme NADH peroxidase. Both V/KNADH and V/KH2O2 decrease as groups exhibiting pK's of 9.2 and 9.9, respectively, are deprotonated. The V profile decreases by a factor of 5 as a group exhibiting a pK of 7.2 is deprotonated. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on NADH oxidation are observed on V only, and the magnitude of DV is independent of H2O2 concentration at pH 7.5. DV/KNADH is pH independent and equal to 1.0 between pH 6 and pH 9.5, but DV is pH dependent, decreasing from a value of 7.2 at pH 5.5 to 1.9 at pH 9.5. The shape of the DV versus pH profile parallels that observed in the V profile and yields a similar pK of 6.6 for the group whose deprotonation decreases DV. Solvent kinetic isotope effects obtained with NADH or reduced nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide as the variable substrate are observed on V only, while equivalent solvent kinetic isotope effects on V and V/K are observed when H2O2 is used as the variable substrate. In all cases linear proton inventories are observed. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on V for NADH oxidation decrease as the solvent isotopic composition is changed from H2O to D2O. These data are consistent with a change in the rate-limiting step from a step in the reductive half-reaction at low pH to a step in the oxidative half-reaction at high pH. Analysis of the multiple kinetic isotope effect data suggests that at high D2O concentrations the rate of a single proton transfer step in the oxidative half-reaction is slowed. These data are used to propose a chemical mechanism involving the pH-dependent protonation of a flavin hydroxide anion, following flavin peroxide bond cleavage.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - Isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in haematologic patients.
AB  - After the occurrence of septicaemia with a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain in a patient, it was decided to determine the number of carriers of vancomycin-resistant cocci among haematologic patients. During a period of six months 135 stool samples from 25 children, and 400 samples from 70 adults were studied. All samples from the children were negative for vancomycin-resistant cocci. Nine of the adult patients had cultures positive for cocci, all identified as enterococci, which were highly resistant to vancomycin (MIC greater than 250 micrograms/ml), sensitive to amoxicillin, moderately resistant to gentamicin, slightly resistant to teicoplanin, and sensitive to daptomycin. None of these patients had been given vancomycin prior to the isolation of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  - Growth characteristics of enterococci isolated from Laban Rayeb.
AB  - Eleven strains of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis isolated from Laban Rayeb, a type of fermented milk, had been studied when grew in milk. Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis strains 19 and 22 were the most active strains in the production of lactic acid, acetaldehyde and diacetyl. Both strains exhibited a high proteolytic activity besides a good clean flavour. Based on the obtained results, Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis 19 and 22 could be used to bring about the lactic fermentation during the manufacture of some cultured dairy products.
TI  - Inactivation of metronidazole by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which Ent. faecalis strains and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured in the same liquid medium. All of the tested Ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates) were able to protect the B. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal MIC. Different strains of Streptococcus (14), Staphylococcus aureus (10), Staph, epidermidis (10) and Escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. When Ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different B. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by HPLC. Concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains was observed compared with Bacteroides strains cultured alone. Sonicated cell extracts of Ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.
TI  - Identification of a region that influences host range of the streptococcal conjugative plasmid pIP501.
AB  - pIP501 is a member of a group of conjugative plasmids that are self-transmissible to a wide variety of streptococci as well as to other gram-positive bacteria. Several pIP501 restriction fragment deletion derivatives have been isolated and characterized. In this paper we describe one such derivative (pVA1702) which was conjugally proficient but had a limited host range. The loss of host range ability was seen as decreased conjugal transfer from Enterococcus faecalis to Streptococcus sanguis and was coincident with the deletion of a 4.5-kb DNA fragment. Transformation of pVA1702 into S. sanguis also was dramatically reduced as compared to its progenitor, suggesting the 4.5-kb fragment encoded a factor(s) necessary for stable maintenance in this host but not in E. faecalis. These observations suggest that pIP501 employs specific mechanisms enabling its maintenance in certain gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies of the filtration behavior of bacteria and organic particles in porous groundwater conductors. Fundamentals and methods].
AB  - In subsurface aquatic environments two groups of micro-organisms are observed: allochthonous bacteria and viruses, which as contaminants are eliminated from water after some time, and autochthonous groundwater micro-organisms, which belong to the natural subsurface environment and may reach very high abundances under favourable conditions--especially in the presence of a high nutrient supply. The migration of micro-organisms is controlled by flow length dependent transport processes (advection--dispersion, adsorption--desorption), and predominantly by filtration. This can be described on the basis of an expanded advection--dispersion concept. The filter effects in a certain porous aquifer can be quantified by the filter efficiency (filter factor) as a measure of the specific decrease of an initial concentration on a certain flow length. Recent laboratory experiments show that for sand the filter factor depends on the respective microbial species and is highly correlated to the effective grain diameter of the porous material, which is routinely determined in hydrogeology. Experiments with columns filled with quartz sand using the bacteria species Escherichia coli ATCC 11229, Pseudomonas cepacia DSM 50181, Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 6569, and polystyrene beads with similar density and diameters show that the filter factor is controlled by the grain size of filter material, the flow velocity, the diameter of the particle and the ionic strength of the water: The filter factor is specific for each microbial species for the same conditions of the aquatic environment. The filter factor decreases one order of magnitude if the flow velocity increases in the same order. A major control of the filter factor is the grain size. Conventionally the grain size is used as characteristic length instead of the pore size which, although it should be the real reference date, is relatively difficult to measure. For the assessment of the filter factor, the grain size d10, taken from the grain size distribution curve, can be used. The influence of the particle diameter on the filter factor, which was predicted by the filtration theory, was confirmed. The minimum values of the filter factor were encountered at particle diameters of about 1 micron, which is about the size of bacteria. The filter factor is influenced strongly by the ionic strength in water with low ionic strength, whereas in water of higher ionic strength its influence can be neglected. These relationships can be formulated into empirical equations, which allow prediction of the filter factor for given hydraulic conditions.
TI  - Influence of bacteria on Clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
AB  - When monoflora chickens with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with Clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in Gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. Approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of C. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. C. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/g after inoculation 10(8) CFU broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. When C. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, C. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. These findings indicate that the pathogenicity of C. perfringens was suppressed by L. acidophilus or S. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.
TI  - [Isolated tricuspid endocarditis. Apropos of a case caused by Streptococcus D bovis and faecalis occurring after coloscopy].
AB  - A 59-year-old chronic alcoholic male, with no cardiac past history, was hospitalised with septicemia 5 months after the endoscopic removal of 2 benign intestinal polyps. The diagnosis of tricuspid endocarditis was possible only 2 months later on the basis of echocardiography requested because of the onset of a tricuspid systolic murmur. Blood cultures revealed the presence in succession of streptococcus D fecalis then bovis. Antibiotics, changed several times because of the onset of complications (allergy, agranulocytosis), failed to deal with the problem of infection as shown by the development of several septic pulmonary emboli which finally resulted in total tricuspidectomy with neither immediate nor secondary valve replacement. The authors use this clinical case to review the characteristics of tricuspid endocarditis, the incidence of which is on the increase in certain etiological contexts (staphylococcal endocarditis in drug addicts or secondary to central vascular lines). They stress that the clinical picture is often confusing since the murmur of tricuspid incompetence is absent in 2/3 of cases. Echocardiography must therefore be requested routinely in all septicemias, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and assessment of the risk of pulmonary embolism (risk if vegetation greater than 10 mm). The nature of the organism responsible may be suggestive of certain etiologies. Thus malignant disease of the colon should be sought if the bacterium is a streptococcus D bovis. Apart from antibiotics, treatment must include effective anticoagulation to decrease the risk of embolic recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - Spontaneous contrast in the pericardial sac caused by gas-forming organisms.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with a variety of  microorganisms. The case presented herein has unusual manifestations of contrast echoes on two-dimensional echocardiography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pericarditis caused by gas-forming group D Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae with pyopericardium, resulting in contrast echoes on the two-dimensional echocardiographic image.
TI  - Effects of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, and glycopeptides against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Activities of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, teicoplanin,  and vancomycin against 11 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium highly resistant to glycopeptides, three plasmid-cured derivatives, eight E. faecalis and E. faecium transconjugants, and two susceptible recipient strains were tested. A marked synergy between penicillins or imipenem and glycopeptides against the glycopeptide-resistant strains but not against the glycopeptide-susceptible strains was observed by the double-disk agar diffusion assay. The synergy of combinations of amoxicillin, imipenem, penicillin G, or piperacillin with vancomycin or teicoplanin against resistant strains was confirmed by the checkerboard technique. The fractional inhibitory concentration indexes were generally below 0.25, except for one strain of E. faecium resistant to high levels of penicillin G. However, the combinations were not bactericidal as tested by time-killing experiments, and high concentrations (64 micrograms/ml) of amoxicillin, penicillin G, or piperacillin combined with 8 micrograms of vancomycin or teicoplanin per ml tended to be antagonistic. Addition of 4 micrograms of gentamicin per ml to these combinations enhanced their bactericidal effect, but they occasionally remained slightly less effective than beta-lactams associated with gentamicin. The combination of 10 micrograms of daptomycin per ml with gentamicin was bactericidal after 6 h against 11 glycopeptide-resistant strains.
TI  - Natural transfer of conjugative transposon Tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative streptococcal transposon Tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. Enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for Alcaligenes eutrophus, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). No transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. Mating of an E. coli strain carrying Tn916 yielded transconjugants with Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). Acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. The results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as Tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially contributing to bacterial evolution.

The therapeutic effect of each medicaments depends on physical and chemical characteristic of additional components. The aim of the paper is to research the sensitivity of Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans to different water solution concentrations of calcium hydroxide. As solid plates, Bacto-Mitis-Salivarius agar was used for S. mutans, Torlak blood agar for S. faecalis and Sabourand agar "Torlak" for C. albicans. The holes were drilled in solid plates and were filled by 0.2 ml of water solutions of Ca(OH)2. Preparations, created as described were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C in the period of 48 hrs. Results were read after 24 as well as after 48 hrs. The examined solutions of Ca(OH)2, revealed the highest antimicrobic effect after 24 hrs. The result remained unchanged even after 48 hrs. The inhibition of S. mutans growth on the solid plate occurred with the concentration of Ca(OH)2 solution from 271.18 x 10(-2) mol/dm3 and pH 12.76. The growth of S. faecalis at the solid plate was inhibited with the concentration of 3335.21 x 10(-3) mol/dm3 and pH 12.82. The inhibition of C. albicans growth on solid plate occurred with the concentration of Ca(OH)2 solution from 1023.20 x 10(-3) mol/dm3 and pH 12.84. The difference in the sensitivity of the examined microorganisms at the same concentrations of Ca(OH)2 solution was observed.
TI  - [Phlegmon of the mouth floor with extremely severe course].
AB  - A case of the 38-years old patient with a severe streptococcal phlegmon fundi oris and secondary deficiency of gamma-globulins was reported. The patient was successfully treated by surgery, proper antibiotico-therapy and immunoregulation.
TI  - Application of the polymerase chain reaction to study the M protein(-like) gene family in beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - Evaluation of homologous regions of published M protein (emm) gene sequences from group A streptococci (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) was used to design three primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and three oligonucleotide probe sequences internal to the amplified products. One set of primers and corresponding probe should detect and lead to amplification of emm(-like) genes of virtually every type ("all M"), another ("SOR-M") should only amplify emm(-like) genes from GAS negative for serum opacity reaction (SOR) and the third ("SOR+ M") should expand only emm(-like) genes from SOR+ GAS. Using the "allM" primer pair for PCR on the genomic DNA from GAS of 29 different M types as well as from a group C and a group G streptococcal isolate, DNA fragments within the expected size range were amplified in every assay. All PCR products reacted with the "allM" probe. Related sequences were not detected in genomic DNA of an S. agalactiae and an Enterococcus faecalis isolate. Applying the "SOR-M" and "SOR+M" primers to identical assays led to mutually exclusive amplification products. The "SOR-M" and "SOR+M" probes hybridized only to their corresponding products. Exceptions to this exclusivity were the SOR- GAS of M types 3, 8, 27, 34, 42, 67, and 69, which consistently reacted only with the "SOR+M" primer/probe set. Analysis of sequence data from the amplified emm(-like) 2, 3, 18, and 19 genes revealed interesting specific features such as conserved gaps in the C-terminal sequence regions from SOR+ and the exceptional SOR- GAS strains. These data indicate the existence of a subgroup of strains among SOR- GAS and may advance our understanding of phylogenetic relationship between different serotypes of GAS.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and cefazolin in combination with vancomycin.
AB  - 207 clinical isolates from strains of patients from the University Children's Hospital of Kiel were investigated for their in vitro activity with the agar dilution method against flomoxef and cefazolin (alone and partially in combination with vancomycin). Staphylococci were also tested with other cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefotetan and latamoxef). Flomoxef and cefazolin always acted more vigorously on staphylococci than the other cephalosporins. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains against flomoxef and cefazolin did not occur but was found in 15 and 5 of 98 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis strains were always resistant against both drugs; Streptococcus faecium strains were only moderately sensitive. Combined testing of flomoxef or cefazolin with vancomycin showed synergism in almost all staphylococcal strains. Synergism was stronger when S. epidermidis strains were only weakly sensitive to or resistant against flomoxef and cefazolin in comparison to highly sensitive strains. Flomoxef (or cefazolin) acted synergistically in combination with vancomycin on E. faecalis and S. faecium with the exception of two strains of E. faecalis which showed an additive effect of both drugs.
TI  - [Kinetics of bacterial wash-out in the Haemonetics Cell Saver III].
AB  - Autologous, outdated blood units were inoculated with four types of bacteria--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus--in two concentrations (10e4, 10e6) to test the effect of the washing procedure (Cell Saver III Haemonetics) on the elimination of bacteria. The elimination rate ranged from 17% (Streptococcus faec. 10e4) to 96% (Pseudomonas aer. 10e6). These results confirm the routine use of wash centrifuge systems (type Cell Saver) to process shed wound blood as well as drainage blood for autologous transfusions.
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of Enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences of eleven Enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. Comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. The species E. avium, E. malodoratus, E. pseudoavium and E. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did E. durans, E. faecium, E. hirae and E. mundtii and the pair of species E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum. Of the remaining species, E. cecorum, E. columbae, E. faecalis and E. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas E. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with Tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and six reference antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was assessed against 234 gram-positive bacterial isolates by agar dilution (10(4) CFU/spot). Sparfloxacin activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and five other antibiotics. Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 0.125-0.25 mg/l). Sparfloxacin was also the most active drug tested against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 mg/l) and showed equal activity against gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-resistant (MIC greater than 2,000 mg/l) enterococci. Sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes (MIC90, 1 mg/l). Most Corynebacterium jeikeium showed exquisite susceptibility to sparfloxacin (MIC, 0.06-0.25 mg/l). For MRSA, time-kill curves showed sparfloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal at the MIC of the organism. Sparfloxacin showed greater and more sustained bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin at 1x and 2x the MIC. Reduction in the activity of sparfloxacin occurred with decreased agar pH (from 7.0 to 6.0) and increased bacterial inoculum. Sparfloxacin showed superior activity compared to reference drugs against most gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Fever, somnolence, vomiting, diarrhea].
AB  - A 69-year-old female was admitted because of a febrile state, somnolence, nausea  and diarrhea. Addison's disease known to have developed several years earlier after adrenal tuberculosis suggested Addisonian crisis triggered by an acute infection. Therapy with steroids and substitution of electrolytes and fluid led to rapid improvement. Streptococcus bovis was identified as causative agent. The known association of this germ with cancer of the colon led to further investigation which revealed cancer of the sigmoid and incidental cancer of a salpinx. After surgical removal of both cancers, the patient has remained free of complaints under substitution of steroids.
TI  - Histamine formation by enterococci in goat cheese.
AB  - Cheeses were made of heat-treated goat milk inoculated with large numbers of a histamine-producing strain of Streptococcus faecium or a non-histamine-producing strain of S. faecalis. Every second week during ripening (91 days) the cheeses were sampled for histamine analyses and bacteriological analyses. The numbers of enterococci remained high throughout the whole period of investigation and the maximum amount of histamine detected was 8.2 micrograms/g in one of the cheeses. The enterococci seem to have no relevance from a histamine intoxication point of view in cheeses of this kind.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer, LY264826 had lower MICs for 90% of isolates (MIC90) than vancomycin for all species tested. It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis and otitis media with effusion. How to treat.
AB  - Although microorganisms are cultured in only one out of 3 middle ear effusions, viable and non-viable bacteria are presumed to be responsible in part for otitis media with effusion (OME). Because of this association, antibiotics in sublethal, bacteriostatic, or bacteriocidal concentrations are frequently used as non-surgical therapy for OME. Antibiotic treatment is predicated on the assumption that microorganisms responsible for OME are the same ones which produce acute otitis media. This may not always be the case. Enterococcus faecalis (formerly known as beta-hemolytic group D Streptococcus) was isolated in pure culture from 3 middle ears of two patients with OME. The significance of the isolation of this bacteria, an enteric organism which is infrequently found in upper respiratory tracts, is its lack of susceptibility to the usually prescribed oral antibiotics. In each of the children, failure to respond to antibiotics led to tympanocentesis and culture followed by middle ear drainage with insertion of middle ear ventilating tubes. Unless intravenous antibiotics are used, surgical drainage should be the procedure of choice when E. faecalis is found in the middle ear.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - In-vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 651 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. Three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were also studied. The MICs for 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.06 and 1 mg/l; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC90 was 2 mg/l. Sparfloxacin was 16-fold more active against Acinetobacter spp. than ciprofloxacin. For Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus, spp. and Enterococcus faecalis the MIC90 was between 0.25 and 1 mg/l; sparfloxacin was four-fold more active against Str. pneumoniae than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.03 mg/l; for Bacteroides fragilis the MIC90 was 1 mg/l. The three strains of Chl. trachomatis were susceptible to 0.06-0.12 mg/l sparfloxacin, which was 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross resistance among the quinolones, but not between the quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. The protein binding of sparfloxacin was 40% and serum had little effect on its activity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - Comparative kinetics of hematoporphyrin derivative uptake and susceptibility of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis to photodynamic action.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) is widely used in photoradiation therapy of tumors and other diseases, and has been shown to affect the viability of gram positive bacteria. This investigation assessed the efficiency of binding of HpD to Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis when HpD-treated organisms were exposed to red light. Kinetic studies indicated that the amount of HpD bound increased with increasing external concentration of HpD until saturation of binding sites was reached. S. faecalis had a higher affinity for HpD and was more susceptible to photoinactivation than B. subtilis. The data from this study suggest that differences in susceptibility of microorganisms to photoinactivation are directly related to the affinity of each strain for HpD.
TI  - Some features of the Streptococcus faecalis Na(+)-ATPase resemble those of the vacuolar-type ATPases.
AB  - In the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extract prepared from the membranes of Streptococcus faecalis, we found the 330-kDa protein that was coordinately increased with the induction of Na(+)-ATPase. It was missed in the EDTA extract of Nak1, a mutant defective in the Na(+)-ATPase, but restored in that of its revertant, Nak1R. The 330-kDa protein showed the ATP hydrolytic activity by active staining, and mainly consisted of the polypeptides of 73 kDa, 52 kDa and possibly 38 kDa. In addition, the Na(+)-stimulated ATPase of the membranes was sensitive to both nitrate and N-ethylmaleimide, inhibitors for the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Thus, the Na(+)-ATPase of this organism has a structure similar to vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.
TI  - Release of the component of Streptococcus faecalis Na(+)-ATPase from the membranes.
AB  - The Na(+)-stimulated ATPase activity of Streptococcus faecalis was lost by washing the membranes with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). ATPase activities of both the EDTA extract and the stripped membranes did not show any stimulation by Na+ ions. However, the Na(+)-stimulated ATPase was readily reconstituted by an incubation of these fractions combined. It was only reconstituted from the fractions prepared under the condition that the Na(+)-ATPase is amplified, and not from those boiled or digested by trypsin. Thus, the component of Na(+)-ATPase of this organism is capable of being released from the membranes.
TI  - Growth inhibition of selected food-borne bacteria, particularly Listeria monocytogenes, by plant extracts.
AB  - Six extracts from Chinese medicinal plants: Tin Men Chu, Sey Lau Pai, Siu Mao Heung, Bak Tao Yung, Kam Chin Chiu and Liao Ya, were tested for their inhibitory effect on selected food-borne bacteria by the well assay technique. Among them, Tin Men Chu, Siu Mao Heung and Sey Lau Pai inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi, Salm. enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, and three strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Two of these three extracts, Tin Men Chu and Siu Mao Heung, suppressed the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A in cabbage juice. This inhibition was prevented by the addition of protein but not sodium chloride. Plant extracts show potential to control the growth of food-borne bacteria.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pWBG637 from Staphylococcus aureus to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmids pWBG636 (GmR) and pWBG642 (EmR) derived from the conjugative plasmid pWBG637 were tested for ability to transfer conjugatively to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Both plasmids transferred to S. epidermidis and Strept. faecalis but not to B. subtilis and E. coli. Once in S. epidermis and Strept. faecalis they were transferred back to S. aureus. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the plasmids were stably maintained in S epidermidis and Strept. faecalis.
TI  - The growth-inhibitory effect of the Enterococcus faecalis bacteriocin encoded by  pAD1 extends to the oral streptococci.
AB  - Many strains of Enterococcus faecalis, a normal inhabitant of the oral cavity, elaborate a plasmid-encoded bacteriocin. The growth-inhibitory effect of this bacteriocin was observed to extend to a variety of pathogenic oral streptococci, including those that play a major role in tooth surface colonization and caries formation. These results suggest that transient colonization by bacteriocin-producing E. faecalis may effect shifts in oral colonization by susceptible organisms and that bacteriocin-producing E. faecalis may be a candidate for application in strain replacement therapy.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Identification of chromosomal antibiotic resistance genes in Streptococcus anginosus ("S. milleri").
AB  - Determinants encoding resistance to antibiotics, except penicillin, of 5 of 21 Streptococcus anginosus clinical isolates that we examined transferred by conjugation into Enterococcus faecalis and into 1 to 5 streptococcal recipients at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. No R plasmids were detected in any wild-type strain. DNA homology was detected between chromosomal fragments and the following genes: aadE in 7 strains that were highly resistant to streptomycin, aph-3 in 8 strains that were highly resistant to kanamycin, ermB in 11 of 15 strains that were resistant to erythromycin, and tetM in 14 and tetO in 3 of the 18 strains that were resistant to tetracycline-minocycline. A Tn916-like structure was found in 10 of the 14 strains that carried the tetM gene.
TI  - Identification of lactococci and enterococci by colony hybridization with 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Specific sequences of 23S rRNA of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccus faecium, and Enterococcus malodoratus/Enterococcus avium were identified, and complementary oligonucleotide probes were synthesized. The specificity of the probes was evaluated by dot blot and colony hybridizations. The probes can be used for the specific detection and identification of colonies of the corresponding species in mixed cultures.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY v 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY v 3522 was compared with the activities of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. MICs (in micrograms/ml) of BAY v 3522 were as follows: Staphylococcus spp. (except for oxacillin-resistant strains), 0.13 to 1; Streptococcus spp. (except for some viridans group streptococci), less than or equal to 0.015 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 to 8; other enterococci, 0.5 to greater than 32; beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, 0.13 to 1; beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, 0.5 to 4; Pasteurella multocida, 0.06 to 0.25; and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 to greater than 32. Among the cephalosporins, BAY v 3522 was the most active against gram-positive cocci and cefixime was the most active against gram-negative bacilli; BAY v 3522 was similar in activity to amoxicillin-clavulanate against most species.
TI  - In vitro activity of dirithromycin (LY 237216) compared with activities of other  macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Dirithromycin inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other hemolytic streptococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml, with 90% inhibition at 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is comparable to results using erythromycin. Group A streptococci, listeriae, and enterococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to dirithromycin. Erythromycin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but for erythromycin-resistant isolates MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. For Haemophilus influenzae, MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold greater than for erythromycin. The activity of dirithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci was not decreased by the addition of human serum.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Streptococcus saccharolyticus based on 16S rRNA sequencing.
AB  - Reverse transcriptase sequencing of 16S rRNA of Streptococcus saccharolyticus was performed in order to determine the phylogenetic position of this organism. On the basis of the sequence data Streptococcus saccharolyticus formed a distinct group with Enterococcus faecalis (type species of the genus Enterococcus) and other enterococcal species. Streptococcus saccharolyticus was found to be only distantly related to members of the genus Streptococcus sensu stricto. It is therefore proposed that Streptococcus saccharolyticus be reclassified in the genus Enterococcus, as Enterococcus saccharolyticus comb. nov.
TI  - Disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
AB  - The effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with EDTA and sodium hypochlorite. The specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using Brown & Brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. E. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; S. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; E. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. P. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. E. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. Endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. Camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than Calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. The presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of a deuteroporphyrin-hemin mixture on gram-positive bacteria. A microbiological and spectroscopic study.
AB  - The combined antibacterial activity of various porphyrins with hemin on Gram-positive bacteria was studied. Protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin derivative and deuteroporphyrin show only a marginal inhibitory effect in the dark. However, hemin has a strong cytotoxic effect which is independent of illumination and is equally strong in the dark. The disadvantage of hemin treatment is that it is temporary. In this study, we have demonstrated that a combination of deuteroporphyrin and hemin has a unique cytotoxic activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. The effect of the combined compound is stronger than that of the separate constituents, and is as strong in the dark as in the light. Only 0.005% of the initial S. aureus population survive after a 2 h treatment. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of hemin-deuteroporphyrin mixtures in water and liposomes suggest the formation of a species with spectroscopic properties which are different from those of the two constituents.
TI  - [The detection of streptococcal cell-wall proteins that form complexes with human macroglobulins].
AB  - The composition of the extracts of the cultures of individual streptococcal strains, studied by immunoblotting techniques, has been shown to contain proteins with a molecular weight of 70-80 KD. These proteins have pronounced affinity to human macroglobulins: alpha-macroglobulin, alpha-glycoprotein associated with pregnancy and protein A. The significance of this phenomenon on the cellular and somatic levels is discussed.
TI  - Amino acid sequence of pheromone-inducible surface protein in Enterococcus faecalis, that is encoded on the conjugative plasmid pPD1.
AB  - The major pheromone-inducible protein, PD78, believed to contribute to bacterial  conjugation, was purified from Enterococcus (formerly Streptococcus) faecalis cells containing the plasmid pPD1. A cloned EcoRI-BglII 3.6-kbp fragment of the plasmid pAM351(pPdl::Tn916) contained an open reading frame corresponding to 467 amino acid residues representing PD78. In a central region of the deduced protein, there is a repeated sequence of X-X-Pro that is repeated 15 times. This is analogous to the Gln-Gln-Pro repeat in the C-terminal region of TraD product encoded on the R100 plasmid in Escherichia coli.
TI  - The structure of NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis at 3.3 A resolution.
AB  - NADH peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.1) previously isolated from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 has been crystallized. The crystal structure has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and solvent-flattening at 3.3 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) resolution. The enzyme forms a tetramer consisting of 4 crystallographically related subunits. The monomer chain fold is in general similar to those of glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase. FAD binds in the same region and in a similar conformation as in glutathione reductase. The unusual cysteine-sulfenic acid participating in catalysis is located at the isoalloxazine of FAD.
TI  - Amino acid sequence of pheromone-inducible surface protein in Enterococcus faecalis, that is encoded on the conjugative plasmid pPD1.
AB  - The major pheromone-inducible protein, PD78, believed to contribute to bacterial  conjugation, was purified from Enterococcus (formerly Streptococcus) faecalis cells containing the plasmid pPD1. A cloned EcoRI-BglII 3.6-kbp fragment of the plasmid pAM351 (pPD1::Tn916) contained an open reading frame corresponding to 467 amino acid residues representing PD78. In a central region of the deduced protein, there is a repeated sequence of X-X-Pro that is repeated 15 times. This is analogous to the Gln-Gln-Pro repeat in the C-terminal region of TraD product encoded on the R100 plasmid in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial effectiveness of regular and fresh scent Clorox.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of two different compositions of sodium hypochlorite were compared in a tube dilution study. Absorbent paper points were contaminated with Streptococcus faecalis or Candida albicans and exposed to 5.25% or 2.62% concentrations of "regular" or "fresh scent" sodium hypochlorite (Clorox) for periods ranging from 15 to 120 s. The points were then removed from the sodium hypochlorite solution, placed into a growth medium, incubated, and the presence or absence of growth recorded. Results showed that formulary changes involved in the manufacture of the "fresh scent" sodium hypochlorite had no apparent effect on its antimicrobial properties, as both compositions proved equally effective against the test organisms at each concentration evaluated.
TI  - Maintenance of a neutral cytoplasmic pH is not obligatory for growth of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis at an alkaline pH.
AB  - Both Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis grew in an alkaline medium containing 100 microM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Our data suggested that CCCP functioned as a protonophore at a high pH and that the proton-motive force was dissipated almost completely under such conditions. The pH gradient measured with dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione and acetylsalicylic acid was very small in both bacteria at a high pH above 8, and was not affected significantly by the addition of CCCP. Based on these findings, we propose that the maintenance of neutral cytoplasmic pH is not obligatory for the growth of E. coli and S. faecalis in an alkaline medium.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in enterococci in Nottingham.
AB  
TI  - High-level gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus: microbiology, genetic basis, and epidemiology.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-increasing problem in enterococci. These bacteria are remarkable in their ability to acquire and disseminate antibiotic resistance genes by a variety of routes. Since first described in 1979, high-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC, greater than 2,000 micrograms/mL) has spread worldwide and has been responsible for serious infections. Resistance is plasmid-mediated and due to aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. High-level gentamicin resistance indicates that there will be no synergistic bactericidal activity with penicillin-gentamicin combinations. The epidemiology of nosocomial enterococcal infections is remarkably similar to that of nosocomial infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. The most likely way these resistant bacteria are spread among hospital patients is via transient carriage on the hands of hospital personnel. Patient-to-patient and interhospital transmission of strains has been reported recently. However, clonal dissemination is not the cause of the increased frequency of resistant strains, since gentamicin resistance appears in a variety of different conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids in Enterococcus.
TI  - Evidence for the translocation of Enterococcus faecalis across the mouse intestinal tract.
AB  - The pathogenesis of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis was studied in mice with E. faecalis intestinal overgrowth (10(9) - 10(10) per gram of cecum) induced by metronidazol and streptomycin treatment coupled with oral inoculation of E. faecalis. E. faecalis was recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; mortality was noted in 8 (13%) of 62 mice after 14 days of E. faecalis intestinal overgrowth. Light, immunofluorescent, and electron (scanning and transmission) microscopy of ileal tissue was used in an attempt to localize E. faecalis translocating across intestinal tissue. Dense coccal bacteria were observed in the intestinal lumen, and the epithelium appeared intact. Coccal bacteria were observed adherent to the microvillus border of the entire villous epithelium, including the deeper regions of the intestinal crypts. Immunofluorescence localized E. faecalis within columnar epithelial cells, lamina propria, submucosa, and muscularis externa (including the lumen of small vessels). Transmission electron microscopy localized coccal bacteria within vacuoles in the cytoplasm of intact epithelial cells. These results indicated that E. faecalis could translocate across an intact intestinal tract and cause systemic infection and death. In this model, the intestinal epithelial cell appeared to be a portal of entry in the pathogenesis of systemic E. faecalis infection.
TI  - Transferable plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance in Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - A strain of Listeria monocytogenes, isolated from a patient with meningoencephalitis, was resistant to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics were carried by a 37-kb plasmid, pIP811, that was self-transferable to other L monocytogenes cells, to enterococci-streptococci, and to Staphylococcus aureus. The efficacy of transfer and the stability of pIP811 were higher in enterococci-streptococci than in the other gram-positive bacteria. As indicated by nucleic acid hybridisation, the genes in pIP811 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and streptomycin were closely related to plasmid-borne determinants that are common in enterococci-streptococci. Plasmid pIP811 shared extensive sequence homology with pAM beta 1, the prototype broad host range resistance plasmid in these two groups of gram-positive cocci. These results suggest that emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in Listeria spp is due to acquisition of a replicon originating in enterococci-streptococci. The dissemination of resistance to other strains of L monocytogenes is likely.
TI  - Heterogeneity among the flavin-containing NADH peroxidases of group D streptococci. Analysis of the enzyme from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790.
AB  - Polyclonal antisera prepared against the purified NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 (Enterococcus hirae) do not cross-react with the ATCC 11700 enzyme. Comparative tryptic maps of the two proteins indicate that the differences in primary structures extend beyond those localized to respective antigenic epitopes. Alignments of the NH2-terminal and active-site cysteinyl peptide sequences of the two streptococcal peroxidases reveal identities of 50 and 67% in the respective overlap regions. Dithionite titrations of the ATCC 9790 enzyme reveal a separation in potentials (E2 - E1) for the nonflavin and flavin redox centers of 39 mV, a value nearly 50 mV lower than that observed with the ATCC 11700 peroxidase. Despite these changes in redox behavior NADH titrations of the ATCC 9790 enzyme give rise to both EH2 and EH2.NADH species as previously observed. The enzyme turnover number with hydrogen peroxide is approximately 60% that of the ATCC 11700 peroxidase; the ATCC 9790 peroxidase is also inhibited during turnover with ethyl hydroperoxide. These findings suggest that the flavoprotein NADH peroxidases may exhibit greater diversity among the group D streptococci than previously observed with the widely distributed enzymes of the related flavoprotein disulfide reductase class.
TI  - Comparison of vancomycin-inducible proteins from four strains of Enterococci.
AB  - Vancomycin-inducible proteins of 39.5 and 39 kDa from respectively, low-level and high-level resistant Enterococci were compared. Electrophoretic, immunoblot and peptide analysis revealed three types of protein, one in a low-level resistant strain of E. faecium, one in 2 high-level-resistant strains of E. faecium, and one in a high-level resistant strain of E. faecalis. The inducible proteins of E. faecium and E. faecalis, of 39.5 and 39 kDa respectively, which may function in a similar fashion (Al-Obeid et al. (1990) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34, 252-256), are not related immunologically.
TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis with cefotiam in transurethral resection of the prostate].
AB  - Over a period of 7 months, 50 patients underwent a trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP), this intervention is classified as "clear-contamined". The antibiotic prophylactic protocol, the subject of this study, was the following: cefotiam 2 g IV with the induction of anesthesia, 1 g 3 hours later and 1 g IV with the removal of the urethral catheter. RESULTS: there were 3 early post-operative urinary tract infections, one of these patients was symptomatic, at the time of removal of the urethral catheter. Most of these infections were due to Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. There was 4 late post-operative symptomatic urinary tract infections at days 15, 20, 50, and 120 respectively. All these late infections were due to Streptococcus faecalis. In total, there was a 10% rate of urinary tract infections in the critical 30 days period following the TURP. All the blood cultures were negative. These results lead us to conclude that the short term preventive treatment using the cefotiam, cephalosporin which has a strong prostatic tissue penetration, reduces the rate of post TURP urinary tract infections.
TI  - High-level chromosomal gentamicin resistance in Streptococcus agalactiae (group B).
AB  - This is the first report of high-level gentamicin resistance in a group B streptococcus. Strain B128 of serotype II was isolated from an infected leg wound in 1987. B128 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin as well as of all other available aminoglycosides and was also resistant to tetracyclines. No bactericidal synergism was found between ampicillin or vancomycin and any of these aminoglycosides. Gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance determinants transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free group B streptococcus recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor cell. No transconjugants were detected when streptococci of groups A, C, and G, Streptococcus sanguis, or Enterococcus faecalis was used as a recipient. No plasmids were detected in B128 or in any of the four transconjugants tested. By DNA-DNA hybridization, homology was detected between gene aac6/aph2, of E. faecalis origin, and a 2.4-kilobase HindIII chromosomal fragment of B128; homology to the genes aph3 and aadE, of E. faecalis origin, was found with HindIII chromosomal fragments of the same size (3.0 kilobases). Strains like B128, which potentially can be responsible for severe neonatal infections, are of great clinical concern, since there are to date no antibiotic combinations exhibiting bactericidal synergism against them.

TI  - Technologically important characteristics of Enterococcus isolates from milk and  dairy products.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium (54 strains), E. faecalis (40 strains), and E. durans (14) were isolated from various dairy products (raw milk, cream, butter and fermented milk products) during a previous study (Wessels et al., 1988). In this article various characteristics of these isolates, which may have a bearing on their significance in dairy products, have been studied. A large percentage of the identified strains of all three species were able to grow at 7 degrees C. Seventy-six percent of the E. faecium strains, 62% E. faecalis and 50% E. durans strains also showed proteolytic activity at psychrotrophic temperatures. The fact that proteolytic activity could be detected within 2 days at 7 degrees C is significant, since bulk cooled milk is normally held for 3 to 4 days at temperatures between 4 and 7 degrees C at farms or factories prior to processing. This examination confirmed that enterococci are proteolytic rather than lipolytic.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations and disk diffusion zone diameter for selected antibiotics against streptococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility to 11 antibiotics was determined of 358 streptococcal isolates representing six species was determined. All isolates were from milk samples obtained from clinical or subclinical cases of bovine mastitis. Agar disk diffusion zone diameters and minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for all isolates. Of the antibiotics tested that are available for mastitis therapy, cephalothin, penicillin, ampicillin, novobiocin, and erythromycin demonstrated acceptable activity against nonenterococcal streptococci, but only penicillin and ampicillin demonstrated moderate activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated substantial resistance to cephalothin, erythromycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, while the nonenterococcal streptococci demonstrated substantial resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. Streptococcus uberis demonstrated greater antibiotic resistance than did Streptococcus dysgalactiae, while Aerococcus viridans demonstrated the greatest overall resistance of the nonenterococcal species.
TI  - Cloning and heterospecific expression of the resistance determinant vanA encoding high-level resistance to glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Fragments of plasmid pIP816, which confers high-level glycopeptide resistance in  Enterococcus faecium BM4147, were cloned into a conjugative gram-negative-gram-positive shuttle vector. The resulting hybrids were transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus thuringiensis. A 4-kilobase EcoRI fragment from pIP816 was found to confer vancomycin resistance in these hosts but not in E. coli or Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Conjugative plasmid transfer from Escherichia coli to Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The conjugation mechanism of IncP plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from Escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. This strategy has been adapted for use with the Gram-positive anaerobe, Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052. Several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pAM beta 1 (Enterococcus faecalis), pCB101 (Clostridium butyricum) or pWV01 (Streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting oriT region of RK2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this organism. One of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of IS1. Conjugative mobilization of plasmids from E. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with Candida albicans.
AB  - Thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with Candida albicans. Streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees C-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees C (or at 28 degrees C) increased their coaggregating activity with these streptococci by at least tenfold. This was a property common to four C. albicans strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and MEN) and two of which were not (MM2002 and CA2). The expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin B. The strains of S. sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved C. albicans cells. There was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. Strains of Streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with C. albicans, and the coaggregation with S. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. The coaggregation reactions of S. sanguis and S. gordonii with C. albicans were inhibited by EDTA and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition of lactose or other simple sugars. These observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of C. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.
TI  - The activity in vitro of trospectomycin sulphate (U-63366F) against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Trospectomycin (U-63366F), a 6'-propyl analogue of spectinomycin, was tested against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. The MIC90 for Enterococcus faecalis was 4 mg/l and that for E. faecium was 8 mg/l. Trospectomycin alone was not bactericidal for enterococci, with MBC90 4096 mg/l for both E. faecalis and E. faecium. The addition of commercially available polyvalent immunoglobulin decreased significantly both the MICs and the MBCs and the rendered trospectomycin bactericidal for enterococci. Chequerboard titration of a combination of trospectomycin with ampicillin revealed an FIC index of 1.0 for all the isolates tested. Time-kill curves also did not show any enhancement of bactericidal activity of ampicillin when combined with trospectomycin. A combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was synergistic for enterococci under similar experimental conditions. Trospectomycin can be used as a safe alternative to aminoglycosides or beta-lactam antibiotics in enterococcal infection where bactericidal activity is not required, or in the event of serious side effects from these two classes of antibiotics.
TI  - Genetic functions and cell-cell interactions in the pheromone-inducible plasmid transfer system of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Pheromone-inducible plasmid transfer is a novel form of bacterial conjugation which has, to date, been observed only in Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis. This process includes several important stages of interaction between the donor and recipient cell. The initial interaction is the transmission of a chemical signal from the recipient to the donor cell. Recent evidence has shown that the signal is in the form of a small hydrophobic peptide, which is capable of inducing a complex mating response in the donor cell at concentrations as low as 1-5 molecules per responder cell. Most E. faecalis strains produce multiple pheromones, each of which induces a response only in cells carrying a particular plasmid (or member of a family of related plasmids). Genetic functions ascribed to the pheromone response include: (i) cell-cell aggregation, which promotes initial close contact between mating cells; (ii) surface exclusion, which prevents plasmid transfer between aggregated donor cells; and (iii) highly efficient DNA transfer, which requires other unidentified functions in addition to aggregation. The first two processes appear to be mediated by proteinaceous surface antigens.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - Immobilization and treatment of Streptococcus faecalis for the continuous conversion of arginine into citrulline.
AB  - Citrulline is one of the steps of the arginine dihydrolase system of Streptococcus faecalis. We have shown that the bacteria, immobilized in polyacrylamide gel and treated with Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) or heat, were able to convert arginine to citrulline. Used continuously in a column reactor, the entrapped cells have a stable enzymatic activity for at least 30 days at 45 degrees C.
TI  - [Immunological analysis of Streptococcus sanguis antigens].
AB  - The exact cause of Behcet's disease is still unknown. Recently, advanced bacterial studies revealed that Behcet's disease was related to Streptococcus (S.) sanguis. However, the antigenicity of S. sanguis has not been fully studied. In this study, we clarified the antigenicity of S. sanguis. We made S. sanguis antigens: Mechanical Braun Extract (MBE) and Crude Cell Wall (CCW) from the whole cells, Membrane Fraction (MF) and Cytoplasmic Fraction (CF) from MBE, Cell Wall Fragment (CWF) and Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from MBE. We found that the major antigenicity of S. sanguis was present in CF by use of the Ouchterlony method and the ELISA method. However, apart from S. pyogenes, we could not recognize a common antigenicity among S. sanguis and several other antigens, such as S-Ag, IRBP, retinal soluble fraction, retinal insoluble fraction and Enterococcus faecalis, by the Ouchterlony method. Since we have clarified the antigenicity of S. sanguis in this study, we can now perform detailed examinations with samples from patients with Behcet's disease for S. sanguis antigens.
TI  - The survival of streptococci and enterococci in animal feed and on straw with particular reference to Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The survival of Streptococcus uberis, Strep. bovis, Enterococcus faecalis spp. faecalis and Ent. faecium in animal feed and on wheat straw was studied for one month. Streptococcus bovis survived the best in feed and Strep. uberis the worst while on straw Ent. faecium was the most resilient species and there was little to choose between the other three. The recovery of all species, excepting Strep. bovis, on selective and non-selective agar was comparable. The growth of Strep. bovis, on the other hand, was inhibited on both Edward's medium and inulin agar.
TI  - Stimulation of the respiratory burst in peripheral blood monocytes by lipoteichoic acid. The involvement of calcium ions and phospholipase A2.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Streptococcus faecalis stimulates the respiratory burst in peripheral blood monocytes (mon), as measured by cytochrome C reduction. The effect of LTA was time and dose dependent. LTA stimulated the respiratory burst in a biphasic manner within a range of 1 to 1000 ng/ml.10(6) mon, with maximal activity at 50 ng/ml. At this concentration LTA increased the activity from 0.97 +/- 0.2 to 4.88 +/- 0.2 nmol.10(6) mon/20 min. The role of calcium ions in the effect of LTA in stimulating respiratory burst was studied by changing the availability of calcium ions in the medium, and by measuring the effect of LTA on 45Ca2+ uptake and on intracellular Ca2+ levels. Removal of extracellular calcium ions in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA, abolished the LTA-stimulated respiratory burst. LTA (50 ng/ml) was found to increase 45Ca2+ uptake into monocytes within seconds (from 2200 +/- 242 in the untreated cells to 4642 +/- 365 cpm/min in the LTA-treated mon). At this concentration, LTA stimulated an immediate rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration to 155 +/- 15 nM as compared with 120 +/- 14 nM in the unstimulated monocytes. LTA caused a specific release of arachidonic acid indicating the involvement of phospholipase A2 in the transduction signal stimulating the respiratory burst by LTA.
TI  - Mutants of Streptococcus faecalis sensitive to alkaline pH lack Na(+)-ATPase.
AB  - Alkali-sensitive mutants which grow at pH 7.5 but not at pH 9.5 in Na(+)-rich media were isolated from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790. One of the mutants, designated Nak1, lacked activities of both Na(+)-stimulated ATPase and KtrII (active K+ uptake by sodium ATPase). These activities were restored in a spontaneous revertant designated Nak1R. Active sodium extrusion from Nak1 was observed at pH 7.0, which allows the cells to generate a proton potential, but not at pH 9.5, which reverses the proton potential, making it positive. Sodium extrusion at pH 7.0 was inhibited by addition of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and protonophores. Even at pH 9.5, Nak1 did grow well in Na(+)-poor media. In Na(+)-rich media at pH 7.5, growth of Nak1 but not that of 9790 was severely inhibited by a protonophore. These results indicate that mutant Nak1 lacks sodium ATPase but contains a sodium/proton antiporter and that sodium ATPase is essential for the growth of this organism at high pH in Na(+)-rich conditions.
TI  - Recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - We treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. Four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. All recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. At the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. The bacterial species isolated were S. epidermidis, group D streptococcus, P. acnes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. All patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. Factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. A single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. Patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.
TI  - Enterococcal sepsis and lung microvascular injury in sheep.
AB  - In a common bile duct contamination model, we studied the effect of Streptococcus faecalis compared with Escherichia coli in sheep with chronic lymph fistulas to investigate the role of enterococcus in acute lung injury and acute sepsis. Early pulmonary hypertension in the E coli group was not expressed in the S faecalis group, probably due to a failure of S faecalis to illicit a thromboxane A2 response. In the late period, E coli was associated with significantly greater lung microvascular damage compared with S faecalis. The lack of difference between groups with respect to complement activation suggests the action of chemotactic factors, in addition to complement, mediating granulocyte aggregation, and neutropenia. In this model, S faecalis demonstrated limited pathogenicity as expressed in lung microvascular injury compared with E coli.
TI  - Abnormal maxillary sinus radiographs in children: do they represent bacterial infection?
AB  - Thirty-three children with chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoid enlargement and without previous diagnosis of sinusitis were studied regarding the bacterial flora of their maxillary sinuses. Puncture of maxillary sinus was performed at surgery (adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy) and aspirates were cultured. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 8 of 12 (66.7%) patients whose x-rays showed completely opacified maxillary sinus. Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from 6 (28.6%) of the 21 patients with normal maxillary sinus radiographs. Bacterial titers were greater than 10(4) colonies/mL in all but one of the positive cultures. No anaerobic bacteria were isolated. History of bronchial asthma, presence of nasal purulent secretion, elevated blood eosinophils, and elevated serum IgE were found more frequently in children with complete opacification of maxillary sinus. Serum levels of IgG2 were low in 29% of the children, but no correlation was found between low IgG2 levels and positive cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. We concluded that children with complete radiologic opacification of maxillary sinus had bacterial infection in almost 70% of the cases with symptoms that did not prompt their physicians to consider the diagnosis of sinusitis.
TI  - Treatment of bone and soft tissue infections with teicoplanin.
AB  - The use of teicoplanin was evaluated in a group of 33 patients, which included 18 prosthetic infections, seven with osteomyelitis, five skin and soft tissue infections, and three cases of septic arthritis. The bacterial pathogens isolated were 27 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive 18; methicillin resistant 9), Staph. hominis (2), Staph. epidermidis (1), Staph. haemolyticus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Peptococcus spp. (1). Eleven patients had polymicrobial infections (Gram-positive plus Gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria). In ten cases (nine polymicrobial infections) teicoplanin was used in combination with other antibiotics. Teicoplanin was administered intravenously 400 mg every 24 h in 26 cases, 200 mg every 24 h in six cases and 600 mg every 24 h in one case. The duration of the treatment ranged from 9 to 73 days with a mean of 27.3. Efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients, because in three patients treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions. Cure or improvement was noted in 28 patients (93%). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (83.3%).
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome (HR810) against Enterococcus species.
AB  
TI  - Physical characterisation of the replication region of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1.
AB  - The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of a 5.1-kb EcoRI DNA restriction fragment  carrying the replication region of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 has been determined. Of the seven major open reading frames (ORF A-G) identified within this fragment, two (C and E) were shown to be encoding by in vitro transcription/translation assays. Evidence was obtained that synthesis of the polypeptide (Mr 57,380) encoded by the largest ORF (E) was essential for replication. Deletion analysis indicated that the minimum unit of DNA required for replication resided on a 2.59-kb AccI-HpaI subfragment. ORF C resided outside of this fragment and encompassed an extensive region of directly repeated nt sequence. The encoded polypeptide (Mr 30,471) was therefore composed of large tracts of reiterated amino acid sequence (11 x VDP and 35 x TEP tripeptides) which probably caused the observed anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the synthesised protein (equivalent to 61 kDa). Deletion of a 416-bp segment of DNA between unique KpnI and StyI sites caused an increase in copy number, which correlated with the in vitro production of higher levels of ORF E polypeptide. Although homology was detected between the sequenced DNA, and the replicon of a closely related streptococcal plasmid (pSM19035), none was evident to any other characterised Gram+ plasmid.
TI  - Recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from children.
AB  - A cross-sectional survey of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (VRGPC) in the feces of children was initiated after several bacteremic infections with these organisms occurred at our hospital. A selective medium consisting of colistin-nalidixic acid agar, 5% sheep blood, vancomycin (5 mg/liter), and amphotericin B (8 mg/liter) was developed to isolate VRGPC. A single stool specimen submitted to the clinical microbiology laboratory from each of 48 patients was inoculated onto the medium. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C with 5% carbon dioxide and examined at 24, 48, and 72 h. Susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution. A total of 14 isolates from 11 of 48 (22%) children were recovered. The density of growth ranged from a single colony to 2+. The VRGPC were identified as Leuconostoc lactis (n = 2), Lactobacillus confusus (n = 4), Enterococcus species (n = 5), and Lactococcus lactis (n = 3). One strain of Lactobacillus confusus was recovered from both the stool and the blood of one of these patients. The MICs of vancomycin were 4 micrograms/ml for one of the isolates, 8 micrograms/ml for four of the isolates, and more than 16 micrograms/ml for the remaining eight isolates. All isolates were susceptible to both penicillin and ampicillin. Only 1 of the 11 children had received prior treatment with vancomycin. We conclude that low concentrations of VRGPC may be common in the gastrointestinal tracts of children.
TI  - Species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. Strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of Facklam and Collins (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative Enterococcus faecalis isolates as Enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. The commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. E. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. Enterococcus faecium (8.6%), Enterococcus avium (0.7%), Enterococcus durans (0.3%), Enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), Enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and Enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. None of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of E. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.
TI  - Amplification of the Na+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis at alkaline pH.
AB  - The Na+-ATPase activity of Streptococcus faecalis was influenced by the medium pH. Activities of the protonophore-resistant Na+ extrusion and the KtrII (active K+ uptake by the Na+-ATPase) were maximal in the cells grown at pH 9.5, and were minimal in those grown at pH 6.0. In the cells grown at pH 7.5, they were moderately observed. The Na+-stimulated ATPase activity of the cells grown at pH 9.5 was about 4-fold higher than that of the cells grown at pH 6.0. Thus, amplification of the Na+-ATPase is remarkable at alkaline pH in this organism, possibly by an increase of the cytoplasmic Na+ level as a signal.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance is encoded on a pheromone response plasmid in Enterococcus  faecium 228.
AB  - In Enterococcus faecium 228, vancomycin resistance is encoded on a 55-kilobase conjugative plasmid, pHKK100. This plasmid was transferred with high frequency into susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis and conferred responses to pheromones produced by E. faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis. pHKK100 is the first plasmid described that mediates both vancomycin resistance and pheromone response.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of WIN 57273, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - WIN 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone that has an expanded spectrum of activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC for 90% of isolates [MIC90], 0.008 microgram/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), Bacillus spp. (MIC90, 0.03 micrograms/ml), Listeria monocytogenes (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and Bacteroides fragilis group strains (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Like other fluoroquinolone compounds, WIN 57273 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (97% of strains inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus, Branhamella, and Neisseria strains (100% susceptible), Acinetobacter spp. (100% susceptible), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (68% susceptible). We observed that WIN 57273 was very active against cephalosporin- or aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative strains but shared cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones. Increasing inoculum concentrations had minimal effects on WIN 57273 MICs, and the drug was considered to be bactericidal based on reference MBC and kill curve analyses. Unlike most previously studied drugs in this class, WIN 57273 had increased activity (three- to fourfold) at low pH. Rates of mutation to WIN 57273 resistance at eight times its MIC were in the range of 5.6 x 10(-8) to greater than 1.4 x 10(-9). This new compound possesses a wide potential spectrum of use, and it should be evaluated further by in vitro and in vivo studies.
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.
AB  - Enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in France, the UK and the USA. All such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. The mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. That the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. Transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis Challis has been reported. The structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal DNA. The plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some DNA sequence homology.
TI  - Mechanisms of resistance of enterococci to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Two mechanisms are responsible for resistance of enterococci to beta-lactam antibiotics: alterations of penicillin-binding proteins and production of a beta-lactamase. The latter has been found in a few clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, whereas the former appears to account for resistance in most strains. A correlation has been established between the amount of a particular penicillin-binding protein which has a low affinity for penicillin and the level of resistance. The higher activity of some penicillins, as compared to cephalosporins, has been related to the relatively higher affinity for these penicillins of the penicillin-binding protein involved in the mechanism of resistance. Alterations in the autolytic enzyme pattern have been associated with the paradoxical response to bactericidal activity of penicillin often exhibited by Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates.
TI  - In-vitro studies with ramoplanin (MDL 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of Actinoplanes sp. (ATCC 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and D-mannose. The in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. Ramoplanin was very active against Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. Concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. Ramoplanin was also very active against Streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, Str. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. (including Cory. jeikeium), Listeria monocytogenes, Gardnerella vaginalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. In general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. With the exception of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Mechanism of resistance to vancomycin in Enterococcus faecium D366 and Enterococcus faecalis A256.
AB  - The role of the glycopeptide-inducible proteins of Enterococcus faecium D366 (39.5 kilodaltons) and Enterococcus faecalis A256 (39 kilodaltons) in the mechanism of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was examined. Crude cell walls from noninduced cells or from induced cells treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove the inducible proteins were shown to bind vancomycin, in contrast to cell walls containing the cytoplasmic membrane-associated induced proteins, which did not bind vancomycin. Cytoplasmic membranes from vancomycin-induced cells did not inactivate (bind) vancomycin or teicoplanin, but they could protect the glycopeptides from being bound to the synthetic pentapeptide. This protection could be competitively abolished by D-alanyl-D-alanine. A decrease in glycopeptide binding to the pentapeptide was observed in a time-dependent fashion after treatment of the pentapeptide with the cytoplasmic membranes from induced cells. We hypothesize that the inducible proteins are responsible for glycopeptide resistance due to the binding to, and subsequent enzymatic modification of, the pentapeptide precursor of peptidoglycan, which is considered to be the natural target of glycopeptides.
TI  - [Studies on delayed skin reactivity to streptococci in Behcet's disease].
AB  - Delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with Behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. In the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to E. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. No significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to S. pyogenes. Prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls, using S. pyogenes, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and E. faecalis as antigens. It was shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. The antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. These results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes in the genus Enterococcus.
AB  - Recent taxonomic changes among the catalase-negative gram-positive cocci have led to the recognition of a separate genus for bacteria previously considered to be members of the genus Streptococcus. Presently, a total of 12 species of the genus Enterococcus have been described. The characteristics, taxonomy and nomenclature of these species, along with the possible clinical implications of revised enterococcal taxonomy, are discussed.
TI  - The enterococci: an enigma and a continuing therapeutic challenge.
AB  
TI  - Serological response in Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis expresses three species-specific surface protein antigens of molecular weights 73,000, 40,000, and 37,000. On Western blotting (immunoblotting), they were detected strongly by immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera from patients with E. faecalis endocarditis, but not in sera from patients with other E. faecalis infections or with endocarditis due to other streptococci. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA levels to these antigens and evaluated its potential as a serodiagnostic test for E. faecalis endocarditis. The test correctly diagnosed E. faecalis endocarditis in 15 of 16 cases. Of 10 cases of endocarditis due to other streptococci and 10 E. faecalis infections other than endocarditis, 9 and 8, respectively, gave negative results. The test should prove particularly useful in culture-negative cases, for which choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy for E. faecalis endocarditis is vital.
TI  - Successful prophylaxis of experimental streptococcal endocarditis with single-dose amoxicillin administered after bacterial challenge.
AB  - Rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were challenged intravenously with  various inoculum sizes of tolerant Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus faecalis. Single-dose amoxicillin (40 mg/kg) was given intravenously either 30 min before or 30-240 min after bacterial challenge. Prophylaxis of endocarditis against both strains was successful when the inocula used for challenge were in the range of the minimum inoculum producing bacterial endocarditis in 90% of control animals (ID90) but was less effective or failed with larger inocula or when amoxicillin administration was delayed up to 240 min after bacterial challenge with S. sanguis. In a group of rats profoundly depleted of neutrophils by a rabbit anti-rat neutrophil serum given 30 min after challenge with S. faecalis at ID90, single-dose amoxicillin administered simultaneously with the antiserum was protective, indicating that neutrophils were not required for successful endocarditis prophylaxis.
TI  - The life and times of the Enterococcus.
AB  - Enterococci are important human pathogens that are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. These organisms were previously considered part of the genus Streptococcus but have recently been reclassified into their own genus, called Enterococcus. To date, 12 species pathogenic for humans have been described, including the most common human isolates, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococci cause between 5 and 15% of cases of endocarditis, which is best treated by the combination of a cell wall-active agent (such as penicillin or vancomycin, neither of which alone is usually bactericidal) and an aminoglycoside to which the organism is not highly resistant; this characteristically results in a synergistic bactericidal effect. High-level resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to the aminoglycoside eliminates the expected bactericidal effect, and such resistance has now been described for all aminoglycosides. Enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections; intraabdominal, pelvic, and wound infections; superinfections (particularly in patients receiving expanded-spectrum cephalosporins); and bacteremias (often together with other organisms). They are now the third most common organism seen in nosocomial infections. For most of these infections, single-drug therapy, most often with penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin, is adequate. Enterococci have a large number of both inherent and acquired resistance traits, including resistance to cephalosporins, clindamycin, tetracycline, and penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as oxacillin, among others. The most recent resistance traits reported are penicillinase resistance (apparently acquired from staphylococci) and vancomycin resistance, both of which can be transferred to other enterococci. It appears likely that we will soon be faced with increasing numbers of enterococci for which there is no adequate therapy.
TI  - [Cefpiramide: antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, and clinical evaluation].
AB  - We determined MIC values of cefpiramide (CPM) against clinical isolates from 100  patients who were subjected to total hysterectomy between April 1986 and March 1988. We also investigated the concentrations of CPM in uterine tissue and assessed the clinical efficacy of postoperative prophylaxis. 1. Against bacteria isolated from clinical materials the MIC80 values of CPM were as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis 1.56 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecalis 25 micrograms/ml, and Escherichia coli 6.25 micrograms/ml. 2. Peak concentrations of CPM in various tissues and tissue/serum ratios of AUC were as follows: cervix uteri 35 micrograms/g (39.5%), perimetrium 43 micrograms/g (44.9%), endometrium 39 micrograms/g (51.6%), myometrium 28 micrograms/g (26.8%), oviduct 67 micrograms/g (41.9%), and ovary 27 micrograms/g (45.8%). In all tissues examined CPM concentrations were above 4 micrograms/g after 600 minutes. 3. Serum half-lives were T 1/2(alpha) = 13.2 minutes and T 1/2(beta) = 260.2 minutes. 4. The efficacy rate in postoperative prophylaxis was 97.9%. 5. No serious side effects were observed.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the pAD1 hemolysin/bacteriocin determinant in Enterococcus faecalis: Tn917 insertional mutagenesis and cloning.
AB  - Thirty-seven nonhemolytic/nonbacteriocinogenic mutations in Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis plasmid pAD1 were generated by Tn917 insertion. All were found to belong to one of two complementation classes. Each class of mutants secreted either hemolysin/bacteriocin (Hly/Bac) component A or L into the culture medium. DNA encoding Hly/Bac was cloned in Escherichia coli in which both components of the hemolysin were expressed individually and collectively. The region encoding components A and L was further defined by deletion analysis and physically mapped. A total of approximately 8.4 kilobases of pAD1 DNA were observed to be required for hemolysin expression. Hly/Bac activity of the wild-type and the inactive L substance was observed to be heat stable. Active Hly/Bac resulting from incubating separately secreted components A and L was also found to be heat stable. The results indicate that component A activates component L and that activated component L possesses the Hly/Bac activity. Component A was also observed to be associated with host immunity to the Hly/Bac.
TI  - Radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. I. Development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. Formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) is the major chemotactic peptide in Escherichia coli culture supernatants. This paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (RIA) for FMLP and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. The assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/L FMLP) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with F-met-leu-tyr, F-nle-leu-phe and F-met-met-met sequences (ID50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/L, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (ID50 = 10(5) nmol/L. Culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography before RIA. All five organisms produced immunoreactive F-met peptides. A major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic FMLP was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in Streptococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis cultures. In E. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive FMLP increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth reaching 31.2 nmol/L(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/mL (n = 6). These findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a RIA for FMLP will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.
TI  - A model for aggregation-dispersion dynamics of a population.
AB  - An important feature that distinguishes the movement of living systems from the random motion of inorganic material is a delicate balance between spreading and concentrating. This movement is based on the kind of interactions which a bacterial colony may establish during migration. Namely, the antagonistic effects of dispersal which take place preferentially down the population gradient and the tendency in grouping together. In this work a model is proposed which considers these effects. The phase plane analysis and the numerical calculations reveal the existence of stable sharp wave front solutions. The speed of the wave front is modulated by the compromise between the tendencies of spreading and aggregating. The results obtained were compared with experimental observations in cultures of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The agreement between both types of results supports the hypothesis on which the model was based.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of Streptococcus faecalis septicemia in children].
AB  - The clinical analysis of 59 cases of Streptococcus faecalis sepsis in infants aged 1 to 5 months has been presented. Streptococcus faecalis strains isolated from the blood were characterized by drug resistance especially against penicillin or its derivatives. The clinical picture of the Streptococcus faecalis sepsis in a majority of cases is similar to that of other Gram-positive sepsis. Meningitis, first of all purulent, was noted in twenty percent of infected children. About one third of neonates with the Streptococcus faecalis sepsis showed intrauterine infection. The mortality index in children with the Streptococcus faecalis sepsis was equal to 10.2%.
TI  - [Fever during labor. A prospective study of 6,305 deliveries].
AB  
TI  - Studies on the synthesis, characterisation and antimicrobial activity of new Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff base derived from ninhydrin and glycine.
AB  - For the first time, Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate Schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-N-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. These coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, NMR and electronic spectral studies. Mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. The experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the Schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. A molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. A comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.
TI  - Growth rate, proteolysis and acid production of Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens in skim milk with some additives.
AB  - Growth rate, proteolysis and acid production of Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens were examined in skim milk with and without 0.15% calcium lactate, 0.03 M Na, K phosphate, 5% CaCO3 or 2-8% NaCl, at 30 degrees C. Calcium lactate affected neither the growth rate nor the breakdown of casein. The highest acid production and degradation of casein occurred in phosphate-buffered skim milk (pH 7.1). Inorganic phosphate did not have any influence on the generation time and hydrolysis of casein. CaCO3, on the contrary, slightly reduced the growth rate and the acid production; proteolysis was markedly decreased. Although 2% NaCl brought about ca. 17% reduction in the number of viable cells, it increased not only the breakdown of casein but the acid production during the exponential phase as well. Higher salt concentrations inhibited growth, acid production and proteolysis. The effect increased with increasing the salt level. An adaptation period of 24 h followed by little growth was observed in milk containing 8% NaCl.
TI  - [A clinical study of asymptomatic bacteriospermia].
AB  - Asymptomatic bacteriospermia was studied as an entity and its treatment was investigated in 65 subjects who clinically needed their semen tested. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. The rate of detection of bacteria in semen was 89.2%, and the rates of detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were 55.4% and 70.8%, respectively. Forty Gram-positive strains were identified among the aerobic bacteria; rates of detection for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were high, and 6 strains (9.2%) of Streptococcus agalactiae were also present. The rate of detection of Gram-negative bacteria was low; only 3 strains were identified. Among the anaerobic bacteria 90 Gram-positive strains were identified; the rate of detection of Peptostreptococcus (58 strains) was high, and only 11 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were present. 2. Among cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, lomefloxacin, latamoxef and flomoxef (FMOX), FMOX was, in general, superior to the other drugs in terms of antibacterial activities against those strains isolated from semen. 3. Bacterial changes were observed in the semen specimens from 11 subjects who were subjected to oral administration of CCL (1,500 mg/days). After the treatment, 25 strains of bacteria disappeared but 7 strains remained among 32 strains that were present before treatment, and 23 strains appeared due to superinfection.
TI  - Mutation rates to 4-quinolone resistance.
AB  - The sensitivity of Staph. aureus, Staph. warneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Strep.  pneumoneae and Strep. faecalis to eleven 4-quinolone antibacterials was compared by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations on nutrient agar. In all cases where the minimum inhibitory concentration was less than 10 micrograms/ml then the frequency at which 4-quinolone-resistant mutants arose was estimated using each drug at 5, 10 and 20 times its minimum inhibitory concentration. It was found with all five bacterial species tested that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most potent antibacterial and that no mutants could be detected in 10(12) bacteria for either drug with Staph. warneri, Strep. pneumoneae and Strep. faecalis. On the other hand, mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both 5 and 10 times (but not 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected at similar frequencies in the 10(12) bacteria tested. With Staph. aureus, mutants resisting 5 times (but not 10 or 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected in the 10(12) bacteria tested at similar frequencies. However, all mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin retained the ability to produce coagulase while the majority of ofloxacin-resistant mutants had lost their ability to produce coagulase. Hence clear evidence for pathogenicity loss was observed with ofloxacin but not with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Interactions between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The effects of various combinations of antibacterial (ampicillin, cephadroxil, doxycycline, imipenem, trimethoprimsulfadiazine) and antineoplastic (cisplatin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone) drugs were evaluated in vitro with regard to antibacterial activity on five clinical isolates from cancer patients of respectively Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. With one exception no significant effects on the bacterial growth were observed in the presence of the antitumor drug alone. In contrast, all five strains of Strept. faecalis grew better when mitoxantrone was included in a concentration of 0.1 mg/l. A synergistic action between imipenem and mitoxantrone was seen for single strains of Staph. aureus and E. coli. Furthermore, a dose-effect related inhibition by cisplatin on the growth of Strept. faecalis in the presence of sub MIC levels of trimethoprimsulfadiazine was observed. The study indicates that interaction between antibacterial and antineoplastic drugs is an erratic phenomenon, which has to be dealt with separately for each combination of drugs as well as for each bacterial strain.
TI  - Adsorption of Streptococcus faecalis on diatomite carriers for use in biotransformations.
AB  - Adsorption of cells on particulate carriers is potentially one of the most cost-effective immobilization techniques available. Diatomite carriers, such as Celite, have desirable physical properties, are inexpensive, and are suitable for both mycelial and bacterial systems. This work investigated the use of diatomite carriers as a biocatalyst support in a packed-bed reactor where L-tyrosine was enzymatically decarboxylated using adsorbed, non-growing cells of Streptococcus faecalis. Composition of microbial adsorption on different Celite types, with mean pore sizes ranging from 0.55 to 22 microns, showed there was no significant difference in biomass loading capacity under the conditions used. Using Celite 560, biomass loadings in a packed-bed reactor varied from 10 to 30 g dm-3 of reactor volume, which compares favourably with other adsorption methods. When used to decarboxylate L-tyrosine, the reactor was found to have a half-life of 15-20 h. A combination of enzyme activity loss and slow leakage of biomass from the packed-bed reactor was responsible for the decline in conversion. Treatment of the S. faecalis cells with glutaraldehyde significantly reduced the enzyme activity loss and extended the reactor half-life to 65 h, but had little effect on the rate of cell leakage from the reactor. Further work on reduction of cell leakage rate seems necessary for evaluation of the system's practicality.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction study of the flavoprotein NADH  peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1.
AB  - NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 has been crystallized from ammonium sulfate solutions using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Depending on pH, the crystals grew in the orthorhombic space group I222 or one of its subgroups P222 or P2(1)2(1)2 (or one of its two permutations). In both cases the unit cell axes are a = 76.6 A, b = 132.9 A, and c = 145.7 A. There are two monomers/asymmetric unit in the body-centered crystal form and four in the primitive one. The enzyme is catalytically active in the crystalline state. The crystals diffract to at least 2.5 A resolution; they are stable in the x-ray beam and hence suitable for detailed three-dimensional structure determination.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in infections of neonates].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated for its absorption and excretion as well as for therapeutic effectiveness in neonates and premature infants. The following results were obtained. 1. Serum concentrations of the drug were examined in 3 premature infants 1 to 11 days old upon intravenous administration of about 10 mg/kg body weight (1st group), in 2 premature infants 18 and 32 days old and 1 neonate 17 days old upon intravenous administration of about 20 mg/kg (2nd group), and in 1 neonate 15 days old with meningitis upon intravenous administration of 45.2 mg/kg. Concentrations of CMX at 30 minutes after administration were 43, 29 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 46, 37 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 208 micrograms/ml in the other neonate, and appeared to be dose-dependent. Concentrations of CMX at 6 hours after administration were 18.2, 6.6 and 8.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 9.6, 11 and 1.35 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 5.2 micrograms/ml in the other subject. Serum half-lives were, respectively, 4.59, 2.85 and 3.48 hours in the 1st group, 2.52, 2.73 and 1.14 hours in the 2nd group and 1.0 hour in the other subject. Urinary recovery rates during the first 6 hours after administration were 45.8, 87.0, 50.2 and more than 100% in 4 cases examined. Two of these cases, in which recovery rates were 45.8 and 50.2%, were premature infants of low birth weight. Spinal fluid concentrations of the drug at 80 to 90 minutes after dosing to 1 neonate with purulent meningitis (causative organism presumed: Escherichia coli) given 48.3 mg/kg tended to decline gradually with the recovery of the disease, 3.8, 1.72 and 1.32 micrograms/ml on the 2nd, 6th and 8th day, respectively. 2. The drug was given to 9 neonates 0 to 24 days old. The therapeutic effectiveness on bacterial infections was evaluated in 7 cases (10 diseases) including 1 disease of purulent meningitis presumably caused by E. coli, 4 of septicemia caused by E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (1, 2 and 1, respectively), 3 of urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, Serratia and Enterococcus faecalis (1 each), 1 of purulent parotitis caused by S. aureus and 1 of pneumonia (causative organism was unknown). Therapeutic efficacies were assessed as "Excellent" in all of meningitis, septicemia and urinary tract infection cases, and "Good" in 1 each of purulent parotitis and pneumonia cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Few-minutes tests for the identification of group A streptococci and enterococci  with chromogenic substrates.
AB  - The usefulness of paper strip tests for rapid identification of Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci cultured on blood agar plates was investigated. The paper strips used contain dried chromogenic substrates for pyrrolidonyl peptidase (PYRase) and beta-glucosidase (beta-Gluc). Material from only a few colonies needed to be applied to the test strips. The reactions could be read after two min (PYRase) and 5-7 min (beta-Gluc), respectively. Results from testing 503 streptococcal strains were evaluated. The reactions proved very useful for rapid differentiation of S. pyogenes and enterococci from human sources. Nearly all strains of these streptococcal species showed positive reactions in the PYRase test whereas only the enterococci (E. faecalis and E. faecium) were positive for both enzymes.
TI  - The survival patterns of selected faecal bacteria in tropical fresh waters.
AB  - The survival of various faecal bacteria used as indicators of the faecal contamination of water supplies has been investigated in a tropical environment (Sierra Leone). Isolates representing the thermotolerant coliform (TtC) and faecal streptococcus (FS) groups, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were studied over a 48 h period of immersion in water from three different sources. Survival patterns varied according to source type, but some general observations were made: a portion of the TtC group was apparently capable of substantial regrowth; FS organisms died off at a faster rate than TtC organisms initially, but survived longer; vegetative cells of C. perfringens died off rapidly; and Salmonella spp. could survive for as long as the other faecal organisms tested. The implications of results for the analysis of tropical waters for faecal contamination are discussed.
TI  - Introduction of transposon Tn916 DNA into Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus  parainfluenzae.
AB  - Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis transposon Tn916 was introduced into Haemophilus influenzae Rd and Haemophilus parainfluenzae by transformation and demonstrated to transpose efficiently. Haemophilus transformants resistant to tetracycline were observed at a frequency of approximately 3 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(3)/micrograms of either pAM120 (pGL101::Tn916) or pAM180 (pAM81::Tn916) plasmid DNAs, which are incapable of autonomous replication in this host. Restriction enzyme analysis and Southern blot hybridization revealed that (i) Tn916 integrates into many different sites in the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae genomes; (ii) only the 16.4-kilobase-pair Tn916 DNA integrates, and no vector DNA was detected; and (iii) the Tetr phenotype was stable in the absence of selective pressure. Second-generation Tn916 transformants occurred at the high frequency of chromosomal markers and retained their original chromosomal locations. Similar results were obtained with H. influenzae Rd BC200 rec-1 as the recipient strain, which suggests host rec functions are not required in Tn916 integrative transposition. Transposition with Tn916 is an important procedure for mutagenesis of Haemophilus species.
TI  - Sodium-translocating adenosine triphosphatase in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Sodium-translocating ATPase in the fermentative bacterium Streptococcus faecalis  exchanges sodium for potassium ions. Sodium ions stimulate its activity, but K+ ions have no significant effect at present. Although the molecular nature of the sodium ATPase is not clear, the enzyme is distinct from other ion-motive ATPases (E1E2 type and F1F0 type) as judged by its resistance to vanadate as well as dicyclohexylcarbodiimde. The sodium ATPase is induced when cells are grown on media rich in sodium, particularly under conditions that limit the generation of a proton potential or block the constitutive sodium proton antiporter, indicating that an increase in the cytoplasmic sodium level serves as the signal. The enzyme is not induced in response to K+ deprivation. The sodium ATPase may have evolved to cope with a sodium-rich environment under conditions that limit the magnitude of the proton potential.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci and epidemiology of enterococcal infection in the 1980s.
AB  
TI  - Influence of technical parameters on the in vitro motility of equine neutrophils  in the presence of streptococcal culture supernatant.
AB  - To identify the influence of technical factors on the in vitro motility of equine neutrophils towards streptococcus culture supernatant in an under-agarose assay, we studied the changes in eight cell migration parameters. The distances the phagocytes travelled by directed, random and spontaneous migration increased with incubation time, cell concentration and the gelatin and serum contents of the migration plates. The contribution of chemotaxis to the phagocyte migrations, however, decreased simultaneously. The directed and random, though not the spontaneous, migrations of the phagocytes increased also when the chemoattractant wells were placed closer to the cell wells but so did the influence of the chemokinetic activity of the bacterial culture supernatant on phagocyte motility. In contrast, preincubation of migration plates with the chemoattractant, the agarose content of the migration plates and contamination of the granulocytes with non-migrating, mononuclear cells did not substantially affect the in vitro migrations of the neutrophils. The changes in the in vitro motility of the equine neutrophils by these technical factors were, in general, comparable to those reported for human cells attracted by a variety of host-and bacteria-derived chemoattractants.
TI  - The streptococcal flavoprotein NADH oxidase. I. Evidence linking NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase cysteinyl redox centers.
AB  - The FAD-containing NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of O2----2H2O, has been purified by an improved procedure for analyses of its structural and redox properties. The enzyme is apparently a dimer of two identical subunits, each containing 1 mol of FAD. Dithionite reduction of the enzyme proceeds in two distinct phases corresponding to approximately 0.5 and 1.1 eq/FAD, respectively. Thiol assays of the NADH oxidase, reduced anaerobically with 1 eq of NADH/FAD prior to denaturation, are consistent with the presence of a single redox-active cysteinyl residue/subunit. Analysis of the cysteinyl peptides of the oxidase, identified in tryptic digests of the enzyme labeled metabolically with [35S]cysteine, reveals a sequence which is closely related to the redox-active cysteinyl peptide sequence recently determined for the streptococcal flavoprotein NADH peroxidase. A second cysteinyl peptide sequence, when aligned with residues 3-17 of the peroxidase NH2-terminal sequence, reveals identity in 7 of 15 positions and satisfies several of the criteria described for ADP-binding structures. Additional probes of the structural and redox properties of the NADH oxidase, including visible circular dichroism spectroscopy and sensitivity to inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, provide further evidence for a fundamental structural connection between flavin-dependent NADH oxidase and peroxidase functions.
TI  - Immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. Swedish Study Group.
AB  - In the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. Sixty-six patients (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. Five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d. for 5-29 days (median nine days). Three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days after the first dose. One third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately severe in 33 of the patients. Fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. The immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Among the aerobic microorganisms isolated Escherichia coli (46 strains) Staphylococcus epidermidis (22 strains), Streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). Thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. E. coli and B. fragilis gave rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against S. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against S. milleri in two cases and against E. faecalis in three cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a new tetracyclic quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a tetracyclic quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum. The in vitro activity of KB-5246 against gram-negative bacteria was higher than that of ofloxacin or norfloxacin and was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated the greatest activity against gram-positive bacteria of the four agents tested. Among Streptococcus pyogenes strains resistant to 1.56 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 26 strains susceptible to 0.2 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Similarly, among the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains resistant to 3.13 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 23 S. aureus and 11 S. epidermidis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Among the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis strains resistant to 12.5 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 5 S. pneumoniae and 10 E. faecalis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. KB-5246 had bactericidal activity at the MIC. KB-5246 demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against various systemic infections in mice. After oral administration, KB-5246 was as active as ofloxacin and about two times more active than norfloxacin.
TI  - Efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against Bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides species. In order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant Bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.) were tested. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the associated culture as a whole. In the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the MBCs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to MBCs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in single strain testing.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the conjugal transfer determinants encoded by the streptococcal broad-host-range plasmid pIP501.
AB  - pIP501 is a 30.2-kilobase (kb) broad-host-range conjugative streptococcal plasmid which encodes chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. A smaller conjugation-proficient derivative of pIP501 has been constructed and designated pVA1702. pVA1702 is 25.2 kb, encodes only kanamycin resistance, and confers conjugative ability in an Enterococcus faecalis mating system. The temperature-sensitive transposon delivery vectors pTV1ts and pTV32 carrying Tn917 and Tn917lac, respectively, were used to create insertion mutants of pVA1702 in E. faecalis. These insertions enabled us to localize the determinants conferring conjugation to two separate regions of pVA1702: the 7.5-kb region A and the 8.8-kb region B. A nested set of deletions of the 7.5-kb region was subcloned in Escherichia coli, and the expression of these deletions was examined in an E. coli minicell system. The genes for three conjugal proteins have been located and designated cnjA, cnjB, and cnjC (for conjugation). Two other peptides that are transcribed in a divergent direction from the cnj genes were encoded in the A region, but it is not known whether they are involved in conjugation. These studies indicate that the conjugation genes of pIP501 are arranged in multiple transcriptional units.
TI  - Serological identification of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Str. thermophilus) has no group-specific antigen. HCl extracts of 551 strains of streptococci isolated from cheese or yogurt (123 Str. thermophilus and 428 Enterococcus faecalis - Ent. faecium spp.) were examined with three type-specific antisera prepared against representatives of Str. thermophilus and also with Lancefield group D antisera. All typical (80) or atypical (43) strains of Str. thermophilus reacted with at least one type-specific antiserum and none of the enterococci reacted. Only two strains reacted with both type-specific and group antisera.
TI  - Diagnosing endocarditis with the cloned 112 kDa antigen of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A new indirect ELISA is presented for the diagnosis of enterococcal endocarditis. It is based on the cloning of Enterococcus faecalis DNA into lambda gt11. The library was screened by antisera from three cases of E. faecalis endocarditis. Three positive clones were found, all of which cross-reacted with the 112 kDa antigen of E. faecalis. One of these was taken and lysogenised into E. coli Y1089 to produce a fusion protein of 125 kDa. This IPTG dependent protein was purified by affinity chromatography and used in an indirect ELISA. The test differentiated between five cases of enterococcal endocarditis (IgG ELISA optical density greater than 0.8) and patients with endocarditis due to staphylococci (IgG ELISA optical density less than 0.243) and other streptococci (IgG ELISA optical density less than 0.656). Patients with a simple E. faecalis septicaemia had a maximum IgG ELISA optical density of 0.636. The only major cross-reaction occurred in patients with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis.
TI  - Purification and characterisation of tyrosine decarboxylase and aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase.
AB  - Microbial tyrosine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.25) and mammalian aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) catalyse the formation of tyramine from L-tyrosine. These enzymes were characterised after isolation to purity by methods including fast polymer liquid chromatography (FPLC). Tyrosine decarboxylase was isolated from Streptococcus faecalis by FPLC anion exchange chromatography (11-times purification; 72% recovery; 23.2 U/mg protein). FPLC on Phenyl-Superose resulted in purification to 115 U/mg protein. Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase was isolated from pig kidney by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE chromatography, and FPLC anion exchange chromatography (21-times purification; 22% recovery; 0.71 U/mg protein). By FPLC chromatofocusing, tyrosine decarboxylase eluted at pH 4.3 and aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase at pH 5.0. Isoelectric focusing of tyrosine decarboxylase gave two bands (pI 4.4 and 4.5). With pyridoxal 5'-phosphate removed by ultrafiltration, only one band (pI 4.4) appeared, and SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis confirmed the purity. FPLC gel filtration resulted in molecular weights 143,000 and 86,000, respectively, for tyrosine decarboxylase and aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. In SDS electrophoresis, tyrosine decarboxylase had the monomer molecular weight 75,000, showing a dimer structure for the enzyme.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). II. Background of patients].
AB  - From July to October in 1986, hospital data on 717 isolates of causative microorganism from patients with urinary tract infections and background information on 562 patients were collected. The urinary tract infections were divided into 3 groups; simple infections and complicated infections with or without the use of indwelling catheter. We investigated such factors as the patients' sex, age, and drug treatments, and the isolates obtained from the infections. From 1981 to 1986, about 25% of the patients with simple infections were males and about 60 to 70% among those with complicated infections were males each year. During these 6 years, no noticeable changes occurred in sex and age distributions of patients with any type of the infections, but the species of isolates changed remarkably. In 1982 and 1983, the isolation rates of Enterococcus faecalis (Streptococcus spp. or Streptococcus faecalis) obtained from the patients were about 8% in both of male and female patients. In 1984, the rate in females increased to 17.9%. In 1985, the rates in males and females were 14.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Similar rates were also observed in 1986: 16.1 and 7.4%. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus in 1982 was 0.7%, as was in 1983. In however, increased to 1.7% in 1984 and to 3.2% in 1985. It was 2.5% in 1986. The isolation rate of Gram-positive bacteria was 11.1% in 1982; it increased to 18.9% in 1983 and to over 20% between 1984 to 1986. Among Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa form patients with complicated urinary tract infections with a catheter was high and over 20% in both 1985 and 1986. When antibacterial agents were administrated for 3 days, changes in number of species of isolates tended to be more pronounced in complicated infections with or without the use of catheter than in simple infections. According to date obtained in 1986, when antibiotic agents were administered for 8 or more days, the changes were definitely more drastic in complicated infections than in simple ones. An upmost care in the selection of antibiotic drugs according to their antibacterial spectra and activities, therefore, appears necessary, and an attention should be paid on future changes in species of bacteria isolated from infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Postantibiotic effects of imipenem, norfloxacin, and amikacin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of imipenem and norfloxacin were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin was tested against the same bacteria except Streptococcus faecalis. For in vitro tests, a viable count-washing method was used, and for in vivo tests, the thread technique in normal mice was used. All three drugs produced PAEs of 1.1 to 3.8 h in vitro and 1.4 to 4.3 h in vivo against the pathogens tested. In vitro and in vivo results correlated well. The PAE had a significantly (P less than 0.01 to 0.001) longer duration in vivo than in vitro, but the PAE of imipenem on Staphylococcus aureus was longer in vitro. The PAE was not due to residual antibiotics at the site of infection, and no PAE was obtained if at any time the antibiotic concentration at the infection site reached the MIC for the pathogen tested. The results indicate that the presence of a PAE may enable antibiotics to be given more intermittently without a loss of efficacy and that the PAE can only be induced if the level of the antibiotic exceeds the MIC for the pathogen in question for at least several minutes.
TI  - [Chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. Murine peritoneal PMN was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. The PMN response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (CL) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the CL response were also measured. The bacteria which could induce a high level of CL response of PMN were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were Staphylococcus subsp. and Actinomyces subsp.; low levels were Lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of Streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis. Phagocytic indexes of PMN to various kind of bacteria were distributed from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 PMN were 27 to 301. There was no correlation between CL values and phagocytic indexes or between CL values and the bacterial number in 100 PMN by limiting the data on Staphylococcus, Streptococcus subsp. and Lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. There was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from PMN by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of PMN. Either catalase activities or SOD activities were measured by H2O2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. Neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of CL response.
TI  - Study by NMR of the mode of action of monensin on Streptococcus faecalis de-energized and energized cells.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis was used as a bacterial model for studying the mode of action of monensin by NMR investigations. Experiments were carried out in two states, characterized by several complementary methods: (i) the resting (de-energized) cell which was considered as an inert biological membrane, on which cationic transport induced by the ionophore alone can be investigated; (ii) the active (energized) cell where the ionophore-sensitive response of the living organism, particularly the cation pumps and the glycolysis, is probed. Studies of resting cells were performed, with changing external ionic concentrations, in the presence of monensin, which is preferentially a sodium carrier. Internal and external Na+ and H+ were followed by corresponding 23Na and 31P (inorganic phosphate) NMR resonances, K+ fluxes were measured by atomic absorption. It was shown that the induced cationic movements were linked to the existing ionic gradients for K+ and Na+. 31P and 13C NMR spectra for the intermediary metabolites detected in active cells showed that glycolysis is dramatically modified in the presence of monensin.
TI  - Transfer of Tn1545 and Tn916 to Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Tn1545, a conjugative transposon originally discovered in Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been transferred from Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis to Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052. Transfer between different strains of C. acetobutylicum has also been observed. Insertion of Tn1545 into the C. acetobutylicum chromosome occurred at multiple sites, as shown by Southern hybridization. Although ermAM (erythromycin-resistance) was the most satisfactory marker for primary selection of transconjugants, all three Tn1545-encoded antibiotic resistance genes (aphA-3, ermAM, and tetM) were apparently expressed in C. acetobutylicum. Our results indicate that Tn1545 is potentially useful for undertaking mutagenesis and mutational cloning in this industrially important organism. Transfer of another conjugative transposon, Tn916, from E. faecalis to C. acetobutylicum NCIB 8052 was also apparently detected. Circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a hot spot for Tn916 insertion in the C. acetobutylicum NCIB 8052 chromosome.
TI  - Daptomycin (LY146032) for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of daptomycin (LY146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. A single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of S. aureus and S. sanguis. Daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of S. epidermidis. A single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. For treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. Daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single daily dose of 600,000 U of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of S. sanguis.
TI  - Teicoplanin in the treatment of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Intravenous teicoplanin has been used to treat 23 cases of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis, usually with 3 to 7 mg/kg every 12 h on the first day, followed by 3 to 7 mg/kg every 24 h. For some cases (staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis), the dosage was 8 to 14.4 mg/kg per day and/or other antibiotics were given. The mean duration was 48.2 days (range, 23 to 130 days). Of 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had negative cultures or were cured. A total of 18 patients were treated with teicoplanin alone; of these, 4 had surgery, and all (except 2 who relapsed) were cured. Teicoplanin was combined with one or more antibiotics in five cases; in all cases appropriate cultures were negative, but three patients died during therapy or follow-up. Mild renal impairment was seen in two patients; both were receiving teicoplanin in combination with an aminoglycoside. We conclude that intravenous teicoplanin administered once a day at doses of 7 to 14 mg/kg per day is well tolerated, easy to administer, and may represent an efficacious therapy for gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - High-level vancomycin-resistant enterococci causing hospital infections.
AB  - Nosocomial infection or colonization due to enterococci with high-level resistance to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentrations [MICs] between 64 and greater than 2000 mg/L) has occurred in 41 patients with renal disease. These vancomycin-resistant enterococci were cultured from many sources including blood. All but one strain contained one or more plasmids ranging in molecular weight from 1.0 to 40 Megadaltons (MDa). Vancomycin resistance was transferable by conjugation to a susceptible recipient strain of Enterococcus faecalis but this was not always associated with plasmid DNA. The emergence of transferable high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci causing significant clinical infections is of particular importance since vancomycin is widely regarded as a reserve drug for the management of infections with multi-resistant Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Endocarditis due to streptomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis with high-level gentamicin resistance.
AB  - A case of community-acquired endocarditis caused by Enterococcus (Streptococcus)  faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin sulfate but not to streptomycin sulfate is described. Killing curves performed using achievable serum levels showed synergistic killing when streptomycin but not gentamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin was combined with penicillin G sodium or vancomycin hydrochloride. Combination therapy with vancomycin and streptomycin resulted in cure. Serum bactericidal levels indicated activity of the synergistic, as well as a nonsynergistic (vancomycin plus gentamicin), combination. Routine screening of blood isolates for high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin can provide guidance for selection of therapeutic combinations in serious enterococcal infections, including endocarditis.
TI  - Enhancement of survival from murine polymicrobial peritonitis with increased abdominal abscess formation.
AB  - Muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a purified synthetic immune adjuvant, has been shown to  increase murine intraabdominal abscess formation in a monomicrobial model using Bacteroides fragilis. This effect required live bacteria and was abolished by appropriate antibiotics. A polymicrobial model of peritonitis and abdominal abscess formation using Streptococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, and B. fragilis was initially used to determine mortality rates at various concentrations and obtain an appropriate LD50. Animals were then pretreated with MDP or its inert buffer and underwent intraperitoneal injection of the appropriate bacterial suspension. Mortality and abdominal abscess formation were then assessed at 2 weeks after injection. There was a significant reduction in mortality (P less than 0.03) in mice treated with MDP compared to the controls. In surviving animals, there was also a significant increase in the number of animals forming abscesses (P less than 0.05) following treatment with MDP. This study has shown that nonspecific immune stimulation by MDP provided enhanced protection against a polymicrobial intraperitoneal challenge and paradoxically increased the formation of abdominal abscesses at the same time. This may be regarded as enhancement of the natural history of survival from peritonitis via bacterial containment through intraabdominal abscess formation, a manifestation of beneficial outcome in experimental peritonitis.
TI  - [Transfer of bacterial drug resistance factor in artificial dental plaque].
AB  - Transfer of drug resistance factor was examined using so-called artificial dental plaque. Clinically isolated specimens of Enterococcus faecalis showing various kind of drug resistance were used as the donors. Streptococcus mutans BHT strain was used as the recipient and the plaque former. S. mutans formed artificial dental plaque on the surface of glass sticks after 7 to 10 day cultivation in brain heart infusion medium containing 5% sucrose. Each strain of E. faecalis was added to the plaque culture and co-cultured further 24 hours. Colonies were formed on drug-containing plates by 5 different mixed cultures with the frequencies of 10(-5)-10(-6) (kanamycin, KM) and 10(-4)-10(-8) (erythromycin, EM). Since these values were higher than that of the mutation frequency, we conclude that the resistant sublines were formed by a genetic transfer. Plasmid DNA derived from some transferred sublines was electrophoreted and the patterns were compared with those from the donor and the recipient. One KM-resistant subline showed a new band at the point of 40 kb which was not found in the plasmid DNA from the donor. It is suggested that the plasmid containing KM-resistance gene was modified molucularly. Sublines without new plasmid band were obtained also. There may be technical problems with it, or the transferred gene may be incorporated in a chromosome. Considering above results, the effect of bacterial transferable genes on oral hygiene were discussed.
TI  - Purification and characterization of human neutrophil peptide 4, a novel member of the defensin family.
AB  - Primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils contain proteins which play a major role in the killing and digestion of bacteria in the phagolysosome. We have isolated and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide from the azurophil granule fraction of discontinuous Percoll gradients. We have named this peptide human neutrophil peptide 4 (HNP-4) based on its structural similarity to a group of antimicrobial polypeptides known as defensins (HNP 1-3). Using size exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, HNP-4 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence determined from isolated HNP-4 and from tryptic fragments of reduced and alkylated peptide is: NH2-Val-Cys-Ser-Cys-Arg-Leu-Val-Phe-Cys-Arg-Arg-Thr-Glu- Leu-Arg-Val-Gly-Asn-Cys-Leu-Ile-Gly-Gly-Val-Ser-Phe-Thr-Tyr-Cys-Cys-Thr- Arg-Val - COOH. Based on this sequence, HNP-4 has a calculated molecular weight of 3715 and a theoretical pI of 8.61. HNP-4 shows structural similarity to the family of three human defensins. HNP-4 and the defensins have identical cysteine backbones and, like the defensins, HNP-4 is rich in arginine (15.2 mol %). However, the amino acids at 22 of the 33 positions differ between HNP-4 and human defensins. Further, HNP-4 is significantly more hydrophobic than the defensins, as determined by its retention time on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro, purified HNP-4 was shown to kill Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Compared to a mixture of the other human defensins, HNP-4 was found to be approximately 100 times more potent against E. coli and four times more potent against both S. faecalis and C. albicans.
TI  - [The influence of cefpodoxime proxetil on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The influence of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. CPDX-PR dry syrup was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of bacteria: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. No notable changes were observed in fecal viable cell counts except that slight decreases of E. coli counts were observed on the days 3 to 5 after starting administration. The subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with infections, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 1 year 1 month to 6 years 10 months, with their body weights ranging from 9.3 to 23.8 kg. CPDX-PR dry syrup was administered at a dose between 3.0 to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 7 days. Although some variations of the fecal bacterial flora were noticed between subjects during the administration of CPDX-PR, no notable changes were observed in major aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium in 4 of the 5 cases. Large decreases in Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and anaerobic cocci and an increase in Enterococcus were observed in the other case. There was no case in which glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, transitory bacterial replacement was observed within the genus. Fecal concentration of CPDX during the administration of CPDX-PR was extremely low or below the detectable limit except one specimen from a case in which intestinal bacterial flora showed remarkable changes. From the above, CPDX-PR appears to be a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Pathogenicity of enterococci in a rat model of fecal peritonitis.
AB  - The pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. Therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens with or without Streptococcus faecalis. Mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. The presence of S. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. S. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.
TI  - Characterization of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium 180, a clinical isolate from England, was studied. Resistance to vancomycin was transferable by conjugation to other enterococci. Expression of resistance was inducible and coincided with the appearance of a new membrane protein.
TI  - The 1H NMR visibility of intracellular lactate in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - 1H NMR studies of glycolysis in washed cell suspensions of Streptococcus faecalis indicated that intracellular lactate is not 1H NMR visible. Evidence for this was gained from time course studies of glycolysis at increasing concentrations of glucose. A close correlation existed between the relative increase in the lactate integral and the enzymatically determined extracellular lactate concentration [Lo]. When ionophores which cause the collapse of the positive intracellular/extracellular lactate gradient were added to cell suspensions following fermentation of 5, 10 and 50 mM glucose, the increase in the lactate integral was proportional to the respective increase in [Lo]. A more direct method for determining the origin of the lactate signal involved centrifugation of a cell suspension after fermentation of 50 mM glucose and measurement of lactate in the extracellular and intracellular fluid. 1H spectra of the cell suspension, supernatant and sonicated pellet revealed that the lactate observed in the cell suspension was equivalent to the lactate in the supernatant alone. The intracellular lactate contained in the pellet represented 42% of the total lactate, indicating that only 58% of lactate is detected by in vivo 1H MRS of S. faecalis. This result is in contrast with the high percentage (70-90%) of in vitro lactate which is detected by in vivo 1H MRS of mammalian brain tissue (Williams S. R. et al. Magn. Res. Med. 7, 425-431, 1988). This may be due to a higher proportion of extracellular lactate in mammalian tissue or differences in the intracellular environments of bacterial and mammalian cells.
TI  - [Experimental and clinical studies on cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - 1. Absorption and elimination Serum and urinary levels of cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221) were determined in 7 children with ages ranging from 3 to 12 years after a intravenous bolus injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. The average serum level of the drug was 119.27 +/- 13.83 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, then decreased gradually with a half-life of 2.01 +/- 0.25 hours to 10.56 +/- 2.93 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The average urinary elimination rate was 77.34 +/- 12.60%. 2. Clinical study CDZM was given to the following 39 patients with ages ranging from 2 months to 15 years and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. The treated cases were 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 30 cases of acute pneumonia, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media and 2 cases of acute urinary tract infections. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 29 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.1%. Organisms presumed to be pathogens included 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9 Haemophilus influenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain and 8 non-producing strains) and 1 Enterococcus faecalis. The last one was decreased and the others were eradicated with an eradication rate of 93.3% for all strains. Adverse reactions occurred in no patients. Abnormal changes in laboratory test values involved only 1 case each of elevated GOT, elevated GOT and GPT, eosinophilia and thrombocytosis. Based on the above-mentioned result and features of this drug, it was confirmed that this drug showed an excellent usefulness in the treatment of infections in childhood. It may be also effective in the management of infections under immunosuppression.
TI  - Evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from May 1985 to August 1987. A total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. The mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). The diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. The tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. Isolates from blood were 12 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus hominis, 1 Micrococcus sedentarius, 1 Enterococcus faecalis, 3 Streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable Streptococcus sp. At the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). Of these 14 patients, one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. Thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). Mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower, 23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). Side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. These side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. This study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.
TI  - 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin (TMC-016): synthesis and biological properties of  a unique 16-membered macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin was synthesized by the following synthetic route:  19-Deformylation of desmycosin, 3,2',4''-tri-O-trimethylsilylation, 4'-O-sulfonylation, 4'-iodination, reductive deiodination and 3,2',4''-tri-O-detrimethylsilylation. Deformylation of the aldehyde group at the C-19 position was achieved by two different methods: A) A simple one-step deformylation using Wilkinson's catalyst ((Ph3P)3RhCl). B) Reductive decarboxylation of the 19-carboxyl derivative following NaClO2 oxidation of the aldehyde. 19-Deformyl-4'-deoxydesmycosin showed very strong antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of IPM and CS sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were 37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of IPM/CS at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Mean plasma concentrations of IPM reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. The concentration of IPM in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. Concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were 0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. While, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of CS were higher than those of IPM, mean plasma half-lives of CS were similar to IPM. 2. IPM/CS was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Causative organisms isolated from these patients included 3 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All the organisms were eradicated by IPM/CS, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. No adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased GOT in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. These changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of IPM/CS. It was concluded that the clinical results of IPM/CS are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Saliva-mediated aggregation of Enterococcus faecalis transformed with a Streptococcus sanguis gene encoding the SSP-5 surface antigen.
AB  - The interaction of a high-molecular-weight salivary glycoprotein (agglutinin) with Streptococcus sanguis M5 leads to the formation of bacterial aggregates. We have previously shown that the SSP-5 surface antigen from S. sanguis M5 binds the salivary agglutinin and therefore may be involved in the aggregation process. Here we report the transformation of a nonaggregating Enterococcus faecalis strain with the SSP-5 gene and show that the protein is expressed on the cell surface and confers an aggregation-positive phenotype. E. faecalis S161 protoplasts were transformed with pAM401 EB-5, a shuttle vector containing the S. sanguis SSP-5 gene, resulting in the isolation of E. faecalis S161EB-5. Crude cell extracts from this transformant and from S. sanguis M5 were analyzed by Western blotting. Extracts from S. sanguis M5 possessed peptides of 190 and 205 kilodaltons that reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant SSP-5 antigen. E. faecalis S161EB-5 contained only the 190-kilodalton immunoreactive protein, suggesting that the antigen may be processed differently in E. faecalis S161EB-5. The parent strain, E. faecalis S161, did not react with this antibody preparation. Immunogold labeling of intact E. faecalis S161EB-5 and S. sanguis M5 with anti-SSP-5 immunoglobulin G showed that both organisms expressed similar levels of the antigen. Both organisms formed visible aggregates upon incubation with salivary agglutinin. These results suggest that the SSP-5 antigen may mediate both the binding of agglutinin to S. sanguis M5 and the subsequent formation of bacterial aggregates.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin in the urine during the 4 days following  a single 400 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin was studied in the urine after single dose of 400 mg in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 7 periods: 0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h. Lomefloxacin concentration were assayed in all samples by microbiological method. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis. MIC's of lomefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.06, 0.50, 0.50, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin mean concentrations were 208.5 +/- 44.2, 104.3 +/- 15.2, 100.5 +/- 17.9, 36.8 +/- 8.2, 9.6 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples. Low levels were present in urine the 4th day. Mean urine elimination percentage was 62.2 +/- 4.2% for the four days, with extreme values from 91.2 to 41.8%. Urine bacteriostatic activity against enterobacteriacae was greater than or equal to 32 the first day reaching 8,192 for the Nal-S E. Coli, it was greater than or equal to 4 the second day. Against staphylococcus it was greater than or equal to 64 the first day, greater than or equal to 16 the second day. Against enterococcus it was greater than or equal to 4 the first day. Against the strains implicated in UTI a bacteriostatic activity was present during 2 days in all subjects.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin in the urine during the 7 days following a  single 800 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 800  mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 9 periods: 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-28 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h, 96-120 h, 120-144 h, 144-168 h. Pefloxacin concentrations were assayed in all samples by a microbiological method and by HPLC. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis; MIC's of pefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.015, 0.25, 1, 0.50 and 2 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin mean concentrations as determined by the microbiological method were 91.8 +/- 11.9, 71.7 +/- 7, 44.5 +/- 4.3, 24.4 +/- 4 and 5.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples; low levels were present in the urine until the 7th day in 8 volunteers. HPLC results completed the already known data concerning pefloxacin elimination and metabolism; unchanged pefloxacin was excreted at the highest concentration during the 6 first hours; then demethylpefloxacin was eliminated at higher levels than pefloxacin with a ratio of 2/1 after the 24th hour. These two compounds were detectable in the urine during 5 to 7 days; oxodemethylpefloxacin and N-oxyde-pefloxacin were present in lower amounts and during a shorter period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  - To evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. Enterobacteriaceae (EB), streptococci D (STR D), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. The MIC of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. Ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. A moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for EB, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. There was no significant effect for STR D. The MIC of roxithromycin for EB increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). For STR. D, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). The bacteria with low MIC (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for EB and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for STR. D) are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium. The MIC increased for the three macrolides tested.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in Aerococcus viridans.
AB  - Resistance to at least one of the following antibiotics was found in eight wild-type strains of Aerococcus viridans: erythromycin (six strains), tetracycline and minocycline (five strains), chloramphenicol (one strain), and high levels of streptomycin (one strain). None of the strains transferred any of their antibiotic resistance markers into streptococcal, enterococcal, or A. viridans recipients by conjugation. By DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, the ermB gene of transposon Tn917, of Enterococcus faecalis origin, was detected in five of the six strains resistant to erythromycin and was localized for one strain on the chromosome and for four strains on nonconjugative small (4.7- to 4.9-kilobase) plasmids. The tetM gene of the conjugative transposon Tn916, of E. faecalis origin, was localized on the chromosome of four of the five strains resistant to tetracycline and minocycline; in three of these strains a structure similar to that of Tn916 was found. Homology to the tetO gene of pUA466, of Campylobacter jejuni origin, was detected on the chromosome of the fifth strain. No sequence homology was detected in any strain with probes corresponding to the tetL gene of group B Streptococcus origin, to the ermA gene of the transposon Tn554 of Staphylococcus aureus origin, or to the cat genes of either pC194 or pC221 of S. aureus origin.
TI  - The enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
AB  - Investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. To characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center (DVAMC) in 1986 were reviewed. During this period, 220 Enterococcus faecalis, 21 Enterococcus faecium, 12 Enterococcus avium, and no Enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the DVAMC microbiology laboratory. Clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. Nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence of the three enterococcal species. Enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. Although Enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. E. avium was more resistant than E. faecalis or E. faecium to penicillin G and ampicillin and less resistant to most other antimicrobial agents. The results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.
TI  - [Bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin alone or in combination with  tobramycin, netilmicin or ampicillin against enterococcus].
AB  - The in vitro bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin alone or in combination was studied against enterococci in a microtiter checkerboard assay and by kill-kinetic experiments. Daptomycin was more active than vancomycin and was bactericidal. Better Fractional Bactericidal Concentration indices were observed with combinations of vancomycin with aminoglycosides, but in kill-kinetic studies, the combinations of 4 MICs of daptomycin with 4 mg/l of tobramycin or netilmicin produced the more lethal effect; these combinations were even more lethal than ampicillin and aminoglycosides in the same conditions. While vancomycin and ampicillin were antagonistic, synergistic FBC indices were observed with daptomycin and ampicillin in combination, but at 4 MICs of each antibiotic, the combination was less bactericidal than ampicillin alone. The bactericidal effect obtained with daptomycin in combination with aminoglycosides suggest that further evaluation of these combinations in enterococcal endocarditis could have a clinical interest if this bactericidal effect was confirmed by in vivo studies.
TI  - In vitro synergism between daptomycin and fosfomycin against Enterococcus faecalis isolates with high-level gentamicin resistance.
AB  - Daptomycin and fosfomycin are two agents which inhibit different steps in peptidoglycan synthesis. We studied the in vitro activities of these drugs, alone and in combination, by time-kill techniques against 21 clinical isolates of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis demonstrating high-level resistance to gentamicin. Combinations of fosfomycin and daptomycin exhibited synergistic bactericidal activity (100-fold decrease in CFU per milliliter at 24 h compared with daptomycin alone) against all strains (mean +/- standard deviation of increment in killing = 2.7 +/- 0.7 log10 CFU/ml). In a subgroup of strains against which daptomycin (5 micrograms/ml) alone was bactericidal (greater than 3 log10 killing), synergistic activity was demonstrable only when the concentration of daptomycin was lowered to 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml. A 50% dilution of human serum diminished the bactericidal activity of daptomycin alone at 24 h but did not affect killing observed with the daptomycin-fosfomycin combination. The inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by the combination was greater than the inhibition observed with either drug alone. The combination of daptomycin and fosfomycin exhibited consistent synergistic bactericidal activity against strains of E. faecalis possessing high-level resistance to gentamicin. This synergism may be the result of sequential inhibition of early steps in peptidoglycan synthesis.
TI  - Effects of spermine and spermidine on the inorganic pyrophosphatase of Streptococcus faecalis. Interactions between polyamines and inorganic pyrophosphate.
AB  - We have shown a dual role for Mg2+ in the hydrolysis of PPi catalysed by inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase; EC 3.6.1.1) of Streptococcus faecalis; Mg2+ is necessary for the formation of the substrates, Mg1PPi2- and Mg2PPi0, and it also acts as an allosteric activator [Lahti + Jokinen (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3526-3530]. No activity can be observed with S. faecalis PPase in the absence of bivalent cations, which indicates that free PPi cannot serve as a substrate for this enzyme. However, significant activities were observed in the presence of spermine and spermidine, even though no bivalent cations were present. It was shown by particle-induced gamma-ray emission and particle-induced X-ray-emission analysis that the polyamines used were not contaminated with Mg2+ or any other bivalent cations that could support PPase activity. Hence it is obvious that polyamines are able to form a complex with PPi that serves as a substrate for PPase. The apparent stability constants for the 1:1 adducts of spermine and spermidine were estimated by a resin competition method. The values obtained at pH 7.5 were 2.7 X 10(3) M-1 and 6.4 X 10(2) M-1 respectively. Kinetic results further suggested that polyamines can also substitute for Mg2+ as an activator in vitro. The physiological significance of these polyamine effects were discussed.
TI  - [Reactivity of human lymphocytes to yeast-like and mold fungi].
AB  - The capacity of the allergens of mold fungi (Rhizopus nigricans, Mucor pusillus,  Alternaria tenuis, Cladosporum herbarum, Fusarium oxysporum) and yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans) to induce the production of lymphokins by human lymphocytes was studied. All these preparations were active in reactions with lymphocytes obtained from adult donors, but did not activate lymphocytes of newborns (obtained from umbilical blood). In equal doses (10 micrograms/ml) C. albicans allergen was more active than the preparations of mold fungi. The capacity of bacterial allergens to stimulate human lymphocytes was found to be either more pronounced (in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) than that of the preparation of C. albicans or equal to it (in Streptococcus faecalis). The results thus obtained may be regarded as the manifestation of immunological contacts with the antigens of different microorganisms, as well as the evidence of the immunological nature of lymphocytic reactions to preparations intended for use in clinical allergology.
TI  - Purification and amino acid composition of peptide antibiotic AS-48 produced by Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis subsp. liquefaciens S-48.
AB  - Peptide antibiotic AS-48 was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The purified fraction was active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. AS-48 is a basic protein with an isoelectric point of ca. 10.5 and a molecular mass of 7.4 kilodaltons. Its inhibitory activity was markedly affected by sodium dodecyl sulfate and cardiolipin but not by neuraminidase, pectinase, beta-glucosidase, or beta-glucuronidase. Differential scanning calorimetry data suggested that AS-48 molecules lack a compact structure.
TI  - Characterization of the human neutrophil response to sex pheromones from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Synthetic analogs of sex pheromones from Streptococcus faecalis and related pheromone inhibitors have been assayed for their possible effects on human neutrophil leukocyte activation. These sex pheromones are hydrophobic peptides that have regulatory roles in bacterial mating behavior leading to intercellular plasmid transfer. Five of the seven peptides tested were chemotactic for neutrophils in the 10(-5) to 10(-6) M concentration range. Exposure of neutrophils to these same peptides induced polarization of the cells and triggered superoxide production. Cross-desensitization experiments suggest that S. faecalis bacterial peptides act via the fMLF-receptor on neutrophils. This conclusion is supported by the results that leukocyte polarization responses induced by synthetic analogs of S. faecalis sex pheromones can be blocked by t-Boc-FLFLF, a known antagonist of fMLF. It is concluded that inflammatory properties of bacterial supernatants, particularly in the case of S. faecalis strains and perhaps in other bacterial genuses, are contributed in part by nonformylated hydrophobic oligopeptides that recognize and act through the fMLF receptor to activate neutrophils.
TI  - Regulation of the cytoplasmic pH by a proton-translocating ATPase in Streptococcus faecalis (faecium). A computer simulation.
AB  - Earlier work from this laboratory led to the proposal that the cytoplasmic pH of  streptococcal cells is regulated solely by changes in the amount and activity of a proton-translocating ATPase, F1F0 complex [Kobayashi, H., Suzuki, T. & Unemoto, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 627-630]. We have now examined the proposal with the aid of computer simulation. We find that an increase in the amount of the H+-ATPase is necessary for pH regulation and is sufficient to maintain a constant steady-state cytoplasmic pH. An increase in H+-ATPase activity is insufficient by itself to maintain a constant cytoplasmic pH, but suppresses the initial fluctuation of the pH. When both variations were allowed, the simulated cytoplasmic pH remained constant despite large perturbations, suggesting that this regulatory system has ample capacity to compensate for pH changes. The present work shows that a computer simulation is a useful way to examine a model for biological regulatory system; application of the simulation to other regulatory systems is discussed.
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activity of cefpirome (HR 810) against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - With cefpirome (HR 810) the MICs for both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for Streptococcus faecalis were 8.0 mg/l. At 4 x MIC, cefpirome killed MRSA as rapidly as did vancomycin while for enterococci, cefpirome, vancomycin or ampicillin alone were not bactericidal. However, all agents were bactericidal when combined with 2 mg/l of gentamicin, although gentamicin combined with cefpirome showed a smaller decrease in cfu/ml than the combination with ampicillin or vancomycin. A mouse thigh infection model was developed in which the thigh muscle was infected with bacteria and either no therapy or concurrent antibiotic therapy was initiated. On the subsequent day, the entire thigh muscle was quantitatively cultured. In this model, the numbers of enterococci at the infection site at 24 h were reduced by 2.1 logs with no treatment, 2.6 with cefpirome (25 mg/kg/day), 2.8 with ampicillin (150 mg/kg/day), and 2.7 with vancomycin (25 mg/kg/day). For MRSA the reductions were 1.1 logs with no therapy, 2.8 with vancomycin, and 3.0 with cefpirome. The apparent enhanced in-vivo activity of cefpirome for MRSA argues for further evaluation of this antibiotic for treatment of MRSA and other Gram-positive cocci, including enterococci.
TI  - Endocarditis due to Streptococcus faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin.
AB  - Recently, reports of Streptococcus faecalis with resistance to high levels of gentamicin have appeared in the literature, although there have been no previous reports of endocarditis due to such organisms. In this article, two cases of endocarditis--both due to Streptococcus faecalis with high-level gentamicin resistance and both presenting in an atypical manner--are described. The data suggest that a high level of suspicion regarding a diagnosis of endocarditis must be maintained in such cases and that, once a case is diagnosed, careful evaluation in the microbiology laboratory is helpful in determining the optimal antimicrobial regimen.
TI  - Intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  - One hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. Of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). Significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. Eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common isolates. Six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. This review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.
TI  - Purification and substrate specificity of a strongly hydrophobic extracellular metalloendopeptidase ("gelatinase") from Streptococcus faecalis (strain 0G1-10).
AB  - An extracellular Zn-endopeptidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrates of Streptococcus faecalis (human oral strain 0G1-10) by a procedure that comprised concentration in an Amicon Hollow Fiber System, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel permeation chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (batch operation on phenyl-sepharose Cl-4B), followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column, and finally FPLC on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. The enzyme is a 31.5-kDa strongly hydrophobic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.6 and a broad pH optimum of 6 to 8. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is similar to that of the mammalian membrane endopeptidase-24.11 and Streptococcus thermophilus thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.4) in hydrolyzing preferentially the Phe24-Phe25 bond in insulin B-chain, followed by cleavage of the His5-Leu6 bond. The enzyme was especially active on Azocoll and gelatin; soluble and insoluble collagens were hydrolyzed at a lower rate. S. faecalis sex pheromone-related peptides and several mammalian bioactive peptides were cleaved at sites involving pronounced hydrophobicity. The enzyme did not hydrolyze small synthetic peptide derivatives (phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-L-Pro-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-D-Arg and 2-furylacryloyl-L-Leu-Gly-L-Ala) that are typically attacked by "true" bacterial collagenases. Chemical modification indicated the importance of histidyl, carboxyl, and tyrosyl groups in enzyme activity, suggesting that this enzyme may thus be classified as a metalloprotease II (EC 3.4.24.4). The enzyme is strongly inhibited by a 720-kDa factor present in rat inflammatory exudate. The pronounced ability of the enzyme to attack collagenous materials and certain bioactive peptides suggests its participation in inflammatory processes involving the presence of S. faecalis.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Hemagglutination activities of group B, C, D, and G streptococci: demonstration of novel sugar-specific cell-binding activities in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A total of 378 streptococcal isolates of Lancefield groups B, C, D and G were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate untreated, sialidase-treated, and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated human erythrocytes. Of the 43 strains showing positive hemagglutination, 9 were inhibitable with neutral monosaccharides. Four strains were inhibited with galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, whereas five were inhibited with galactose only. A third, sialic acid-specific adhesion activity was suggested for two additional strains on the basis of their agglutination of native and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated but not sialidase-treated erythrocytes. All the sugar-specific agglutination activities detected were confined to Streptococcus suis strains of group D streptococci, whereas streptococci of other groups did not exhibit these types of hemagglutination activities. The adhesins were sensitive to proteases and heat treatment, which indicates that they were proteins. The hemagglutinating isolates of S. suis originated from pig brain and lung, human brain, and the tonsils of healthy pigs. No clear correlation with a particular serotype was observed. These results demonstrate the occurrence of unique sugar-specific adherence activities in S. suis, an important pig pathogen with occasional human pathogenicity.
TI  - New approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis: review of 100 consecutive cases.
AB  - To assess the effect of our new, more aggressive approach to treating infective endocarditis, we retrospectively reviewed our recent experience with this disease. Between 1983 and 1989, we treated 100 patients with endocarditis, in 94 of whom the diagnosis was confirmed. Fifty-four (57%) of the 94 patients had native valve endocarditis, and the other 40 patients (43%) had prosthetic valve endocarditis. The patients' mean ages were 50 years for native valve disease and 58 years for prosthetic valve disease (p < 0.05). The male-to-female ratio was 4:1. Among the patients with confirmed endocarditis, 87 (93%) had significant underlying risk factors for endocarditis. Upon physical examination of the 94 patients, 16 (17%) were afebrile, 15 (16%) had negative blood cultures, and 26 (28%) had no cardiovascular symptoms or immunologic findings. Echocardiography was of limited value: its sensitivity was 56% for native valve endocarditis and 33% for prosthetic valve endocarditis. The ratio of affected valves was 5 aortic:4 mitral: 1 tricuspid in both forms of the disease. Viridans streptococcus was isolated in 23 (25%) of the confirmed cases, Enterococcus faecalis in 17 (18%), Staphylococcus aureus in 13 (14%), and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 14 (15%). Gram-negative, anaerobic, and fungal organisms accounted for only 13 (14%) of the confirmed cases. The mean duration of intravenous therapy was 29 days. Twenty (37%) of the native valve patients and 16 (40%) of the prosthetic valve patients received antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Vancomycin was used in 44 (47%) of the cases, nafcillin or ampicillin in 40 (44%), and other beta-lactam agents in 9 (10%). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer for prosthetic valve endocarditis patients than for those with native valve disease (29 versus 23 days; p < 0.01). Cardiac catheterization was performed in 9 native valve patients (17%) and 6 prosthetic valve patients (15%). Valve surgery was performed in 33 native valve patients (61%) and 22 prosthetic valve patients (55%). Failure, defined as in-hospital death or recurrent endocarditis, accounted for 14 (28%) of the native valve cases (17% death and 11% relapse) and 8 (20%) of the prosthetic valve cases (10% death and 10% relapse), for an overall failure rate of 24%. The rate of failure was independent of the infecting pathogen or the type of antimicrobial therapy applied. Our experience verified that, in many patients with significant underlying risk factors, the diagnosis of endocarditis may be made on an empiric basis.
TI  - Leukopenia with neutropenia associated with teicoplanin therapy.
AB  - The first case report of leukopenia with neutropenia due to the new glycopeptide  antibiotic teicoplanin is described. The side effect occurred in a 73-year-old man hospitalized because of subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus faecalis. Leukopenia with neutropenia (white blood cells 2000/mm3, neutrophils 46%) developed after 20 days of teicoplanin therapy. After stopping teicoplanin white blood cell and neutrophil counts reverted to normal, but dropped again on rechallenge. A review of 1500 records of patients treated with teicoplanin alone or in combination with other drugs was also performed. Five cases were found in which leukopenia was possibly (four cases) or probably (one case) related to teicoplanin therapy. From these preliminary data the incidence of leukopenia related to teicoplanin seems to be low.
TI  - Transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4165 and BM4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (LY146032). Strain BM4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to MLS antibiotics in strain BM4165 were carried on plasmids pIP819 and pIP821, respectively; pIP819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to MLS antibiotics. The two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other E. faecium strains. Plasmid pIP819 could also conjugate to E. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, S. pyogenes, S. lactis, and Listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to S. aureus. Glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. Based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of the products of Streptococcus faecalis inhibiting mycelial transformation of Candida albicans].
AB  - An attempt was made to isolate and identify Streptococcus faecalis products responsible for the inhibition of mycelial transformation of Candida albicans. Five of streptococcal strains which 48 h broth culture supernatants run at 37 degrees C inhibited the most transformation of Candida albicans from yeast phase to mycelial phage. The strains were cultivated for 48 h in Tryptic Soy Broth at 37 degrees C, centrifuged and culture supernatants sterilised by means of filtration on millipore membranes of 0.4 micron diameter. After multistep purification of supernatants filtration on Diaflo PM 10 ultrafiltration membranes, Sephadex G 25, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) a homogenous, active fraction was obtained containing peptides of molecular weight around 6,000 Da. The peptides lost ability to induce mycelial transformation of C. albicans after heating at 100 degrees C for 10 min. Significant inhibition of morphological transformation of fungal cells was seen at the preparation concentration of 0.12 microgram/ml.
TI  - [Effect of selected bacteria on mycelial transformation of cells of Candida albicans].
AB  - Influence of selected bacteria representing typical physiological flora of mucous membranes of man on transformation of Candida albicans from yeast phase to mycelial phase was evaluated, E. coli, S. viridans and S. faecalis inhibited to different degree mycelial transformation of fungal cells. A degree of inhibition in the case of E. coli was proportional to the period of preliminary culture of strains in medium containing serum while streptococci inhibited mycelial transformation mainly after 4 and 24 hr of preliminary culture. Production of factor(s) inhibiting mycelial transformation of C. albicans by E. coli was induced by direct contact with fungal cells and by low molecular weight substances produced by C. albicans. Streptococci produced inhibiting factors even when fungal cells or their metabolites were absent in the medium.
TI  - Some properties of Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens isolated from cheese with special reference to production of bitterness.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was examined for proteolysis and development of bitterness in sterile buffaloes' skim milk with and without some additives. Cell population and the pH of milk were the most important factors in the breakdown of casein and development of bitterness. Sodium chloride level, altering the final concentration of bacteria in milk, had a direct role in the production of bitter peptides. Calcium ions up to 5 mM did not affect proteolysis whereas higher concentrations were inhibitory. Electrophoretic analysis of proteose-peptone formed in sterile skim milk with and without NaCl revealed the presence of 3 peptides, 2 of which were probably associated with bitterness. S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens produced acidity slowly, but was the most acid producer (1.25% after 72 h) of the streptococci. However, milk coagulated enzymatically and the curd shrinkage was related to salt-dependent acidity. Strains of the organism coagulated fresh citrated human plasma within 21 h at 30 degrees C, but without any visible fibrinolysis. The strains also were all alpha-haemolytic with occasionally a very few beta-haemolytic variants on sheep blood agar. On human blood agar, a weak alpha-reaction was given.
TI  - Bactericidal and bacteriolytic action of peptide antibiotic AS-48 against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms.
AB  - A purified peptide antibiotic AS-48 from Streptococcus faecalis spp liquiefaciens S-48 exerted a bactericidal mode of action against most Gram-positive and many Gram-negative bacteria tested. In many Gram-positive bacteria and the two Myxococcus species assayed, a bacteriolytic effect, as a consequence of primary lesions, was also observed. In general, the Gram-negative bacteria were more resistant to AS-48. Escherichia coli protoplasts showed increased sensitivity and those of a resistant yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3.2, became sensitive. These data suggest that resistance is related to the cell wall structure. AS-48 adsorbed rapidly to cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes of sensitive and resistant cells. Adsorption to cytoplasmic membranes involved complete neutralization of AS-48.
TI  - False resistance of Streptococcus faecalis to enoxacin by disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  
TI  - Binding of fibronectin and albumin to Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis.
AB  - Binding of human fibronectin (FN) and albumin to Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis was investigated. Scatchard analysis showed that the cells could bind a maximum of 1300 molecules of FN with an association constant of 4.8 x 10(6) M-1. Binding did not appear to involve lipoteichoic acid. Heating the cells or pretreatment with protease or periodate reduced the binding, suggesting the involvement of protein and/or carbohydrate-containing components as the surface receptor. The cells could bind a maximum of 50,000 molecules of albumin but with a much lower affinity than FN (association constant 10.8 x 10(3) M-1). Surface hydrophobicity of E. faecalis was markedly decreased by albumin but not by FN.
TI  - [Streptococcus bovis septicemia and colonic cancer].
AB  - The authors report the case of a patient who developed a Streptococcus Bovis septicemia in the post-operative course of a surgical cure of an incarcerated umbilical hernia. There were no other complaints. A barium enema showed a malignant tumor of the descending colon. There were hepatic metastases. No complementary treatment was undertaken. The patient died shortly after. In the literature colonic proliferative lesions in association with this germ is reported in a total of 36% of proliferative lesions (15% of cancers and 21% of adenomas). It is concluded that the discovery of a malignant or premalignant proliferative lesion in one third of the cases justifies the exploration of the colon by barium enema and/or colonoscopy in the case of Streptococcus Bovis septicemia. The discovery of other digestive lesions (malignant or not) seems to be coincidental.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of Bacillus subtilis: nucleotide sequence of ptsX, ptsH and the 5'-end of ptsI and evidence for a ptsHI operon.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 1689bp fragment of the Bacillus subtilis locus containing ptsX (a crr-like gene), ptsH (coding for HPr), and the 5'-end of ptsI (coding for Enzyme I) was determined. The deduced amino acid sequences of ptsH and the N-terminal part of ptsI were compared to those of Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Transcription fusion demonstrated that ptsHI constitutes an operon. An open reading frame overlapping the main part of ptsH in the opposite sense was shown to be expressed in vivo, using protein fusions with beta-galactosidase. The deduced amino acid sequence of ptsX showed significant homology with that of Salmonella typhimurium glucose-specific Enzyme III. ptsX was preceded by an open reading frame whose amino acid sequence showed strong homology with the C-terminal part of E. coli Enzyme IIGlc.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis arthritis.
AB  - Septic arthritis due to Streptococcus faecalis is rare. We describe a case in which synovial biopsy was required for diagnosis and a new longterm antibiotic combination using ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin was successful in treating the infection. Comparison is made with previous reported cases and the usual poor outcome in this condition.
TI  - In vitro activity of ampicillin/sulbactam against enterococci determined by the time-kill method.
AB  - Time-kill studies demonstrated that at clinically achievable serum concentrations, ampicillin/sulbactam was equivalent in activity to ampicillin alone against non-beta-lactamase producing isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Sulbactam possessed no antibacterial activity against these organisms. It is not yet known if the activity of ampicillin will be increased with the addition of sulbactam when tested against beta-lactamase-producing enterococci.
TI  - Stimulating effect of Streptococcus faecalis on phagocytosis in gnotobiotic piglets.
AB  - The concentration of active phagocytes in peripheral blood remained in germfree pigs up to the age of one year approximately at the same level as found at the age of 7 d and did not exceed 0.3 X 10(9)/L of blood, whereas a steady increase was established in conventional pigs. Monoassociation of gnotobiotic piglets with Streptococcus faecalis increased during 24 h the concentration of circulating granulocytes and the concentration of active phagocytes. An even more pronounced effect was obtained when formolized S. faecalis cells were applied intraperitoneally to germfree piglets. This treatment elevated the phagocytosis index also in conventional piglets, as well as in germfree piglets previously given cyclophosphamide. Escherichia coli O 83 or a mixture of anaerobic bacteria did not cause any serious changes in the activity of phagocytosis in gnotobiotic piglets. S. faecalis seems to be a natural factor stimulating both the release of granulocytes from their depots as well as their phagocytic activity.
TI  - Further studies on post-antibiotic effect and synergism in two strains of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The differences in the synergistic potential for either killing effect or increase in duration of post-antibiotic effect (PAE) seen with various beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combinations in two strains of Streptococcus faecalis were further studied to examine this relationship in more detail. It was seen that a strain which produced a synergistic increase in recovery period (PAE greater than or equal to 0.5 h), comparing the beta-lactam antibiotics alone and when combined with streptomycin, showed increased sensitivity (greater than or equal to 1 log10 reduction in viable counts) to a subinhibitory concentration of streptomycin added to a culture recovering from the PAE; this was not demonstrated with a strain showing no increase in PAE when briefly exposed to a combination therapy, although its corresponding killing curve was clearly synergistic. Moreover, it was seen that the differences in the synergistic prolongation of recovery period when combining various aminoglycosides at 1/4 x MIC with ampicillin were consistent with the different duration of PAE with the particular aminoglycoside alone at the MIC.
TI  - Synergism and mechanism of subinhibitory concentration of streptomycin on Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The influence of various incubation conditions on synergism with cell wall-active agents combined with streptomycin was studied in a Streptococcus faecalis strain. It could be shown that both a synergistic increased killing effect and a synergistic prolongation of post-antibiotic effect (PAE) were not dependent on an active process, as they occurred both in an anaerobic atmosphere and when an electron transport inhibitor (sodium azide) was added to the media. Moreover, it was demonstrated that if a drug, alone or in combination with streptomycin, had a PAE, there was an increased susceptibility to a subinhibitory concentration of streptomycin (1/4xMIC) when added to a culture recovering from its PAE. These findings confirm the commonly held belief in a mechanistic mechanism of synergism: That cell wall-active agents modify in some way the cell-envelope, thereby enhancing aminoglycoside uptake and killing in Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activities of cefixime and seven comparative oral antimicrobials were studied. MIC90S of cefixime were 0.015-1 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus, Providencia, Aeromonas hydrophila and Streptococcus. MIC90S for other Enterobacteriaceae were greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml; 44% of those strains were inhibited by less than or equal 1 microgram/ml. Staphylococcus, Psuedomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were resistant to cefixime.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - A medium for the detection of Lancefield Group D cocci in skimmed milk powder by  measurement of conductivity changes.
AB  - A selective medium for the detection of Lancefield Group D cocci in skimmed milk  powder by conductivity measurements was developed and evaluated using the Bactometer M123 and Malthus 128H systems. This medium promoted large changes in conductance and capacitance. The calibration curve of detection times vs concentration of Lancefield Group D cocci showed a linear correlation coefficient of 0.93 and the method gave comparable results in both conductivity instruments. Naturally contaminated samples containing c. 10(3) cfu/g of Lancefield Group D cocci gave detection times within 16-18 h which was sufficiently rapid for the medium to be used for the routine screening of skimmed milk powder.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of BALB/c mice.
AB  - In the oral cavities of BALB/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. Factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. In this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of BALB/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. Among the predominant species, all the S. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the Lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. In S. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. Macrolides (M), lincosamides (L), streptogramin B (S), tetracycline (Tc), and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among S. faecalis isolates. Hemolytic (Hly+) streptococci were less resistant to MLS, Tc, and Cm than were non-hemolytic (Hly-) isolates. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). The frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (S. mutans LG-1, S. sanguis Ny 101, and A. viscosus Ny 1) were high for L. murinus (76%) and S. faecalis (57% for Hly- and 90% for Hly+), but low for S. aureus (7%). These results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Factors affecting transfer frequency of pAM beta 1 from Streptococcus faecalis to Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Conjugal transfer of streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 to Lactobacillus plantarum  by a filter mating method was examined under various conditions. The transfer frequency depended greatly on the type, pore size, and side (front or back) of the membrane filter. The passage of sterilized water through the membrane under reduced pressure after donor and recipient cells were trapped on it increased the transfer frequency about 10-fold.
TI  - Ion-conducting channels in a gram-positive bacterium.
AB  - The patch-clamp technique was used to obtain information on the existence and properties of ion channels in giant protoplasts obtained from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus faecalis. The membrane proved to contain a pore with numerous conductance states, ranging from 10 pS to several nanosiemens. Application of a slight pressure differential across the membrane resulted in the activation of the channel. The pressure sensitivity points to a relationship between this channel and one recently discovered in E. coli spheroplasts [(1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 2297-2301] suggesting that pores of this type might be widespread among prokaryotes.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonatal infections].
AB  - Ten patients with infections (8 neonates and 2 infants) were treated with 10.2 mg/10.2 mg/kg-37.7 mg/37.7 mg/kg of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) b.i.d. or t.i.d. by a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. The plasma concentrations of IPM/CS were determined in 5 of the 10 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient of the 5. 1. The patients studied included 5 with pneumonia and 1 each with urinary tract infection, omphalitis, suspected meningitis, periproctal abscess and suspected septicemia. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 9 patients: the patient with suspected meningitis was excluded from the clinical evaluation because the infection was doubtfully due to bacteria. Responses were excellent in 4 and good in 5 patients. No patient with a poor response was observed. All of the 6 etiological isolates obtained from 5 patients (2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis) were eradicated. 2. As for side effects, rash was observed in 1 patient and petechiae accompanied by decreases in platelets and reticulocytes and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in another. Other abnormal laboratory test values in addition to the above abnormalities consisted of an increase in GPT in 1 patient and increases in GOT and GPT in another. These side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were mild and normalized after discontinuation or completion of IPM/CS administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Activity of amikacin and ampicillin in succession and in combination.
AB  - One strain each of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis were exposed to amikacin and ampicillin in combination as well as in succession. Exposure to ampicillin for 1 hr followed by amikacin for 3 or 4 hr had the greatest antibacterial activity when the antibiotics were applied in succession. The least effective exposures for both organisms were 1 hr to amikacin followed by 3 or 4 hr to ampicillin. Exposure to the antibiotics in combination each at 1 MIC had the overall greatest antibacterial activity. Simultaneous exposure to the antibiotic combination does not necessarily mean simultaneous activity of both ampicillin and amikacin on the E. coli. The cell wall autolytic activities produced by ampicillin are triggered within 10 min after physical contact with the bacteria. In contrast, amikacin requires at least 30 min after physical contact to manifest its activity on the ribosome. Although physical exposure to both antibiotics in the combination is simultaneous, the specific activity of each is in fact sequential, with ampicillin acting first. This explains the synergistic effect of the combination. It appears, therefore, that the synergistic or antagonistic affect of a drug combination is determined by the sequence and timing of the antibacterial manifestations of its components.
TI  - Laboratory detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Methods for detection of high-level resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics were evaluated using 104 blood isolates of enterococci (97 Enterococcus faecalis and 7 Enterococcus faecium). Kanamycin was used to predict resistance to amikacin. Discrepancies between methods were resolved by time-kill studies. Four methods (MicroScan, macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion) for detecting resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were compared, using 51 consecutive strains. There were 13 gentamicin-resistant strains, all of which were detected by macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion. MicroScan detected 2 (15%) of the 13. Of the 18 streptomycin-resistant strains, 17 (93%) were detected by disk diffusion, 16 (89%) by microtiter, 9 (50%) by macrotube, and 6 (33%) by MicroScan. An additional 53 consecutive strains were examined only by disk diffusion and microtiter for resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. The entire population of 104 strains contained 35 gentamicin-, 22 streptomycin-, and 54 kanamycin-resistant enterococcal isolates. All 35 gentamicin-resistant strains were detected by both methods. Of the 22 streptomycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 19 by both methods. Of the 54 kanamycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 51 by both methods. One additional strain which was resistant only by disk diffusion was susceptible to amikacin plus penicillin by time-kill studies. Disk diffusion is a suitable method for detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in E. faecalis and is well suited for sporadic testing. Additional data are necessary to determine the suitability of these tests for E. faecium.

TI  - Microbiological investigation of an outbreak of bacteraemia due to Streptococcus  faecalis in an intensive care unit.
AB  - An increased incidence of bacteraemia due to Streptococcus faecalis in a Critical Care and Trauma Centre (CCTC) during November 1985 prompted investigation. During the epidemic 21 blood cultures from five CCTC patients were positive for S. faecalis. A point prevalence culture survey revealed two more strains from wounds from two of these five patients. Fifteen strains from blood cultures and the two strains from wound sites were further characterized by conventional biotyping methods and susceptibility patterns, but they could not be differentiated from 40 unrelated control strains by these methods. The API-20S and the API-ZYM systems, however, were able to distinguish the outbreak isolates from the control strains. This investigation supports the hypothesis that S. faecalis is capable of causing cross-infection, and it may be necessary to characterize enterococci beyond routine tests to identify an outbreak due to this organism.
TI  - Cloning and expression of genes encoding pheromone-inducible antigens of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis.
AB  - Fragments, generated by restriction enzyme digestion, of the 58-kilobase Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF10 were cloned and introduced into Escherichia coli and E. faecalis to characterize the pheromone-inducible conjugation system encoded by this plasmid. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses revealed that a 130-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, identical to the Tra130 antigen shown previously to be involved in pCF10-mediated pheromone-inducible surface exclusion, was produced by both bacterial hosts carrying the recombinant plasmid pINY1825 (cloned EcoRI C fragment). Both bacterial hosts carrying pINY1825 also produced various amounts of immunologically related 118- to 125-kDa antigens (designated pre-Tra130) that resembled antigens produced by E. faecalis cells carrying pCF10. An additional 150-kDa antigen, Tra150, probably involved in pheromone-induced cellular aggregation, was produced by Escherichia coli and E. faecalis hosts carrying pINY1801 (cloned EcoRI C and E fragments). The coding sequences for the Tra150 and Tra130 antigens were further localized in the TRA region of pCF10 by transposon insertion mutagenesis. Western blot analyses of the recombinant strains, and of strains carrying derivatives of pCF10 or various recombinant plasmids containing Tn5 or Tn917 insertions, suggested that the portion of pCF10 comprising the tra3 through -6 segments (previously defined by Tn917 insertional mutagenesis) contained several genes that are involved in regulating the synthesis of Tra130 and Tra150.
TI  - Structure of cCF10, a peptide sex pheromone which induces conjugative transfer of the Streptococcus faecalis tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCF10.
AB  - The peptide pheromone, cCF10, which induces aggregation and high frequency plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis cells carrying the tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCF10, was isolated and its structure determined. The molecular weight of cCF10 is 789, and its amino acid sequence is H-Leu-Val-Thr-Leu-Val-Phe-Val-OH. Pheromone activity, as determined by a clumping induction assay, was detectable at a concentration of 2.5 x 10(-11) M. A peptide of the same sequence as that of the cCF10 produced by S. faecalis cells was synthesized by the liquid-phase method. The synthetic pheromone showed biological activity and chromatographic behavior that was identical to that of the cCF10 of bacterial origin. When the response of S. faecalis cells to various concentrations of synthetic cCF10 was monitored by measuring both the frequency of plasmid transfer and the synthesis of pheromone-inducible antigens, an excellent correlation was observed between donor ability and the appearance of a 150-kilodalton protein that appears to be involved in formation of mating aggregates. The dose-response data in the range of concentrations where the amount of pheromone became limiting (10(-11)-10(-12) M) were consistent with the notion that as few as one or two molecules per donor cell may be sufficient to induce a mating response.
TI  - Active potassium extrusion regulated by intracellular pH in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Potassium extrusion in bacteria is thought to play a role in the regulation of the cytoplasmic pH; in several organisms, it has been ascribed to secondary antiport of K+ for protons. Streptococcus faecalis exhibited a distinctive pattern: potassium extrusion occurred only when the cytoplasmic pH was alkaline and required the generation of ATP. The key observation is that glycolyzing cells suspended in an alkaline medium extruded K+, even against a K+ concentration gradient, provided the medium contained a weak permeant base (e.g. diethanolamine or methylamine). The amines render the cytoplasmic pH alkaline; when conditions were arranged to keep the cytoplasm neutral, no K+ extrusion was seen. Potassium extrusion required the presence of either glucose or arginine and was unaffected by protonophores and by inhibition of the F1Fo-ATPase. When the medium contained [14C]methylamine, the cells accumulated the base to an extent stoichiometrically equivalent to the K+ lost. Concurrently, the cytoplasmic pH fell from 8.8 to 7.6, at which point K+ extrusion ceased. The results suggest that K+ extrusion is due to an ATP-driven transport system that expels K+ by exchange for H+ and is active only at alkaline cytoplasmic pH.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Histamine formation by enterococci isolated from home-made goat cheeses.
AB  - A survey was made of the histamine-producing capability of enterococci isolated from goat cheeses. The strains, 130 Streptococcus faecium and 106 S. faecalis, were grown in Trypticase Soy Broth Histidine medium (TSBH) at 35 degrees C for 24 h and the histamine formed was determined by fluorometry. Forty-one (31.5%) of the S. faecium strains and 2 (1.9%) of the S. faecalis strains produced histamine. The largest amount detected was 4.0 micrograms histamine/ml TSBH. Compared with the amounts of histamine produced by some Gram-negative bacteria, the histamine production by enterococci seems to be low. Under the present conditions the enterococci seem to have no relevance from a histamine intoxication point of view.
TI  - Chemotactic and chemokinetic activity of Streptococcus faecalis culture supernatant for equine neutrophils.
AB  - Although equine neutrophils did not respond towards formylated methionyl peptides, Streptococcus faecalis culture supernatant caused an in vitro stimulation of equine neutrophil motility when measured by an under-agarose assay. The migration of neutrophils towards the culture supernatant increased sigmoidally with the logarithmic concentration of the culture supernatant in the chemoattractant wells. The streptococcal culture supernatant was chemokinetic because it stimulated the random motility of the phagocytes. Because granulocytes migrated further towards the supernatant than could be explained by the chemokinetic activity of the bacterial products, the streptococcal culture fluid also exerted a chemotactic effect on the leukocytes. The chemotactic activity of the supernatant was further confirmed by the changes in the orientation of the migrating cells during incubation. These results indicate that bacteria produce cytotaxins other than formylmethionyl peptides which are recognized by equine neutrophils.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis susceptibility to amiloride depends on medium pH.
AB  - Amiloride is one of the major molecular probes in basic and applied investigations on the physiology of cation transport in animal cells. In these cells the drug also exerts growth inhibitory activity. Recently, we discovered that amiloride causes growth inhibition also on bacterial cells. In this paper we report that medium pH influences amiloride activity on Streptococcus faecalis. The lowering of external pH causes a drop in the susceptibility of this bacterium to amiloride up to an almost complete resistance. This finding, constitutes a novel aspect of the in vitro experimental pharmacology of this diuretic potentially useful also in clinical pharmacology and in animal cell investigations.
TI  - Evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pIP501 into strains of Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The conjugative broad host range plasmid pIP501 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. With these transconjugants as donors the plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of Strep. thermophilus. There was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of Lact. helveticus. Transfer from Lact. helveticus to Strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. There was no evidence for the conjugal transfer of plasmid pIP501 into a strain of Lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either lactic streptococci or Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Decrease of urine creatinine in vitro in spinal cord injury patients.
AB  - Freshly voided urine from 3 spinal cord injury (SCI) patients showed a progressive decline in creatinine concentration over 2 weeks while maintained in the refrigerator. Urine creatinine concentration remained stable in normals, patients with kidney disease and 9 other SCI patients. Mixtures of affected and normal urine showed a progressive decline in creatinine. Boiling or filtering prevented the decline while light centrifugation enhanced the decrease in the sediment but minimized it in the supernatant. Streptococcus fecalis was cultured from all 3 patients' urine, and produced a dramatic fall in creatinine concentration on incubation in broth with creatinine, as well as when added to normal urine. In the refrigerator, however, S. fecalis added to broth with creatinine, as well as to urine did not produce significant fall in creatinine concentration. Thus in certain SCI patients creatinine concentration decreases even when freshly obtained urine is maintained in the refrigerator. The cause of the fall in creatinine may relate to the presence of S. fecalis.

TI  - Laboratory evaluation of disposable and reusable disinfectant cloths for cleaning food contact surfaces.
AB  - A comparison of five methods of cleaning Formica surfaces contaminated with bacteria dried in milk has been carried out. A standardized procedure was developed, and impression plates were found to be at least as sensitive as a swab-rinse method for detecting bacteria on the surfaces. The most satisfactory results were obtained with one type of disposable alcohol-impregnated wipe and with a detergent/hypochlorite solution applied with paper. A reusable cloth impregnated with disinfectant initially performed well against all test organisms, but was less reliable against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, after the cloth had been used and rinsed several times. The importance of introducing methods to reduce the high risk of cross-contamination presently associated with the use of wiping cloths in catering premises is stressed.
TI  - High-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium.
AB  - During a 14-month period beginning in July 1986, three distinct clinical isolates of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium demonstrating high-level resistance (MIC, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were recovered from individual patients at one institution. Combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. By filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into Streptococcus faecalis JH2-7 occurred at lower frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). Aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (III) phosphorylating enzymes, AAC-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of S. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. All three isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. Curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. Loss of high-level gentamicin resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. Transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in S. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of S. faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.
TI  - Structural relationships between senfolomycins and paulomycins.
AB  - Senfolomycins A and B (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.-1965: 828-831, 1966) are two antibacterial agents with physico-chemical and biological properties similar to those of paulomycin. Recent studies indicate that senfolomycin A (C29H36N2O16S, MW 700) has molecular composition and fast atom bombardment MS fragmentation pattern identical to those of paulomycin E. Extensive NMR work indicates that the two antibiotics, which have been separated by HPLC and TLC, differ only in the stereochemistry of the OCH3 group present in their respective sugar moieties. Indirect evident suggests that senfolomycin B is dihydrosenfolomycin A (C29H38N2O16S, MW 702) and in this respect it is related to paulomycin F. The proposed structures for senfolomycins A and B are discussed.
TI  - Tn916 delta E: a Tn916 transposon derivative expressing erythromycin resistance.
AB  - The tetracycline resistance gene encoded within the transposon Tn916 was replaced with the gene encoding erythromycin resistance from the plasmid pVA838. The derivative transposon of Tn916 was designated Tn916 delta E and was introduced into the Streptococcus faecalis chromosome by protoplast transformation. The conjugation/transposition functions of Tn916 delta E were similar to those observed for Tn916 in S. faecalis and Tn916 delta E was capable of self-conjugation at frequencies similar to those of other S. faecalis and Group B Streptococcus. This transposon will be useful for mutagenesis studies in gram-positive organisms, especially in those species where erythromycin resistance is a more desirable selectable marker.
TI  - Regulation of the pAD1 sex pheromone response in Enterococcus faecalis: construction and characterization of lacZ transcriptional fusions in a key control region of the plasmid.
AB  - Strains carrying the Enterococcus (formerly Streptococcus) faecalis plasmid pAD1  responded to exogenous sex pheromone by inducing a number of gene products which facilitated mating. A 7-kilobase region of pAD1 was identified which contained genes that are important for the regulation of this response. Using the transposon Tn917-lac delivery vector pTV32Ts, we generated a number of fusions that allowed us to examine transcription in this region. At least three transcriptional units were identified by grouping fusions by their phenotype, direction of transcription, and response to pheromone. Transcription from one set of fusions was sensitive to the presence of pheromone. Analysis of the patterns of protein production previously shown to be induced in the presence of pheromone provided more information on the function of the genes of interest. We postulate the existence of two negative regulatory proteins that act coordinately to repress the pheromone response, one of which may be involved in sensing or transmitting the pheromone signal, and at least one positive regulatory protein whose synthesis is dependent on the presence of pheromone. In addition, the isolation of a relatively small deletion mutant capable of producing cAD1. the pheromone specific for pAD1-containing cells, indicates that a factor(s) that is important for the shutdown of endogenous pheromone is also present in this region.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a composite chromosomal conjugative element (Tn3701) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The plasmid-free Streptococcus pyogenes A454 contains a conjugative element, Tn3701, encoding resistance to erythromycin (Emr), tetracycline (Tcr), and minocycline (Mnr). We have mapped a 50-kilobase (kb) chromosomal region of A454 corresponding to the internal part of Tn3701. Tn3701 includes a 19.7-kb structure, designated Tn3703, on which the Emr Tcr Mnr determinants were localized. Tn3703 was very similar in structure to Tn916. Translocation of the Emr Tcr Mnr markers from A454 onto pIP964, an Enterococcus faecalis hemolysin plasmid, yielded different pIP964 derivatives. When the inserts of four of these derivatives were aligned with the 50-kb region of Tn3701, three of them were found to result from the transposition of Tn3703 and one resulted from the insertion of a 44.0-kb portion of Tn3701, including Tn3703. Tn3701 inserted, apparently without changing its structure, in the chromosomes of various streptococcal transconjugants, as well as in one of the 12 E. faecalis transconjugants studied. Tn3703 inserted at different chromosomal sites in four E. faecalis transconjugants, and one copy of Tn3701 plus an additional copy of Tn3703 were detected in the chromosomes of seven transconjugants.
TI  - Novel streptococcal mutants defective in the regulation of H+-ATPase biosynthesis and in F0 complex.
AB  - In Streptococcus faecalis (faecium), the cytoplasmic pH is regulated by proton extrusion via a proton translocating F1F0-ATPase; the level of this enzyme increases in response to cytoplasmic acidification (Kobayashi, H., Suzuki, T., and Unemoto, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 627-630). We describe here two novel acid-sensitive mutants, designated AS8 and AS17, that contain ATPase activity but fail to grow on acid media. Our data suggested that in mutant AS17, acidification of the cytoplasm stimulates synthesis of the F0 sector of the ATPase but not the F1 sector. The accumulation in the plasma membrane of F0 sectors devoid of F1 results in enhanced proton permeability, and as a consequence mutant AS17 is unable to regulate the cytoplasmic pH in acid media. The genetic defect may reside in a gene that regulates expression of the F1F0-ATPase. Mutant AS8 does not generate a proton motive force. Our results suggest that the F1F0-ATPase can hydrolyze ATP but fails to translocate protons due to a defect in one of the subunits of the F0 sector.
TI  - [Conjugation transfer of the plasmid pAMbeta1 into various Bacillus species].
AB  - Streptococcal broad host range plasmid pAM beta 1 was transferred by a conjugation-like process from Streptococcus faecalis to 13 strains of different Bacilli species. In intraspecies matings the frequencies of transfer of pAM beta 1 varied from 2.10(-5) to 1.10(-8). As it was shown by comparative analysis the frequency of transfer and stability of the maintainance of plasmid pAM beta 1 in Bacilli were not connected. Molecular weight and restriction pattern of pAM beta 1 DNA isolated from Bacilli were the same as those of pAM beta 1 DNA from Streptococcal donor strain.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-76,252 (CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - U-76,252 is the prodrug of U-76,253. MICs of U-76,253 were 0.015 to 0.06 microgram/ml for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis; 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml for Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter diversus; 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus spp.; and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila; for 72% of the latter group, MICs were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were greater than 16 micrograms/ml.

TI  - The antibacterial activity of a new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin.
AB  - The new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin, SPA-S-565, was shown to exert an effective antibacterial activity in vitro comparable to that of rifampicin. In fact, the antibacterial activity of SPA-S-565 against numerous Gram-positive cocci belonging to Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species as well as against 20 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was similar to that of rifampicin. In Swiss albino mice intraperitoneally infected with Staphylococcus aureus Oxford strain or Streptococcus pyogenes, the protective activity of SPA-S-565 and rifampicin was quite remarkable, and no significant difference was noted between the two antibiotics. In M. tuberculosis-infected mice treated with the antibacterial agents every seven days, the protection exerted by SPA-S-565 was significantly greater than that exerted by rifampicin.
TI  - Synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  - The in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by Bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with Neisseria gonorrhoea, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Str. faecalis. The in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the MICs with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. The MICs of metronidazole for B. melaninogenicus, B. fragilis and B. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. The in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. Combined therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of Bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. The synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.
TI  - Sequence analysis of termini of conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - Transposon Tn916 is a 16.4-kilobase, broad-host-range, conjugative transposon originally identified on the chromosome of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis DS16. Its termini have been sequenced along with the junction regions for two different insertions. The ends were found to contain imperfect inverted repeat sequences with identity at 20 of 26 nucleotides. Further in from the ends, imperfect directly repeated sequences were present, with 24 of 27 nucleotides matching. The transposon junction regions contained homologous segments but of a nature not consistent with a direct duplication of the target sequence. Within the right terminus was a potential outwardly reading promoter. Tn916 is believed to transpose via an excision-insertion mechanism; based on the analyses of the termini, as well as two target sequences (before insertion and after excision), a possible model is suggested.
TI  - Thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension during three types of gram-positive bacteremia in piglets.
AB  - Thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group B streptococcus (GBS), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. We postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as Streptococcus fecalis (ENT) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. We observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of GBS, Ent, and S. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). Pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous pO2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for Ent and S. epi. In 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, GBS: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm Hg/liter/min, Ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm Hg/liter/min, S. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm Hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane B2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, GBS: 30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, Ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, S. epi: 31 +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). This dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm Hg). The thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced TxB2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. We conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.
TI  - Daptomycin (LY146032) treatment of experimental enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - This study compared daptomycin (LY146032) with penicillin G procaine and vancomycin without and with gentamicin for treatment of experimental enterococcal endocarditis. The strain of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis used in this study was killed by daptomycin in vitro in broth but not in serum. In rabbits treated for 3 days, daptomycin significantly reduced bacterial counts of vegetations compared with no therapy but was significantly less effective than penicillin G procaine or vancomycin. Daptomycin-gentamicin significantly reduced bacterial counts of vegetations compared with daptomycin alone but was significantly less effective than vancomycin plus gentamicin. The efficacy of daptomycin-gentamicin did not differ significantly from that of penicillin G procaine-gentamicin. The lack of enterococcal killing by daptomycin alone in serum and in experimental endocarditis is probably related to the high protein binding of the agent.
TI  - Evidence for a single active-site cysteinyl residue in the streptococcal NADH peroxidase.
AB  - Substrate reduction of the streptococcal flavoprotein NADH peroxidase, followed by anaerobic denaturation and titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), yields a stoichiometry of one protein thiol per mole of FAD. Analysis of the NADH peroxidase, purified from cultures of Streptococcus faecalis 10Cl grown on a chemically-defined medium containing [35S]cysteine, confirms the stoichiometry of one cysteinyl residue per subunit and allows the isolation and sequencing of the corresponding cysteinyl peptide. The amino acid sequence of the single cysteinyl peptide thus identified shows a striking difference from the active-site cysteinyl peptides of the flavoprotein disulfide and dimercaptide reductases.

TI  - [The degree of DNA homology in enterococci].
AB  - Studies carried out by the method of DNA-DNA hybridization have confirmed that Enterococcus faecalis, S. faecium and S. durans are independent species. As revealed in these studies, S. faecalis are homogeneous, genetically related and form an independent, sharply defined species, while S. faecium form a heterogeneous species. Mobile enterococci with yellow pigmentation must not be classified with both S. faecalis and S. faecium.
TI  - [Post-antibiotic effect of ciprofloxacin alone and in combination on Streptococcus faecalis].
AB  - Post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ciprofloxacin has been studied on 2 strains of S. faecalis in the logarithmic phase after 2 exposure times and at concentrations ranging 0.5-10 times the MIC. At the end of the exposure period the antimicrobial is removed by dilution. Similar PAE is observed for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, higher than for pefloxacin. Ciprofloxacin-fosfomycin or ciprofloxacin-vancomycin combinations are indifferent or even antagonistic (vancomycin) in regards to PAE. Ciprofloxacin-penicillin or ciprofloxacin-netilmicin are weakly synergistic.

AB  - Killing curves method was used to study bactericidal activity of the three quinolones, alone and in combination with penicillin, amoxicillin, fosfomycin, netilmicin, vancomycin against six isolates of enterococci. Alone, ofloxacin showed the most initial bactericidal effect but ciprofloxacin was the most frequently bactericidal without any regrowth in 24 hours. The combinations with beta-lactams and netilmicin were sometimes synergistic in 24 hours; fosfomycin increased initial bactericidal effect.
TI  - Renal pharmacokinetic changes of gentamicin during enterococcal pyelonephritis.
AB  - In the present study, the renal pharmacokinetics of gentamicin was investigated in pyelonephritic rats infected with Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. Four days after the induction of infection, animals were given either a single dose of gentamicin or two daily injections for 7 days. The treated animals were evaluated from 1 h to 6 months posttreatment. After a single injection, limited pharmacokinetic variations were observed, whereas after 14 injections infected kidneys demonstrated significantly higher concentrations and a more extended renal elimination phase of the antibiotic. Analysis of the area under the curve of the concentration in kidney versus time showed more marked renal accumulation by the infected and long-term treated animals than by normal animals or those receiving only one injection of aminoglycoside. Renal function remained normal in both the infected and normal animals treated with this aminoglycoside. These results demonstrate that S. faecalis pyelonephritis disturbs the renal handling of gentamicin and may increase the susceptibility of the kidney to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - The response of Streptococcus faecalis to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin.
AB  - The response to three quinolones of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus faecalis  was studied by continuous turbidimetric monitoring, by viable counting, and in an in-vitro model of the treatment of bacterial cystitis. Dense populations (c. 8 x 10(6) cfu/ml) responded to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin at concentrations below the conventionally determined MIC, but variants, shown to exhibit decreased susceptibility, emerged during overnight incubation. The variants were cross-resistant to each of the three quinolones, but the resistance was lost on subculture in drug-free broth. At a concentration of ten-fold MIC, ciprofloxacin was more bactericidal than norfloxacin or enoxacin. In experiments in the bladder model, doses of ciprofloxacin achieving a peak concentration of 10, 50 or 250 mg/l suppressed bacterial growth for 20 h or more. The doses of norfloxacin or enoxacin required to achieve a comparable effect were higher than those of ciprofloxacin. A reduction in susceptibility, as judged by comparative disc testing, occurred after two cycles of exposure to norfloxacin or enoxacin in experiments in which the peak concentration achieved was 50 mg/l, but not when the peak was 250 mg/l. Reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin developed only in experiments in which a lower peak concentration of 10 mg/l was achieved.
TI  - Synergistic effect of ampicillin or vancomycin in combination with decreasing concentrations of streptomycin against enterococci.
AB  - The extent of synergistic killing and duration of the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was evaluated in streptomycin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium with 20 mcg/ml of ampicillin or 10 mcg/ml of vancomycin in combination with decreasing concentrations of streptomycin (20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5 mcg/ml). The bactericidal activity or duration in recovery period declined progressively in a linear pattern with decreasing concentrations of streptomycin. One log10 or greater reduction in viable counts was seen with streptomycin concentrations of 2 mcg/ml or higher with both ampicillin and vancomycin. A synergistic increase in recovery period (PAE greater than or equal to 0.5 h) of ampicillin or vancomycin was observed with concentrations of streptomycin in excess of 2 mcg/ml and 1 mcg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that lower dosage of streptomycin in the therapy of enterococcal infections will probably result in a higher relapse rate.
TI  - [Efficacy of teicoplanin in 25 cases of severe infections caused by gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 25 severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria alone [13], in combination [9], alone then in combination [3], in an open study. Of 22 infections that could be evaluated, there were 18 cures and improvements (81.8%), 2 recurrence and 2 failures. Serum concentrations are unpredictable and steady after 5 days i.v. teicoplanin. Trough and peak concentrations are respectively less than 5 mg/l and less than 20 mg/l in 13 infections and higher in 9, unrelated with success or failure. A trough concentration greater than CMI and kind of infection seem deciding. The choice of the antibiotic combined with teicoplanin warrant more data.
TI  - Inter- and intrageneric transfer of Tn916 between Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium tetani.
AB  - We report that the streptococcal resistance transposon, Tn916, is conjugally transferred to Clostridium tetani (Utrecht) in intergenic matings. Streptococcus faecalis CG180, harboring a 41-kb plasmid (pAM180) containing Tn916 (15 kb), transferred the transposon-associated tetracycline resistance (Tcr) to C. tetani in filter matings at a frequency of about 10(-4)/donor. An erythromycin resistance marker carried by pAM180 was not transferred, indicating lack of plasmid conjugation or stable inheritance of plasmid sequences. DNA extracted from C. tetani transconjugants was probed with radiolabeled Tn916 using Southern blot analysis and these results indicated that the transposon integrated at multiple host genomic sites. Tn916-carrying C. tetani strains were able to transfer Tcr to suitable recipient strains of C. tetani as well as to S. faecalis recipients. These results indicate that this transposon is able to be disseminated and expressed in obligately anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, this system opens avenues for the implementation of transposon mutagenesis in this important pathogenic species.
TI  - [Demonstration of an inoculum effect on the estimation of the minimal inhibitory  concentration of LY 146032].
AB  - This work has been performed to study the inoculum effect on the in vitro activity of LY 146032, a new lipopeptide antibiotic. A statistical analysis (X2 and t test) of the data concerning the MIC of different bacterial groups has been carried out to appreciate the phenomenon. The activity of vancomycin has been compared. A major inoculum effect has been detected for LY 146032. It must be taken into account to evaluate the activity of this new antibiotic.
TI  - Restriction mapping and hybridization studies of a beta-lactamase-encoding fragment from Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis.
AB  - A restriction map of a 5.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment encoding an enterococcal beta-lactamase was prepared and compared with the restriction map of a cloned staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene and with the published maps of several other staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes. Comparison and hybridization studies showed that there were identical restriction sites in the region of the bla structural gene but not in the region surrounding this gene.
TI  - Interaction of ciprofloxacin with ampicillin and vancomycin for Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis is known to be resistant to killing by many of the commonly used antimicrobial agents. Ciprofloxacin, a member of the quinolone class of compounds, was studied for its ability to inhibit and to kill S. faecalis. The rate of killing by ciprofloxacin was slow and was comparable to that of ampicillin or vancomycin. The antimicrobial effect of combining ciprofloxacin with ampicillin or with vancomycin was also studied using checkerboard double-dilution and killing kinetics. There was no synergy or antagonism between ciprofloxacin and either cell wall active agent. Unlike the aminoglycosides, the addition of ciprofloxacin did not produce additional killing over that of ampicillin or of vancomycin alone.
TI  - Resistance patterns of important gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci are among the most important Gram-positive organisms responsible for serious infections in hospitals as well as in the community. We report here the resistance patterns encountered in these species at St Joseph and Broussais Hospitals in Paris.
TI  - Plasmids and pheromone response of the beta-lactamase producer Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis HH22.
AB  - Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis HH22 is a clinical isolate that produces beta-lactamase and is resistant to various other antimicrobial agents. In this study, HH22 was found to contain three conjugative plasmids and a conjugative transposon. pBEM10 encodes beta-lactamase, gentamicin resistance, and a response to the peptide pheromone cAD1; pAM323 encodes erythromycin resistance; and pAM324 encodes no known resistance. The latter two plasmids respond to pheromones designated cAM323 and cAM324 which are unrelated to other previously characterized pheromones. pBEM10 and pAM323 are the second and third examples of naturally occurring R plasmids that confer a sex pheromone response.
TI  - Evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to Escherichia coli.
AB  - High-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type B (MLS) antibiotics in Escherichia coli BM2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative plasmid pIP1527 of the MLS resistance determinant ermBC, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pAM77 from Streptococcus sanguis (ermAM) and in transposon Tn917 from Enterococcus faecalis (ermB). This gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence IS1. The 23S rRNA methylase encoded by pIP1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by Tn917 and pAM77, respectively. Unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible MLS phenotype, the ermBC gene is expressed constitutively in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. Transcription of the ermBC gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both E. coli and B. subtilis. Promoters P2 and P3 are located within the region homologous to pAM77 and Tn917, and P1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of IS15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. These results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from Streptococcus spp. to E. coli. This transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as Tn917 or Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an MLS determinant that is homologous to ermB. We speculate that the insertion sequences IS15 and IS1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermBC, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.
TI  - [Effects of ceftriaxone on infections during the perinatal period].
AB  - Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was studied for its efficacy and safety in 8 cases of infection during the perinatal period; 6 before, and 2 after delivery. The results obtained are recognized as follows: 1. CTRX was administered by intravenous drip infusion at a daily dose between 2 and 4 g for 2 to 10 days (a total dose: 4 to 20 g) each of 8 cases of infections during the perinatal period; 3 of amniotic fluid infection and 1 each of intrauterine infection, puerperal fever, puerperal wound infection, appendicitis and pyelonephritis. CTRX was evaluated to be very effective in 3, effective in 3 and ineffective in 2, with an efficacy rate of 75% (6/8). 2. Two strains of Enterococcus faecalis and 1 each of Pseudomonas cepacia and Streptococcus intermedius were isolated. All of them were eradicated by the CTRX treatment bacteriologically. 3. No adverse reactions were observed subjectively or objectively. A slight transient elevation of GOT, GPT and Al-P was observed in 1 case. No abnormal sign was observed in neonates.

AB  
TI  - Microbial spoilage of pre-cooked potato-topped pies.
AB  - The ecological succession of bacteria which developed in pre-cooked potato-topped pies stored at two different temperatures was examined. Bacillus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus-Micrococcus spp. were the predominant organisms isolated from freshly prepared pies and those stored at 4 degrees and 37 degrees C. None of these groups of bacteria caused significant biodeterioration of pies held at 4 degrees C, but all groups grew well in pies stored at 37 degrees C and achieved counts of ca 10(8)/g of sample. Bacillus spp. were the first group to grow, followed by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus-Micrococcus spp. Growth which occurred at 37 degrees C did so at the expense of glucose, lactate accumulated and the pH of pie components decreased. Amylase activity detected in all pie components during storage was associated with the growth of Bacillus spp. and probably supplemented glucose already present in pies, by hydrolytic cleavage of potato, flour or binder starches. Spoilage caused by growth and activity of the bacteria isolated was not associated with visual signs of biodeterioration, nor production of 'off' odour usually associated with spoilage of meats. These results suggest that pre-cooked potato-topped pies held at inappropriate temperatures represent a potential public health risk.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of group B streptococcal plasmids and comobilization of Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids to Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The antibiotic resistance group B streptococcal plasmids, pIP501 and pVA797, were conjugally transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to Lactobacillus plantarum. The Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids, pVA838 and pSA3, were mobilized from S. sanguis to L. plantarum by pVA797 via cointegrate formation. pVA838 readily resolved from pVA797 and was present in L. plantarum as deletion derivatives. The pVA797::pSA3 cointegrate failed to resolve in L. plantarum.
TI  - Introduction of the Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn916 into Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis.
AB  - The conjugative Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn916 was introduced into Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis by filter matings with S. faecalis. B. thuringiensis transconjugants resistant to tetracycline (Tetr) were detected at a frequency of approximately 7.0 X 10(-7) per recipient cell during filter matings, whereas transfer of Tn916 was not observed in broth matings. The Tetr phenotype in subsp. israelensis was stable in the absence of antibiotic selection. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that Tn916 had inserted into several different sites on the B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis chromosome but insertion into plasmid DNA was not observed. Movement of Tn916 was demonstrated when Tetr B. thuringiensis transconjugants were mated with isogenic recipients. Southern hybridizations, however, showed that the resulting Tetr isolates contained Tn916 junction fragments that were nearly identical to the donor, suggesting that this movement resulted from transfer of chromosomal DNA from donor to recipient or from a fusion of mating cells, rather than conjugative transposition of the Tn element.
TI  - Impact of LY146032 on Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis translocation in mice.
AB  - The susceptibility of Swiss White mice to colonization with Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis was greatly increased when the animals were given 5 mg of streptomycin sulfate per ml in their drinking water. One week after initiation of streptomycin treatment, the mice were challenged orogastrically with graded doses of streptomycin-resistant S. faecalis. The number of S. faecalis cells required to implant the intestinal tract of 50% of untreated mice was 2.9 X 10(9), but was only 4.8 X 10(3) for streptomycin-treated animals. When both groups of mice were challenged orogastrically with 4.6 X 10(6) viable S. faecalis cells, the cecum and small intestine of 100% of the streptomycin-treated animals, but only 10% of the untreated animals, were colonized with the organism. Similarly, translocation of S. faecalis to extraintestinal sites occurred in a majority of streptomycin-treated mice, but in only a small number of untreated mice. Subcutaneous administration of the experimental antibiotic LY146032 (Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, Ind.) to streptomycin-treated mice concomitant with orogastric challenge with 5.5 X 10(5) viable S. faecalis cells resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of intestinal colonization by the organism, a significant reduction in S. faecalis populations, and the absence of the organism in the liver, spleen, and heart. However, once intestinal colonization had occurred and extraintestinal infections were established, LY146032 did not significantly reduce S. faecalis populations or ameliorate the infections. We conclude that LY146032 effectively prevents translocation of S. faecalis from the intestinal tract of mice but does not resolve established extraintestinal infections.
TI  - Expression of the hemolysin trait in a proteolytic transconjugant of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis 31H-1 is a proteolytic transconjugant of strain 31B, that  harbors the 38.5 Mdal plasmid which codes for hemolysin in strain X14. It fails to express the hemolytic character in broth due to its proteolytic character. Hemolytic activity can be demonstrated when the proteolytic activity is inhibited by 10(-4) M EDTA. The effect of erythromycin (on the donor cells) and of proteinase K during conjugation suggests that the conjugation system involving the 38.5 Mdal plasmid of S. faecalis strain X14 is sex-pherormone mediated.
TI  - Acute bacterial endocarditis on a normal aortic valve following vaginal delivery.
AB  - We present a case of post-partum bacterial endocarditis on a normal aortic valve. Infection occurred following vaginal delivery. This complication, due to group D Streptococcus faecalis, has not been previously described in this context.
TI  - Kinetic mechanism and nucleotide specificity of NADH peroxidase.
AB  - NADH peroxidase is a flavoprotein isolated from Streptococcus faecalis which catalyzes the pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. Initial velocity, product, and dead-end inhibition studies have been performed at pH 7.5 and support a ping-pong kinetic mechanism. In the absence of hydrogen peroxide, both transhydrogenation between NADH and thioNAD, and isotope exchange between [14C]NADH and NAD, have been demonstrated, although in both these experiments, the maximal velocity of nucleotide exchange was less than 1.5% the maximal velocity of the peroxidatic reaction. We propose that NADH binds tightly to both oxidized and two-electron reduced enzyme. NADH oxidation proceeds stereospecifically with the transfer of the 4S hydrogen to enzyme, and then, via exchange, to water. No primary tritium kinetic isotope effect was observed, and no statistically significant primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on V/K were determined, although primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on V were observed in the presence and absence of sodium acetate. NADH peroxidase thus shares with other flavoprotein reductases striking kinetic, spectroscopic, and stereochemical similarities. On this basis, we propose a chemical mechanism for the peroxide cleaving reaction catalyzed by NADH peroxidase which involves the obligate formation of a flavinperoxide, and peroxo bond cleavage by nucleophilic attack by enzymatic dithiols.
TI  - Difficult streptococci.
AB  - Streptococci pose difficulties in laboratory and clinical diagnosis and in therapy. They are important pathogens with both potential for high mortality in acute infections and endocarditis, and recurrence and persistence in foreign-body associated infections. Prevention of serious infection and spread of infection pose a number of hospital problems but hospital difficulties may originate in community wide outbreaks which also require investigation and control. Our experience with septicaemia caused by Lancefield Group A streptococci, and with Group D streptococcal bacteraemia in liver transplant recipients are reported and both national and international problems with antibiotic resistant streptococci are reviewed.
TI  - Intergeneric and intrageneric conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance determinants in Leuconostoc spp.
AB  - Transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from Streptococcus faecalis to Leuconostoc dextranicum and Leuconostoc cremoris occurred between cells that were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of DNase. Transfer of pIP501 to Leuconostoc spp. also occurred when Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus lactis were used as donors. In addition, transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 was observed from L. cremoris and L. dextranicum transconjugants to S. sanguis and S. faecalis. Expression of the pAM beta 1 erythromycin and pIP501 erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was essentially equivalent in donors and transconjugants. Frequencies of transfer generally ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. Intrageneric transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 occurred between L. cremoris and L. dextranicum strains in the same approximate range. These data further extend the host range of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 and demonstrate another example of gene transfer in the genus Leuconostoc.
TI  - Susceptibilities of streptococcal strains associated with infective endocarditis  to nine antibiotics.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 121 streptococcal strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis to mezlocillin, piperacillin, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were determined by the agar dilution technique. Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to imipenem, mezlocillin and piperacillin. All the strains, except E. faecalis were sensitive to ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and ceftazidime and resistant to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin. E. faecalis strains were moderately resistant to the new quinolons.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections of the urinary tract in urology patients].
AB  - Researches effected in different nations have revealed that 5-12% of all hospitalized patients was affected with a nosocomial infection and that almost 1/3 of these were urinary tract infections. The hospitalized urological patients have a considerable proneness to contract a nosocomial urinary tract infection, because they are subjected to transurethral or suprapubic bladder catheterisms, to transurethral surgery and to the endoscopies, that are promoting maneuvers the urinary tract infections. Generally the Gram negative bacilli are the cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, even if lately Gram positive bacilli (especially Streptococcus Faecalis or Enterococcus), "Gram negative Facultative pathogens" (Klebsiella, Providencia, Citrobacter, Serratia) and Fungi are very important. Considering the importance of these infections we have examined the incidence of the urinary tract infections of the hospitalized patients between January 1, 1986 and December 31, 1986 in our Urologic Institute. During the 12-month study interval there were 450 hospital admissions, and 45 patients were affected with a nosocomial urinary tract infection (10%). The females were affected at the rate of 6.7% of them, with an incidence of 4.7% among all patients with a positive urine culture; on the contrary the males were affected at the rate of 11.4% of them, equal to 19.0% of patients with a positive urine culture. We have noticed that among the responsible microorganisms for the nosocomial urinary tract infections, the group of the "Gram negative Facultative pathogens" was more frequent (40%), followed by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Candida species. So also in our Urologic Institute the modification of the responsible agents for the nosocomial urinary tract infections happened. The nosocomial infections after the discovery of the antibiotics were considered wiped out, on the contrary these infections are still an important problem of public health, so that efficaciously must be tackled.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Bactericidal effect and regrowth of Streptococcus faecalis exposed to amoxicillin following beta-lactamase.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis usually requires high concentrations of penicillin or ampicillin to achieve killing (i.e. a high MBC/MIC ratio). However, most strains show the Eagle or paradoxical effect. We subjected 12 strains of S. faecalis to 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 micrograms/ml of amoxicillin. Turbidometry studies have shown that 3 h after the inactivation of amoxicillin by penicillinase, there was a longer effect for 1 micrograms/ml following beta-lactamase (12 h 31 min +/- 2 h 09 min) than for 10 micrograms/ml (7 h 0 min +/- 1 h 12 min) or 100 micrograms/ml (5 h 22 min +/- 0 h 52 min). After 3 h, the reduction of CFU/ml (inoculum 10(6) CFU/ml) was -1.8 +/- 0.6 for 1 micrograms/ml, -0.56 +/- 0.56 for 10 micrograms/ml and -0.21 +/- 0.20 for 100 micrograms/ml. The more rapid killing at 3 h was not the only reason for the longer effect following beta-lactamase observed with 1 micrograms/ml. Indeed, the growth curve obtained with an inoculum of 10(3) CFU/ml was 2 h delayed from the control curve (10(6) CFU/ml). In conclusion, a paradoxical effect (killing curves and effect following beta-lactamase) was observed for all S. faecalis strains included in this series.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - Comparative killing activity and postantibiotic effect of streptomycin combined with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin or vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Nine strains of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium were studied with respect to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin, vancomycin and streptomycin. Two strains were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to streptomycin. Evaluation and comparison of the killing activity with killing curves, and duration of the postantibiotic effect (PAE) after exposure for 1 h with regrowth curves was done with combinations of antibiotics or alone. The overall killing effect of ciprofloxacin with streptomycin was antagonistic, whereas synergism (greater than or equal to one log10 decrease in viable counts) was observed in streptomycin-susceptible strains with combinations of streptomycin and ampicillin, imipenem, piperacillin or vancomycin. In addition, prolongation of PAE (greater than or equal to 0.5 h) was seen only in streptomycin-susceptible strains. Thus, seven (100%) strains showed a synergistic increase in PAE to combinations with ampicillin and vancomycin, three (43%) to imipenem, four (57%) to piperacillin, but none to the combination of streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. A significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of increased killing and the extent of increase in recovery period with combinations of streptomycin with either ampicillin or vancomycin.
TI  - Impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - The aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. The parameters were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and serum concentrations. There were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. In the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. In the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. Serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/L for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. Ceftriaxone had a pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: Streptococcus faecium and Candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. Under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of Candida spp. was not influenced. Growth of Escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. Overgrowth of Candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. The results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of Candida. Cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. The observed overgrowth of Candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. This applies especially to immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Establishment of a typing system for group D streptococci.
AB  - Group D streptococci (n = 971, 4037 samples, 139 patients) were isolated from two intensive care units. Differentiation and typing revealed 6 species, 25 phage types, and 85 enterococcinotypes. Distribution of species showed strong differences especially concerning Enterococcus faecium which was rarely isolated from extraintestinal sites (5.9%). Phage typing was species specific and discriminated Enterococcus faecalis (n = 703 typable isolates, 19 phage types) and the other group D streptococci (n = 63 typable isolates, 6 phage types). Based on the production of enterococcines (15 indicator strains used) the isolates could be classified into 6 groups, one of which was further subdivided into 3 subgroups. Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens (n = 618), phage type V6b (n = 596), and enterococcine group IVc (n = 568) were most common. The combined use of markers resulted in 187 combinations, which demonstrated the valuable properties of the system.
TI  - Characterization of the 1-phosphohistidinyl residue in the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The phosphocarrier protein HPr of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system contains 1-phosphohistidine at residue 15. This residue and the active site residue Arg-17 are conserved in HPrs isolated from both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The pH- and temperature-dependent hydrolysis of the 1-phosphohistidinyl residue in P-HPr from Streptococcus faecalis has been investigated. The results show that the hydrolysis properties are very similar to those previously reported for P-HPr from Escherichia coli. It was postulated that the unusual hydrolysis properties were due to the presence of a carboxyl group at the active site, and it is now known that in HPr from Escherichia coli the C-terminal residue Glu-85 is present. The results in this paper suggest that a similar carboxyl group is present at the active site in HPr from Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Comparison of 1% silver sulfadiazine with and without 1% chlorhexidine digluconate for topical antibacterial effect in the burnt infected rat.
AB  - The addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (CDSS) was compared with 1% silver sulfadiazine (SS) alone to assess the antibacterial effect of a once-daily application of the therapies on an experimental rat model with a 20% full-thickness burn wound seeded with 10(8) microorganisms originally isolated from infected wounds of burn patients. Separate series evaluated Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Streptococcus faecalis. The mean concentration of all four organisms recovered after one week from biopsy specimens of full-thickness eschar was less in the CDSS-treated animals compared with the SS-treated animals. Microbial invasion into subjacent muscle was less frequent in animals seeded with S faecalis, while the mean concentration of bacteria recovered from muscle of animals seeded with S aureus and E cloacae was less in animals treated with CDSS compared with those treated with SS (P less than 0.05). The addition of 1% chlorhexidine digluconate to 1% silver sulfadiazine increased the antibacterial effectiveness of the latter agent.
TI  - A shift from acute to chronic spontaneous pyelonephritis in male MM mice associated with a change in the causal micro-organisms.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis was the predominant cause of acute diabetes-associated pyelonephritis occurring spontaneously in male MM mice until they were segregated in a new environment. Thereafter Pasteurella pneumotropica and Streptococcus faecalis emerged collectively as the most common causal organisms, the pyelonephritis became more chronic and Proteus mirabilis isolates from faeces and urine produced atypical non-swarming colonies on blood agar plates. This did not account for the reduced pathogenicity of Proteus mirabilis; when MM males were returned to the original environment the pyelonephritis again became acute but was associated with the atypical type of Proteus mirabilis although the normal type was abundant in the environment. The MM mice were Caesarean-derived and cross-fostered shortly before their transfer to the second environment, which probably accounts for their changed microbial status, but the reason for the emergence of the atypical type of Proteus mirabilis is not understood. The acute nature of the male MM pyelonephritis when caused by Proteus mirabilis parallels the situation described in other animals and humans.
TI  - The effect of growth-promoting antibiotics on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  - Small groups of chickens were given feed containing either avoparcin, nitrovin, virginiamycin or zinc bacitracin from the day of their purchase as day-olds. Differences between the birds receiving growth promoters and the untreated controls were observed during the last third of the 23 d survey period. The enterococcal population of the 'dosed' birds contained a greater proportion of Enterococcus faecium than did that of the control birds while the converse was true for Ent. gallinarum. This apparent selection of Ent. faecium by the growth-promoting antibiotics had an influence on the incidence of resistance to therapeutic antibiotics among the enterococcal population as a whole. This was because this species was generally more resistant than Ent. gallinarum to cephalothin, the MLS antibiotics (erythromycin, lincomycin and tylosin) and tetracycline.
TI  - Contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  - Protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. Comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. Thimerosal, iodoacetate, EDTA and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by bacteria in the large gut. These results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. Studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of Bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. Extracellular proteases were formed by Streptococcus faecalis ST6, Propionibacterium acnes P6, Clostridium perfringens C16, Cl. bifermentans C21 and Cl. sporogenes C25. Inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.
TI  - Characterization and comparison of two penicillinase-producing strains of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis.
AB  - We identified two beta-lactamase-positive enterococci. One strain was high-level  (MIC, greater than 2,000 microgram/ml) gentamicin resistant; the other was not (MIC, 12.5 microgram/ml). beta-Lactamase production was extrachromosomally mediated in both strains, and both strains showed an inoculum effect reversed by beta-lactamase inhibitors. The strain lacking high-level gentamicin resistance showed synergistic killing with a combination of penicillin, clavulanic acid, and gentamicin.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus faecalis on the growth of Bacteroides species and anaerobic cocci in mixed infection.
AB  - The relationship between Streptococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteria was studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Included in the study were one strain of S. faecalis, three strains each of the Bacteroides fragilis group and B. melaninogenicus group, and five strains of anaerobic cocci. The relationship between the organisms was studied by determining the individual change in colony-forming units (CFUs) of the two bacterial components that induces abscesses in mice, compared to the CFUs of each of the isolated when inoculated alone. Of the eleven combinations, the CFUs of S. faecalis increased in seven and decreased in two. The CFUs of anaerobic bacteria were never increased and were decreased in two. A mutual decrease in growth occurred only in the combinations of S. faecalis and B. melaninogenicus group. This study demonstrates the potential for pathogenicity of S. faecalis in mixed infections with the B. fragilis group and anaerobic cocci.
TI  - Open study of teicoplanin in gram-positive infections.
AB  - Eighteen patients with documented Gram-positive infections which included osteomyelitis, prosthetic infections, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infections were treated with teicoplanin. The organisms involved included Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates of which six were methicillin-resistant-MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (two), Streptococcus faecalis (one) and Streptococcus milleri (one). Clinical success occurred in all seven patients with skin and soft tissue Streptococcus milleri (one). Clinical success occurred in all seven patients with skin and soft tissue infections (with bacterial persistence in three out of the seven), in three patients with bacteraemia endocarditis, and in one of the three patients with chronic osteomyelitis. In four patients with prosthetic bone and joint infections, clinical improvement followed removal of prostheses. Adverse effects occurred in two patients and these included one patient with a rise in serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin and one patient with a rise in blood urea, both of which returned to within normal limits on discontinuing the drug. The study showed that teicoplanin is a safe and effective antistaphylococcal agent.
TI  - Use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a recently introduced glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used, in combination with other antibiotics, to treat 31 episodes of septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms. Teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many Gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. A single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. Of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with Hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. One death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment following febrile reaction. Eleven episodes were cured. Six episodes of Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. The remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including Streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.
TI  - Measurement of active constitutive L-pyrrolidonyl-peptidase from the genera Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - In the family Streptococceae the ability to measure L-pyrrolidonyl-peptidase is limited to Lancefield group D Enterococcus and group A Streptococcus pyogenes. A number of methods exist to assay this enzyme. All measure pyrrolidonyl-peptidase by the ability of the bacterium to cleave L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide to form free beta-naphthylamine and L-pyrrolidone-carboxylic acid. Free beta-naphthylamine is then reacted with N,N-dimethylamino-cinnamaldehyde to form a red color complex. These methods are generally expensive and require a 2-4 h incubation period before results are available. A method, which employs the substrate dried on paper discs and can be easily made, is described herein. It is simple to perform, inexpensive, rapid, and has a long storage life. The results of this constitutive method are equivalent to those obtained using a commercial system.
TI  - Purification of the ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  
TI  - LY146032, alone and in combination with gentamicin, for the treatment of enterococcal pyelonephritis in the rat model.
AB  - The in vivo and in vitro activity of LY146032 against Streptococcus faecalis GK was examined. The following MICs and MBCs in micrograms per milliliter were obtained: ampicillin, 0.8 and 1.5; vancomycin, 0.8 and 50; gentamicin, 12 and 25; and LY146032, 0.8 and 6. A time-kill-curve study involving approximately 10(6) organisms per ml showed a drop in the number of organisms of almost 2 log10 in the tube containing LY146032 (2 micrograms/ml) plus gentamicin (4 micrograms/ml) compared with bacterial numbers for the control at 4 h of incubation. However, regrowth was observed at 24 and 48 h, and no in vitro synergism was observed with the combination. A sample (1 ml) of overnight growth of this enterococcal strain at a concentration of 10(7) was then injected intravenously into 184 male Wistar rats weighing about 100 g each. After 12 days, 10 rats were sacrificed and the remaining ones were randomized into four treatment groups: (i) untreated control, (ii) LY146032 (3 mg) given subcutaneously, (iii) gentamicin (0.8 mg) given intramuscularly, and (iv) LY146032 plus gentamicin at the same dosages as when the drugs were used singly. The rats received antibiotics for 4 weeks twice daily, and approximately 10 rats in each group were sacrificed for quantitative kidney cultures at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the start of therapy. At the end of the 4- and 6-week periods, significantly better results were obtained with the combination of LY146032 plus gentamicin than with no treatment or treatment with single antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro selection of bacteria resistant to LY146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to LY146032. Exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of LY146032 resulted in MICs 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. After three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high MICs were maintained for the coagulase-negative staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with S. pneumoniae (1.2 X 10(-6) at 16 times the original MIC) and lowest with S. aureus (7.0 X 10(-10) at 8 times the original MIC). For bacteria For bacteria surviving time-kill studies MICs were also higher than were those for the original isolates. Exposure to LY146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. However, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.
TI  - Genetic organization of the bacterial conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - Tn916, which encodes resistance to tetracycline, is a 16.4-kilobase conjugative transposon originally identified on the chromosome of Streptococcus faecalis DS16. The transposon has been cloned in Escherichia coli on plasmid vectors, where it expresses tetracycline resistance; it can be reintroduced into S. faecalis via protoplast transformation. We have used a lambda::Tn5 bacteriophage delivery system to introduce Tn5 into numerous sites within Tn916. The Tn5 insertions had various effects on the behavior of Tn916. Some insertions eliminated conjugative transposition but not intracellular transposition, and others eliminated an excision step believed to be essential for both types of transposition. A few inserts had no effect on transposon behavior. Functions were mapped to specific regions on the transposon.
TI  - Transposon Tn916 mutagenesis in Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Mutagenesis of Bacillus anthracis by the streptococcal tetracycline resistance transposon Tn916 is described. Tn916 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis DS16C1 to B. anthracis VNR-1 by conjugation in a standard filter mating procedure. Tetracycline-resistant (Tcr) transconjugants were obtained at a frequency of 1.6 X 10(-8) per donor CFU. When donor and recipient cells were treated with nafcillin before conjugation, the frequency was increased nearly 10-fold. Nafcillin pretreatment of donor and recipient strains was used in all subsequent conjugation experiments. S.faecalis CG110, containing multiple chromosomal insertions of Tn916, transferred the transposon to B. anthracis VNR-1 at a frequency of 9.3 x 10(-5). A Tcr B. anthracis transconjugant, strain VNR-1-tet-1, transferred Tn916 to B. anthracis UM23-1 and Bacillus subtilis BST1 at frequencies of 2.1 x 10(-4) and 5.8 X 10(-6), respectively. The transfer of Tn916 occurred only on membrane filters, since no Tcr transconjugants were obtained when strains VNR-1-tet-1 and UM23-1 were mixed and incubated in broth culture. The presence of the Tn916-associated tetM gene in Tcr B. anthracis and B. subtilis transconjugants was confirmed in hybridization experiments by using a 5-kilobase-pair DNA fragment containing the tetM gene as a probe. Of 3,000 B. anthracis UM23-1 Tcr transconjugants tested, 21 were phenylalanine auxotrophs and 2 were auxotrophic for phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.
TI  - Extrachromosomal control of antibiotic resistance, DNase activity and enterotoxin production in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  
TI  - Prior experience and response of chickens to a streptococcal infection.
AB  - Streptococcus fecalis infection was diagnosed in a population of individually caged meat-type pullets. A retrospective analysis showed that the infection occurred in pullets fed ad libitum and not in those whose feed intake was restricted. Among the former, resistance as measured by changes in body weight and blood heterophils and lymphocytes was greater for those from which blood samples had been obtained than from those which had not been bled. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that handling and feeding programs can modify an individual's resistance to infectious agents. Moreover, these experiences do not have to be extreme; rather they may be consistent with routine production practices such as restricted feed intake and removal of blood for serological testing.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). II. Background of patients].
AB  - We have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes, age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. As for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. By contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. There were no noticeable changes according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. Thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. In 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were Gram-positive organisms. When species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of E. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983, and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. The isolation rate of Gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. Escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. These results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. In other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of the post-antibiotic effect of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium with ampicillin alone or combined with streptomycin: studies on a novel type of antimicrobial interaction.
AB  - Determination of post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and time-kill studies were made with twelve strains of Streptococcus faecalis and nine strains of Streptococcus faecium, comparing the effect of ampicillin alone with a combination of ampicillin and streptomycin at achievable serum concentrations. Bactericidal synergism (greater than or equal to one log10 decrease in viable counts) and prolongation in PAE (greater than or equal to 0.5 h) were demonstrated in all streptomycin-susceptible strains (Minimum inhibitory Concentration less than 2000 mcg/ml), whereas only one of five highly streptomycin-resistant strains exhibited a synergistic effect. A significant correlation between the magnitude of increased killing and the increase in recovery period by the combinations of ampicillin and streptomycin was demonstrated.
TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst fluid from autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. To study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with ADPKD receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus fecalis. The mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. Sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. Cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. These studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.
TI  - Constitutive expression of erythromycin resistance mediated by the ermAM determinant of plasmid pAM beta 1 results from deletion of 5' leader peptide sequences.
AB  - We have sequenced the erythromycin resistance determinant (erm) of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 to investigate its relationship to other known resistance determinants. We show that this determinant is strongly (99%) homologous at the DNA level to that of plasmid pAM77 (Streptococcus sanguis) and of transposon Tn917 (S. faecalis). Moreover, nucleotide sequence comparison with the determinants of pAM77 and Tn917 shows that most of the probable regulatory region is absent, providing an explanation for the constitutive expression of the pAM beta 1 erm determinant.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pAM beta 1 in Lactobacillus reuteri and between lactobacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAM beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from Streptococcus lactis to Lactobacillus reuteri, L. murinus, and L. fermentum. Transfer of pAM beta 1 between two L. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pAM beta 1 in crosses with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2.
TI  - Neonatal enterococcal sepsis: case-control study and description of an outbreak.
AB  - An increased incidence of neonatal sepsis caused by Group D streptococci, specifically enterococci (GDE), during a recent 6-month period prompted a 5-year review of enterococcal sepsis in our neonatal intensive care unit. Sixteen episodes occurred in 14 babies. GDE accounted for 8 of 19 (42%) episodes of neonatal bacteremia during the epidemic period vs. only 8 of 159 (5%) episodes during the remaining 4.5 years (endemic period) (P less than 0.001). Blood isolates were all identified as Streptococcus faecalis. A combination of three strain-typing methods successfully distinguished the epidemic organisms from endemic nursery strains of GDE and from "background" GDE flora in the hospital. Nursery isolates were all susceptible to ampicillin, intermediate or resistant to the aminoglycosides and variably resistant to the newer cephalosporins. There were no differences in antibiotic susceptibilities of the GDE or in characteristics of the patients that were unique to the epidemic. Neonates with GDE sepsis had a mean birth weight of 913 g, a mean gestational age of 27 weeks and a mean age of onset of sepsis of 8.5 weeks. Twenty-five controls, matched for birth weight and admission date, were identified. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) between cases and controls included: use of a nonumbilical central line (71 vs. 32%); days central line in place (26.5 vs. 6.5 days); and bowel resection (29 vs. 4%). This is the first reported outbreak of S. faecalis sepsis in neonates. GDE are important nosocomial pathogens that must be considered in late onset neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Activity of LY146032 against Enterococci with and without high-level aminoglycoside resistance, including two penicillinase-producing strains.
AB  - We tested the activity of LY146032 (LY) against 57 strains of enterococci collected from Chile, Thailand, and the United States. Some of the strains were resistant to high levels of gentamicin or streptomycin (or both), and two produced beta-lactamase (Bla+). MICs of LY ranged from 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, and MBCs ranged from 1 to 64 micrograms/ml. In time-kill assays, a 2 to 3 log10 killing effect was observed with LY against two Bla+ strains of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis and against three strains that were highly resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin. Synergism was demonstrated with LY and streptomycin against a Bla+ strain lacking high-level streptomycin resistance. These in vitro results suggest that LY should be studied further for possible use in treatment of enterococcal infections.
TI  - Responses of chickens to Streptococcus faecalis: genotype-housing interactions.
AB  - Hens from lines selected for high and low juvenile body weight were maintained in single-bird wire cages or in litter-floor flocks and inoculated intravenously with Streptococcus faecalis. Responses to the inoculation, as measured by changes in body weight, plasma xanthophyll levels, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, and mortality, were more severe in the high-body-weight line than the low-body-weight line. The effect of cage vs. floor housing varied according to genetic line. Responses of individuals to Str. faecalis could not be predicted from either plasma xanthophyll levels or numbers of heterophils and lymphocytes before inoculation. Diagnosis of field outbreaks would be difficult, because autopsies performed 14 days after inoculation revealed no lesions, and liver swabs positive for Str. faecalis were rare.
TI  - Combined use of phage typing, enterococcinotyping and species differentiation of  group D streptococci as an effective epidemiological tool.
AB  - Ninety-five group D streptococcal isolates from the feces of 95 healthy persons were compared with 157 group D streptococcal isolates from 38 patients of the surgical intensive care unit (sICU). The typing systems consisted of phage typing, enterococcinotyping and species differentiation. Strains isolated from fecal specimens showed high individuality (66 combination types) whereas strains from the sICU revealed strongly uniform types (32 combination types, three types comprised 83 isolates, i.e. 52.8%). Endogenous colonization was demonstrated by isolation of strains from different locations (throat, trachea, wounds, blood, urine, drains, catheters, and vaginal swabs) from the same patient, and routes of transmission of the same strains to several patients were traced. The combination of three systems revealed a good discrimination between isolates of fecal and extrafecal specimens. The investigation detected highly preferred types in strains of extrafecal origin which were rarely isolated from fecal specimens. This may indicate that only strains with special characters preferably were able to colonize extraintestinal sites.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization as an alternative vector delivery system for lactic streptococci.
AB  - Due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. By using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pVA797, the partially homologous cloning vector pVA838 was successfully introduced into various strains of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis. Frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Both pVA797 and pVA838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. Also, the shuttle vector pSA3, which shares partial homology with pVA797, was mobilized via conjugation. The use of S. lactis LM2301 as the intermediate donor allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. The construction of a vector containing a "DNA cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pVA797, pVA838, and pSA3, are also reported.
TI  - Production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  - Two Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth  and a meat medium with Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both S. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of S. faecalis in BHI broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the S. aureus inoculum was greater than the S. faecalis inoculum. S. aureus FRI-100 grown with B. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the S. aureus inoculum was much higher than the B. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), whereas S. aureus FRI-196E produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. S. aureus grown with E. coli in BHI broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the E. coli inoculum was greater than the S. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the E. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), S. aureus FRI-100 grown with P. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the P. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) CFU). It can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.
TI  - Role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. In E faecalis endocarditis there was a strong IgM response to E faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 Kd and a strong IgG response to 88-90 and 45-47 Kd bands. In E faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced IgG response to an E faecium band of 82-90 Kd. For S bovis endocarditis, there was a strong IgG response to several components of S bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 Kd. For S sanguis, there was a strong IgG response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 Kd. These patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. The delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.
TI  - Comparison of physiologic tests used to identify non-beta-hemolytic aerococci, enterococci, and streptococci.
AB  - Twenty-one reference strains and 88 clinical isolates of Aerococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus species were tested for reactions in the Rapid Strep (RS) and modified conventional tests. We conclude that some but not all of the tests in the RS system could be used to substitute for conventional tests. RS tests for hydrolysis of arginine, esculin, L-pyrrolidonyl-naphthylamide, production of acetyl methyl carbinol (Voges-Proskauer), and fermentation of arabinose, lactose, mannitol, raffinose, and sorbitol were satisfactory substitutes for conventional tests. However, the RS tests for hydrolysis of hippurate and starch and fermentation of inulin were not satisfactory substitutes for conventional tests. We also conclude that, of the five test tube Voges-Proskauer tests, the Coblentz modification is the most discriminatory.
TI  - LY146032: activity and resistance development in vitro.
AB  - LY146032, a new lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with vancomycin, teicoplanin, cefamandole and ciprofloxacin, against 107 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium spp. All staphylococci were susceptible to all agents, except that some of the methicillin-resistant strains were resistant to cefamandole. Only LY146032 and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal to Str. faecalis. Development of resistance was studied by serial transfers of ten selected strains. A stable greater than or equal to eight-fold increase of the MIC over the breakpoint was found to develop to a variable extent against all agents tested. Simultaneous development of resistance to any of the other antibiotics was registered in 11/200 tests.
TI  - A comparison of the in-vitro activity of seventeen antibiotics against Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of seventeen antibiotics against 177 clinical strains of Streptococcus faecalis was evaluated. Ampicillin and mezlocillin were the most active beta-lactams tested (geometric mean MICs, 0.61 and 0.74 mg/l, respectively). Aminoglycosides showed poor activity and 22.6% of the strains were resistant to 2000 mg/l of streptomycin. No correlation was observed between MICs of gentamicin and streptomycin. Moderate activity was observed when testing norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Teicoplanin and co-trimoxazole were extremely active, showing geometric mean MICs of 0.59 and 0.08 mg/l respectively. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Location of antibiotic resistance markers in clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis with similar antibiotypes.
AB  - Eight wild-type strains of Enterococcus faecalis, resistant to chloramphenicol (Cmr), erythromycin (Emr), tetracycline (Tcr), and minocycline (Mnr), were examined for the genetic basis of their antibiotic resistance, Five of the strains transferred all of their antibiotic resistance markers by conjugation, while the other three strains transferred only Tcr and Mnr. Cmr and Emr determinants were localized by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, in which the Cmr gene of plasmid pIP501, of group B Streptococcus origin, and the Emr gene of transposon Tn917, of E. faecalis origin, served as probes. A chromosomal location was found for the nonconjugative Cmr and Emr markers of one wild-type strain. In two strains these markers were carried by nonconjugative plasmids, and in the other strains they were carried by plasmids that transferred by conjugation. Plasmids isolated from three transconjugants resistant to tetracycline but susceptible to minocycline bore nucleotide sequences homologous to the tetL gene. Nucleotide sequences homologous to conjugative transposon Tn916, of E. faecalis origin, were detected by hybridization in the tetracycline-minocycline-resistant transconjugants. Three of these transconjugants were plasmid free, while four harbored conjugative cryptic plasmids. Sequences homologous to Tn916 were also found on two conjugative plasmids, one of which appeared to be a conjugative cryptic plasmid that had acquired chromosomal Tcr Mnr markers during transfer.
TI  - Lowering of cytoplasmic pH is essential for growth of Streptococcus faecalis at high pH.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus faecalis at high pH was significantly stimulated by carbonate. In the absence of added carbonate the cells were unable to grow at a pH above 9.5, but in media containing 50 mM HCO3- they grew even at pH 10.5. Both rate and yield of growth at pH 9.5 were significantly stimulated by as little as 5 mM carbonate. The cytoplasmic pH in growing cells was maintained at about 7.8 to 8.2, whereas the medium pH ranged from 8.4 to 9.5. Nigericin and gramicidin D, ionophores which conduct protons, blocked growth at pH 9.5 but not at pH 7.5. These results indicate that lowering of the cytoplasmic pH is essential for the growth of this organism at high pH.
TI  - Sodium/proton antiporter in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis, like other bacteria, accumulates potassium ions and expels sodium ions. This paper is concerned with the pathway of sodium extrusion. Earlier studies (D.L. Heefner and F.M. Harold, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:2798-2802, 1982) showed that sodium extrusion is effected by a primary, ATP-linked sodium pump. I report here that cells grown under conditions in which sodium ATPase is not induced can still expel sodium ions. This finding suggested the existence of an alternate pathway. Sodium extrusion by the alternate pathway requires the cells to generate a proton motive force. This conclusion rests on the following observations. (i) Sodium extrusion required glucose. (ii) Sodium extrusion was observed at neutral pH, which allows the cells to generate a proton motive force, but not at alkaline pH, which reduces the proton motive force to zero. (iii) Sodium extrusion was inhibited by the addition of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and of proton-conducting ionophores. (iv) In response to an artificial pH gradient (with the exterior acid), energy-depleted cells exhibited a transient sodium extrusion which was unaffected by treatments that dissipated the membrane potential and which was blocked by proton conductors. I propose that streptococci have two independent systems for sodium extrusion: an inducible sodium ATPase and a constitutive sodium/proton antiporter.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - High incidence of hemolysin production by Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis strains associated with human parenteral infections.
AB  - Hemolysin production, clumping (pheromone) response, transferability of the hemolytic trait, and drug resistance were examined in 97 clinical isolates of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis. The isolates were derived from various sources (i.e., urine, pus, vagina, sputum, bile, and blood), and approximately 60% were found to be hemolytic. About 85% of the hemolytic strains exhibited a clumping response, compared with about 49% of the nonhemolytic strains. Over 50% of the hemolytic strains carried transferable hemolysin determinants, and in no case were drug resistance genes linked. The hemolytic strains exhibited multiple drug resistance more frequently than did the nonhemolytic strains. In contrast to the high frequency of hemolysin producers among parenteral isolates, strains derived from fecal specimens of healthy individuals exhibited a low (17%) incidence of hemolysin production.
TI  - Comparison of single and multiple doses of prophylactic antibiotics in experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Single-doses or short-term administration of beta-lactam antibiotics alone or combined with aminoglucoside antibiotics have failed to consistently prevent experimental streptococcal endocarditis induced by high inocula of bacteria poorly susceptible to killing by these antibiotics. The optimal duration of administration of antibiotics for successful prophylaxis under these circumstances has not been established. We therefore tested, in rats with catheter-induced sterile aortic vegetations, the duration of administration of antibiotic necessary to prevent endocarditis induced by bacterial inocula 100 to 10,000 times the 90% infective dose of two tolerant viridans-group streptococci and two Streptococcus faecalis strains. Multiple-dose regimens of amoxicillin alone or of amoxicillin combined with gentamicin were studied. Against the two viridans group streptococci, successful prophylaxis was achieved with multiple doses of amoxicillin alone given over 24 to 48 hr and by the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin given for 6 to 24 hr. Against the two S. faecalis strains, multiple-dose regimens with amoxicillin alone failed, but the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin was successful when administered for 48 to 72 hr. Thus, after challenge with high bacterial inocula, repeated doses of a beta-lactam antibiotic alone were sufficient to prevent viridans streptococcal endocarditis, but multiple doses of a bactericidal combination (beta-lactam plus aminoglucoside), as necessary for the treatment of established endocarditis, were a prerequisite for successful prophylaxis of S. faecalis endocarditis.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of transposon Tn916 from Streptococcus faecalis to Mycoplasma hominis.
AB  - Transposon Tn916 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to Mycoplasma hominis by a mating process resembling conjugation with a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-7). Tn916 was inserted into the mycoplasmal chromosome in single and multiple copies.
TI  - Transfer functions of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1: organization of plasmid DNA encoding response to sex pheromone.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pAD1 (59.6 kilobases) of Streptococcus faecalis shows a 10,000-fold increase in transfer frequency following induction by the sex pheromone cAD1. Mutagenesis of the plasmid with transposon Tn917 was undertaken to determine the region(s) of pAD1 required for the mating response. The relevant genetic material was found to be distributed over a 31.2-kilobase contiguous region of the plasmid. Although insertions in two previously identified regions (traA and traB) exhibited increased transfer frequencies, insertions in five new regions (D, E, F, G, and H) decreased the ability of pAD1 to transfer. Insertions in region H allowed the cells to form visible mating aggregates, but the plasmid transfer frequency was decreased to levels below detection during a 1-h broth mating. Mutants with mutations in region G were able to form aggregates; however, insertions in regions D, E, and F prevented aggregate formation. Insertions in region C decreased the sensitivity of the cell to exogenous cAD1 and exhibited increased activity of the pheromone inhibitor iAD1. Surface protein profiles produced by a number of these mutants were examined, and in some cases were found to be different from those of the wild type. A map showing the various regions is presented, and related aspects of the regulation of the pAD1 mating response are discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the ends of the conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545.
AB  - The conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae transposes in various gram-positive bacterial genera following self-transfer and in Escherichia coli after cloning. Analysis of the junction fragments and of the targets before insertion and after excision of the element by DNA hybridization and sequencing indicated that Tn1545 (1) is not flanked by terminal repeated sequences in either direct or opposite orientation, (2) is flanked, in an asymmetric fashion, by terminal variable base pairs, one at the left and three at the right of the element, (3) inserts in a target DNA consensus sequence, (4) does not generate duplication of the target DNA upon insertion, and (5) excises precisely.
TI  - Activity of LY146032 in vitro and in experimental enterococcal pyelonephritis.
AB  - The efficacy of LY146032 (LY), a new lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and gentamicin and combinations of LY-ceftriaxone, LY-imipenem, and LY-gentamicin against 15 strains of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis by microtiter dilution and checkerboard techniques. LY was effective within a very narrow range of drug concentrations (from 0.125 to 2.0 micrograms/ml) and was more active than other agents tested against S. faecalis. Enhanced inhibition of S. faecalis was seen more frequently with combinations of either penicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside than with combinations of LY and gentamicin, imipenem, or ceftriaxone. The in vivo efficacy of LY was compared with that of vancomycin and ampicillin alone and combinations of vancomycin-gentamicin, ampicillin-gentamicin, and LY-gentamicin in a rat model of chronic enterococcal pyelonephritis. At a dose of 10 mg/kg given twice daily, LY reduced the number of organisms per kidney significantly compared with that in infected untreated controls within 48 h after the initiation of therapy. At 20 mg/kg given once a day, LY was less effective but reduced colony counts significantly after 4 days of therapy, and its activity was comparable to that of vancomycin or vancomycin-gentamicin given twice daily. LY may be a promising agent for the treatment of enterococcal infections.
TI  - Patterns of wound colonisation in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
AB  - The bacterial colonisation of ulcers related to vascular disease, amputation sites and sites of surgical vascular repair was studied in 122 patients with vascular disorders. Wounds were graded clinically on the basis of inflammation, oedema and exudate. They were sampled at weekly intervals in order to determine the duration of colonisation. The significance of potential pathogens was assessed. Vascular ulcers were of low mean wound grade (1.87), short duration (1.58 weeks) and potential pathogens were isolated from 82% of 38 wounds. Amputation sites were of a higher mean wound grade (2.48) and longer duration (2.52 weeks) when compared to vascular ulcers. Potential pathogens were isolated from 69% of 42 amputation sites. Sites of surgical vascular repair were similar to amputation sites with respect to mean wound grade (2.33) but of a mean duration (1.69 weeks) similar to that of vascular ulcers. Potential pathogens were isolated from 50% of 42 surgical vascular repair sites but they were not evenly distributed among limb (33%), groin (55%) and abdominal wounds (71%). Coliforms were isolated from similar numbers of all wounds. Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were evenly distributed with respect to the site of isolation. Pseudomonas spp. and S. aureus were associated more commonly with vascular ulcers and S. faecalis with sites of surgical vascular repair. The use of topical antiseptics and/or systemic antimicrobial agents had a minimal effect in reducing colonisation/infection in the wounds studied.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 19-5247 (T-2525) and interpretive criteria for disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - The activity of Ro 19-5247 (the active metabolite of the oral cephalosporin Ro 19-5248 [T-2588]) was compared with that of five orally active agents against a total of 331 bacterial strains. Ro 19-5247 was more active in vitro than amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cephalexin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and amoxicillin overall were more active than the other four agents against staphylococci. Ro 19-5247, amoxicillin-clavulanate, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime were equally active against nonenterococcal streptococci and more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. All six agents showed little or no activity against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. Against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, only amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate were active. The interpretive criteria for in vitro susceptibility testing with 10- and 30-micrograms Ro 19-5247 disks were established by regression analysis to correlate the inhibitory zone sizes and MICs for the bacterial isolates. The suggested tentative zone size breakpoints for the 10-micrograms disk are as follows: susceptible, greater than or equal to 22 mm (MIC, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml); moderately susceptible, 20 to 21 mm (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml); and resistant, less than or equal to 19 mm (MIC, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Penetration of bacteria and spermatozoa into bovine cervical mucus.
AB  - It has been reported that bacteria may attach to motile spermatozoa, be carried through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes, and cause acute salpingitis. In an attempt to mimic these conditions in vitro, we incubated Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus with motile spermatozoa which then were allowed to migrate through a capillary filled with bovine cervical mucus. After satisfactory sperm migration through the mucus, the capillaries were broken and cultured at different distances from the original insemination site. Mucus fractions in proximity to bacterial inocula grew varying amounts of the pathogens. More distal fractions of mucus columns were generally culture-negative even though they contained motile sperm which had been exposed to bacteria. Migration of spermatozoa exposed to bacteria through bovine cervical mucus did not result in enhanced bacterial penetration.
TI  - Homology of a transferable tetracycline resistance determinant of Clostridium difficile with Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis transposon Tn916.
AB  - In several tetracycline-resistant (Tetr) Clostridium difficile strains, homology  with the Tn916 part of plasmid pAM120 DNA was observed. This 15-kilobase transposon, carrying a Tetr determinant, was originally found in Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. Hybridization experiments revealed that at least six of seven HincII fragments of Tn916, representing greater than 95% of its length, showed homology with DNA of Tetr C. difficile strains. Therefore, a close relationship of the C. difficile Tetr-determining element with the entire Tn916 transposon can be assumed, although differences were observed concerning the number of HindIII cleavage sites within the transposon. In addition to strong hybridization of Tetr determinants of C. difficile with Tn916, weak signals were detected when DNA of Tets C. difficile was hybridized with Tn916. These weak signals could be attributed to a single internal HincII fragment of Tn916.
TI  - Different activity of penicillins and cephalosporins on enterococci.
AB  
TI  - Incidence, clinical distribution, and susceptibility to several antibiotics of enterococci isolated in some Italian regions.
AB  
TI  - In vivo and in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin against 12 streptococcal isolates in a neutropenic site model.
AB  - Closed-space neutropenic infection sites were simulated in rabbits by subcutaneous semipermeable chambers that were inoculated with 5 X 10(4) CFU/ml of various strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus avium. Four hours after inoculation, treatment was begun with ciprofloxacin, 10 or 30 mg/kg, azlocillin, 100 mg/kg, amikacin, 15 mg/kg, procaine penicillin G, 300 U/dose, or gentamicin, 2 mg/kg, alone and in two-drug combinations. Antimicrobials were given intramuscularly every 6 hr for 16 doses. Extravascular chambers were sampled throughout the treatment course for bacterial counts and antimicrobial concentration. In vivo results were compared to in vitro tests of inhibition, killing, and synergism. Ciprofloxacin alone had little effect on the animal infection sites. Azlocillin alone reduced, in vivo, eight of 12 isolates greater than or equal to 5 log10 CFU/ml by 92 hr as compared to control. Azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin reduced all 12 isolates greater than or equal to 5 log10 CFU/ml by 92 hr, whereas amikacin plus azlocillin reduced only three and penicillin plus gentamicin only one of the six group D streptococcal isolates greater than or equal to 5 log10 CFU/ml.
TI  - Comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  - The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
TI  - beta-Lactamase production in experimental endocarditis due to aminoglycoside-resistant Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We used a beta-lactamase-producing (beta L+) strain of Streptococcus faecalis that also had high levels of resistance to all aminoglycosides to induce experimental endocarditis in rats. The rats were treated for five or 10 days with procaine penicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, or ciprofloxacin (alone or in various combinations), or with penicillin plus clavulanic acid. The levels of penicillin in serum and vegetations declined rapidly in the beta L+-infected rats treated with procaine penicillin alone, unlike the sustained levels of penicillin in either beta L- -infected rats treated with procaine penicillin or beta L+-infected rats treated with penicillin plus clavulanic acid. For the beta L+-infected rats, the enterococcal counts in vegetations were significantly reduced (greater than 3 log10 cfu/g) only by vancomycin and by penicillin plus clavulanic acid. The efficacy of the latter regimen probably resulted from the inhibition of penicillin inactivation by clavulanic acid in vegetations infected with the beta L+ strain. Our in vivo findings document the biologic significance of beta-lactamase production.
TI  - Two conjugation systems associated with Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10: identification of a conjugative transposon that transfers between S. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF10 (58 kilobases [kb]) of Streptococcus faecalis possesses two separate conjugation systems. A 25-kb region of the plasmid (designated TRA) was shown previously to determine pheromone response and conjugation functions required for transfer of pCF10 between S. faecalis cells (P. J. Christie and G. M. Dunny, Plasmid 15:230-241, 1986). When S. faecalis cells were mixed with Bacillus subtilis in broth, tetracycline resistance was transferred from S. faecalis. The tetracycline-resistant B. subtilis cells contained a 16-kb region of pCF10 (distinct from TRA) that carried the tetracycline resistance determinant (Tetr). This Tetr element was found to transfer between S. faecalis and B. subtilis strains in the absence of plasmids. Genetic and molecular techniques were used to establish locations of the element at several different sites on the B. subtilis chromosome. The Tetr element could be transferred in filter matings from B. subtilis to S. faecalis strains and between recombination-proficient and -deficient S. faecalis strains in the absence of any plasmid DNA. The transfer required direct cell-to-cell contact and was not inhibited by DNase. The Tetr element was shown to transpose from the S. faecalis chromosome to various locations within the hemolysin plasmid pAD1. Together, the data indicate that the Tetr element, termed transposon Tn925, is very similar to the conjugative transposon Tn916 in both structure and function. A derivative of Tn925, containing transposon Tn917 inserted into a site approximately 3 kb from one end, exhibited elevated transfer frequencies and may provide a useful means for delivering Tn917 by conjugation into various gram-positive species.
TI  - Cloning of the K+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis. Structural and evolutionary implications of its homology to the KdpB-protein of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The K+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis consists of a single polypeptide component of relative Mr = 78,000 and serves as an ATP-driven pump for the accumulation of potassium by the bacterial cell. The gene encoding this ATPase was isolated by immunological screening of an S. faecalis genomic library in the Escherichia coli/pUC8 host/vector system. Two independently derived clones express the full-size ATPase polypeptide. Transcription and translation of the cloned DNA apparently proceed by means of the respective S. faecalis signals. DNA sequencing revealed a gene encoding a protein of 583 amino acids and a calculated Mr of 63,070. This protein exhibits in its primary structure regions of homology with the KdpB-subunit of the K+-ATPase of E. coli and, to a lesser extent, with eukaryotic ion-motive ATPases. The hydropathy profiles and secondary structure predictions, respectively, for the S. faecalis ATPase and the E. coli KdpB-protein show striking similarity. Even regions with low homology in the amino acid sequence exhibit structural features that have clearly been conserved in the two proteins. This points to a fundamental role of these domains in the structure and/or function of these transport ATPases.
TI  - [Effects of loperamide on the fecal flora in children in severe diarrheas].
AB  - Loperamide has been recently indicated in the management of infants with severe protracted diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of loperamide on fecal flora in severe protracted diarrheas. 19 children aged 1 to 36 months, with severe protracted diarrhea were studied: 14 received loperamide (0.5 mg/kg/d) and 5 were without loperamide treatment. Criteria analysed were: clinical tolerance (vomiting and abdominal distention); efficacy (number of stools, transit time and Na+/K+ in stools) and effect on fecal flora, with differential qualitative and quantitative analysis method (complete identification and counts of aerobic and strict anaerobic bacteria in fresh fecal samples before and 4 to 8 days after the beginning of loperamide). Parenteral and/or oral alimentation remain constant during the study. Results show a rapid (24 h) efficacy in 9/14. Although important changes in specific fecal flora counts was noticed for streptococcus D and Proteus as compared to five controls, no bacterial overgrowth appeared or was increased during loperamide treatment.
TI  - [In vitro study of the combination of pefloxacin with other antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus group D].
AB  - The comparative susceptibility of 50 isolates of enterococci and 50 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to pefloxacin and different antibiotics was tested using MIC determination. The results showed only 6% sensitive strains of enterococci and 36% of P. aeruginosa. The high level resistant streptococci against aminoglycosides and resistant Pseudomonas strains have weakly higher MIC than sensitive strains. The activity of the combination of pefloxacin and other antibiotics was determined by a checkerboard micromethod. Fractional concentration index (FIC and FBC) show most frequently addition, uncommonly synergy.
TI  - The effect of ampicillin and tylosin on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  - Enterococcal isolates from young chickens were differentiated into one of three species, namely Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. gallinarum. The proportion of each species among the enterococcal population changed with time in birds not dosed with antibiotics. This pattern of change was modified in birds dosed with either tylosin or ampicillin even though ampicillin did not select for ampicillin resistance among the enterococcal population. A gradual increase in tylosin resistance was recorded with time among the enterococci of the 'undosed' control birds. This was associated with an increase in the proportion of Ent. faecium, a species commonly resistant to tylosin, among the enterococci of the birds as they grew older.
TI  - Comparison of most probable number and pour plate procedures for isolation and enumeration of sulphite-reducing Clostridium spores and group D faecal streptococci from oysters.
AB  - A comparative study of methods to enumerate sulphite-reducing Clostridium spores  and Group D faecal streptococci in oysters demonstrated that pour plate solid agar techniques gave higher counts than liquid broth most probable number procedures. Reinforced clostridial broth with supplements to detect sulphite reduction was compared with pour plates of egg yolk-free tryptose sulphite cycloserine agar incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Azide dextrose broth was compared with pour plates using Slanetz and Bartley (SB) agar or KF-streptococcus agar at 37 degrees C. Most probable number procedures used for both groups of organisms gave excessive numbers of improbable tube combinations. For enumeration of Group D faecal streptococci, a pour plate technique using SB agar incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h is recommended.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium and susceptibility studies with newly developed antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Identification and susceptibility studies were performed on 301 blood and urine Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium isolates. Strep Trio-Tubes S4, S5, and S3 (Carr-Scarborough Microbiologicals, Inc.) were compared with conventional methods for accuracy and rapidity. Of 282 isolates identified as S. faecalis, 98% were identified by species in 4 h with Trio-Tubes; the same percentage of isolates analyzed by conventional methods were identified in 24 h. All 14 S. faecium isolates (approximately 5% of the total number of isolates) were identified by Trio-Tubes in 24 h. In vitro MIC susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by the Dynatech 2000 microdilution technique (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.). Several newly developed antimicrobial agents, including imipenem (a carbapenem) and some of the quinolone drugs, i.e., CI-934, ciprofloxacin, A-56619, A-56620, amifloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin, were tested, as were ampicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. Both ampicillin and vancomycin showed good activity against S. faecalis, with MICs for 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively; with S. faecium, ampicillin exhibited an MIC90 of 16 micrograms/ml and vancomycin exhibited an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Of the newer antimicrobial agents, imipenem and CI-934 exhibited the greatest activity against S. faecalis strains, with MIC90S of 2 and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. MBCs against the isolates were determined with CI-934, with 90% of S. faecalis strains showing MBCs of 1 microgram/ml or less.
TI  - Nosocomial infection by gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus faecalis. An epidemiologic study.
AB  - Enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin account for 55% of clinical  isolates of enterococci found in patients at the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Medical Center. We prospectively studied cultures obtained from all 100 patients hospitalized from 1 December 1985 through 23 January 1986 on the surgical and thoracic intensive care units and a general medical floor. Ten patients' cultures grew colonies of gentamicin-resistant enterococci--six after admission to the intensive care units and four after hospitalization on the medical ward. The initial sites of colonization were the rectal and perineal areas in seven patients, sternal wound in one, urine in one, and the rectal and perineal areas as well as urine after Foley catheter insertion in one. Nine patients died and three of the deaths were associated with enterococcal infection. The acquisition of resistant strains was associated with previous and more frequent exposure to antimicrobial agents, and with geographic clustering of patients. Resistant enterococci were isolated from the hands of hospital personnel and were frequently isolated from environmental surfaces. Nosocomial acquisition and interhospital spread of gentamicin-resistant enterococci was shown to have occurred when plasmid content was used as an epidemiologic marker.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon Tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of aphA-3 genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant aphA-3 encoded by transposon Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pJH1 and pIP1433 from Streptococcus faecalis and Campylobacter coli, respectively. The three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid pSH2 from Staphylococcus aureus. Comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the aphA-3 gene in pJH1 and in Tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pIP1433. In the latter plasmid, aphA-3 is transcribed from a promoter, P1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. The rearrangement observed in pJH1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of P1. The promoter thus generated. P1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as P1. However, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical promoter P1 is significantly less efficient than P1'. From analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. The transition from pIP1433 to pJH1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the aphA-3 gene. The deletion event in Tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed P1 in its entirety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Generation of Tn5 insertions in streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - A method has been developed for the introduction of Tn5 into Escherichia coli plasmid chimeras containing Streptococcus faecalis DNA. Tn5 could be introduced via a lambda::Tn5 delivery vehicle. The system proved to be particularly efficient and facilitated insertions at numerous sites on DNA containing the 16-kilobase conjugative transposon Tn916. It was possible to introduce some of the resulting Tn916::Tn5 derivatives back into S. faecalis by using a recently developed protoplast transformation procedure. A presumed zygotic induction resulted in insertion of the Tn916 derivatives at multiple sites in the S. faecalis chromosome.
TI  - Transfer of the conjugal tetracycline resistance transposon Tn916 from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus aureus and identification of some insertion sites in the staphylococcal chromosome.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis pheromone-dependent conjugative plasmid pAD1::Tn916 and the membrane filter-dependent conjugative plasmid pPD5::Tn916 were used to introduce Tn916 into Staphylococcus aureus by intergeneric protoplast fusions and intergeneric membrane-filter matings. In recombinants obtained by protoplast fusion where no plasmid DNA could be detected, tetracycline resistance resulted from transposition of Tn916 from pAD1 to the S. aureus chromosome. Transformation analyses showed that S. aureus Tn916 chromosomal insertions occurred near pig, ilv, uraA, tyrB, fus, ala, and the trp operon. DNA hybridization analyses of EcoRI- and HindIII-digested chromosomal DNAs confirmed the diversity of chromosomal sites involved and demonstrated that the inserts were Tn916 insertions rather than integrations of all or part of pAD1::Tn916. Both pAD1::Tn916 and pPD5::Tn916 were transferred to S. aureus by membrane-filter matings. These plasmids remained intact and expressed tetracycline resistance in S. aureus. S. aureus strains carrying pAD1::Tn916, but not a chromosomal insert of Tn916, and any one of several conjugal gentamicin-resistance plasmids lost their ability to serve as conjugal donors of the gentamicin-resistance plasmids.
TI  - Effect of infection with Eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. There were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and E. tenella. Seven days after E. tenella infection, counts of B. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for E. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by B. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after E. tenella infection, counts were higher for E. tennella-infected birds. The population of L. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the E. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. No significant differences were observed between the numbers of B. vulgatus, C. perfringens, and S. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without E. tenella infections.
TI  - Effect of histological decalcifying agents on number and stainability of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In tests of the effects of restorative materials on dental pulp, it is important  that one evaluate bacterial contamination, and this is usually done histologically. Preceding the usual paraffin-embedding of hard-tissue specimens for microscopical investigations, decalcification is performed. To study the influence of decalcifying agents (nitric acid, formic acid, and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) on the number and Gram-stainability of bacteria, we used a model system consisting of suspensions of formaldehyde-fixed Streptococcus faecalis. The Gram-positive organisms were stored in distilled water, in 4% formaldehyde solution, or in the decalcifying agents for various experimental periods. Counts were made by means of a hemocytometer, and smears were stained with the Brown and Brenn staining method. After periods which are averages for the decalcification of teeth, severe reductions of both the number and the Gram-positive stainability were found. After one week in formic acid, only one out of 15 organisms stained blue. With nitric acid and EDTA, the reductions were fewer. Since only blue-staining bacteria can be detected clearly in tissue sections, the results of these experiments indicate that, with limited numbers of organisms, the risk exists for false-negative scores for decalcified hard-tissue sections.

TI  - Kinetics of activation of L-lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus faecalis by  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and by metal ions.
AB  - The lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus faecalis is activated either by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or by divalent cations such as Mn2+ or Co2+. With both types of activator, a lag is observed before attainment of the steady state rate of pyruvate reduction if the activator is added to the enzyme at the same time as the substrates. This lag can be largely abolished by preincubation of enzyme with activator before mixing with substrates. For fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru(1,6)P2) as the activator, the rate constant for the lag phase showed a linear dependence on activator concentration but was independent of enzyme concentration. This suggests that binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate induces a conformational change in the enzyme which leads to increased activity, without association of enzyme subunits or dimers. With Co2+ as activator, the rate constant for the lag phase showed a hyperbolic dependence on Co2+ concentration and was also dependent on enzyme concentration. This suggests that activation by Co2+, in contrast to that by Fru(1,6)P2, involves association of enzyme dimers, followed by ligand binding.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Therapeutic effects of imipenem-cilastatin on experimental intrauterine infections in rats.
AB  - The therapeutic effects of imipenem-cilastatin (MK-0787-MK-791) on experimental intrauterine infections in progesterone-treated virgin rats and postpartum rats were studied. The relative efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of such intrauterine infections was compared with that of cefazolin and ampicillin for the treatment of infections caused by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis, respectively. Treatment with imipenem-cilastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of E. coli and S. faecalis in uteri, as compared with the proliferation in untreated controls. Cefazolin failed to affect the E. coli infection. With the S. faecalis infection, ampicillin effectively reduced bacterial growth, as compared with that in untreated controls. However, ampicillin was inferior to and comparable to imipenem-cilastatin in progesterone-treated virgin rats and postpartum rats, respectively. A further experiment with S. faecalis infections in rats made neutropenic by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide showed that the therapeutic effectiveness of imipenem-cilastatin was superior to that of ampicillin and was not influenced by neutropenia. Our results suggest that imipenem-cilastatin may be a useful agent for the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.

AB  - The sex pheromone inhibitor iPD1, which is excreted by Streptococcus faecalis donor strains harboring bacteriocin plasmid pPD1 and which inhibits sex pheromone cPD1, was isolated, and its structure was determined. Its molecular weight is 828, and its amino acid sequence is H-Ala-Leu-Ile-Leu-Thr-Leu-Val-Ser-OH.

TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - Human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  - Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hCG), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the COOH-terminal peptide of hCG beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hCG beta, demonstrated expression of hCG-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. Seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as Streptococcus faecalis (three strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (single strains). The other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (CWD) variants, one identified as Streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. The other was a Gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a Gram-positive Corynebacterium identified as a 'C. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hCG-like factor only during its phase as Gram-negative diphtheroid. Electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hCG-like material including the two CWD variants. Collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hCG-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hCG molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins in Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775, S. faecium NCTC 7171 and an isolate of S. faecium (strain 37) highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were visualised by autoradiography. Five PBPs were detected in S. faecalis NCTC 775 and six in S. faecium NCTC 7171. Additional PBPs could not be found in the resistant isolate of S. faecium. The PBP affinities of beta lactams were compared with MIC values. The affinities of PBPs 3 and 4 of S. faecalis NCTC 775 for penicillin G, ampicillin, cefathiamidine, cephaloridine and cephazolin were related to the sensitivity of the strain to these antibiotics as were the affinities of PBPs 4 and 5 in each S. faecium strain for the beta lactams. It is postulated that PBPs 3 and 4 of S. faecalis NCTC 775 and PBPs 4 and 5 of S. faecium are the relevant target enzymes of the test antibiotics. PBPs 4 and 5 of the highly beta-lactam-resistant S. faecium strain 37 showed proportionally low affinities for the five beta lactams compared to that of the less resistant strain S. faecium NCTC 7171. Decreased affinities of PBPs 4 and 5 may account for the resistance in S. faecium strain 37 to beta lactams. The affinities for PBP 1, 2 and 5 in S. faecalis NCTC 775 and PBPs 1, 2, 3 and 6 in S. faecium were not related to the antibiotic sensitivities.
TI  - Tn916-induced mutations in the hemolysin determinant affecting virulence of Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - A genetic determinant essential for hemolysin production by Listeria monocytogenes has been inactivated by insertion of transposon Tn916 into L. monocytogenes DNA. The transposon was transferred by means of conjugation of a streptomycin-resistant L. monocytogenes recipient strain with Streptococcus faecalis CG110 on membrane filters. Among the tetracycline-resistant transconjugants, mutants were detected which had lost hemolytic activity. When tested in a mouse model, these mutants appeared to have lost the virulence that characterizes the parental strain. An extracellular protein of 58,000 apparent molecular weight was eliminated in the nonhemolytic mutants. In some of the mutants, the decrease in the production of the 58,000-dalton protein was accompanied by the production of a new protein of 49,000 apparent molecular weight. Hemolytic revertants regained the hemolytic phenotype and virulence and produced the extracellular protein that characterizes the recipient strain. Hybridization studies with Tn916 DNA indicated that the transposon is present in EcoRI and HindIII fragments of the nonhemolytic mutants. Single copies of Tn916 were detected in the chromosomal DNA of two of the three nonhemolytic mutants that were studied in detail. In hemolytic, tetracycline-sensitive revertants Tn916 appeared to be completely excised from the chromosome.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in children].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 22 children with bacterial infections (Table 1). The results obtained are summarized below. MICs of CZON to 26 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 2. MICs to all 14 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 0.05 microgram/ml. The MIC to 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 0.39 microgram/ml and that to another was 0.78 microgram/ml. Two strains of Escherichia coli showed MICs of less than 0.05 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. The MIC to 1 strain of Enterococcus faecalis was 6.25 micrograms/ml. The CZON was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at a daily dosage ranging from 58.5 to 85.7 mg/kg by 30-minute drip infusion or intravenous injection to 22 patients (9 cases of pneumonia, 9 cases of tonsillitis, 2 cases of bronchitis, 1 case each of suppurative parotitis and acute pyelonephritis) and the following clinical results were obtained; excellent: 12 cases; good: 7 cases; fair: 3 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 86% (Table 4). Diarrhea was observed in four patients, and was resolved with or without discontinuation of the medication within a week. Anemia was noted in 2 cases. Leucopenia and neutropenia was observed in 1 case. There were a moderate rises in S-GOT and S-GPT activities in 1 patient (Table 4), and they necessitated the cessation of the CZON therapy. The S-GOT and S-GPT activities became normal after the drug treatment was stopped.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The sensitivity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to ofloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 165 gram-negative rods, both fermentative and non-fermentative and against 57 gram-positive strains (coagulase-positive and -negative, staphylococci both methicillin-resistant and susceptible and Streptococcus faecalis). Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by using the macrodilution test and activity was compared with nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime and gentamicin for gram-negative rods, norfloxacin and gentamicin for Staphylococcus strains, and norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin and gentamicin for enterococci. Ofloxacin inhibited all fermentative gram-negative bacteria tested, in a range of 0.05-3.12 micrograms/ml. It also had good antimicrobial activity against non-fermentative gram-negative strains: in fact it inhibited 90% of Acinetobacter and 80% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa tested at 3.12 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin had good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus and Enterococcus tested.

TI  - Continuous-infusion ampicillin therapy of enterococcal endocarditis in rats.
AB  - Intermittent administration of ampicillin alone has resulted in high failure rates in previously described animal models of enterococcal endocarditis. We developed a rat model of enterococcal endocarditis which permits comparison of continuous intravenous infusion of ampicillin with intramuscular therapy. Continuous low-dose ampicillin infusion (450 mg/kg [body weight] per day) was compared with the same dose given intramuscularly in three divided doses and with high-dose infusion (4.5 g/kg per day) of the drug. For the infecting strain of Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC and MBC were 1 microgram/ml. Mean ampicillin levels in serum were 53.9 +/- 4.8 (peak) and less than 1 (trough), 8.7 +/- 1.4, and 244 +/- 29 micrograms/ml for intramuscular, low-dose, and high-dose regimens, respectively. Ampicillin infusion therapy significantly increased the survival rate and sterilization of blood cultures. Continuous infusions were superior to intermittent therapy in eradicating bacteremia. After 5 days of treatment, low-dose ampicillin infusion was more effective than intermittent therapy in sterilizing cardiac vegetations (P less than 0.01). Continuous-infusion therapy at either dose was significantly more effective than intramuscular injection in reducing bacterial titers in cardiac vegetations (5.4 +/- 1.0 log10 CFU/g [low dose], 4.8 +/- 0.3 log10 CFU/g [high dose], and 7.7 +/- 0.3 log10 CFU/g [intramuscular]). However, no statistically significant advantage was found for high-dose compared with low-dose ampicillin infusion in lowering bacterial titers in vegetations (P greater than 0.3).
TI  - Enterococci and aminoglycosides: evaluation of susceptibility and synergism of their combination with piperacillin.
AB  - Some clinical isolates of enterococci were tested for susceptibility to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin. Five percent of Streptococcus faecalis tested demonstrated high level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 2024 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin, while amikacin had MICs greater than 128 micrograms/ml for all strains tested. Since a combination of a beta-lactam and streptomycin does not produce synergism against all strains of enterococci for an increase in the number of highly resistant strains, the effect of piperacillin plus gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin was examined. The combination piperacillin + netilmicin seemed to be very effective against all enterococci tested.
TI  - Biotyping, serotyping and phage typing of Streptococcus faecalis isolated from dental plaque in the human mouth.
AB  - Thirty Streptococcus faecalis isolates from mixed dental plaque samples were classified into four groups on the basis of biotype, tetracycline susceptibility, phage type and serotype combinations. The organisms were from patients on haemodialysis, from staff of the dialysis unit, and from controls. Three biotypes were distinguished by seven biochemical tests: production of acid from inositol, sucrose and xylose; rapid or delayed production of acid from sorbitol; gelatin liquefaction; and production of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase. With a set of eight typing antisera for S. faecalis, 15 strains were non-typable, 12 were serotype 1 and three were serotype 19. With a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for S. faecalis, all of the oral isolates were typable; 40% were lysotype I1 and the remainder lysotype V6b. On the basis of biotype-serotype-phage-type combinations, indications of possible spread of strains between haemodialysis patients and dialysis unit staff were obtained. Biotyping and serotyping of 13 German isolates of S. faecalis of phage type I1 from four clinical sources and tripartite typing of three control strains provided additional evidence for the potential of biotyping in distinguishing between strains of identical serotype and phage type. One oral isolate of S. faecium was of phage type XX. None of the oral isolates of S. faecalis, of which 14 exhibited delayed sorbitol fermentation, reacted with group-G streptococcal grouping reagents or antiserum. Slow sorbitol fermentation does not appear to be a definitive phenotypic marker for S. faecalis strains possessing antigens that react with both group-D and group-G grouping reagents.
TI  - Serodiagnosis of Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis by immunoblotting of surface protein antigens.
AB  - We describe a method for the serodiagnosis of Streptococcus faecalis in infective endocarditis which could be of value in culture-negative cases. Serum-grown cells of S. faecalis produced three major characteristic protein antigens (73,000, 40,000, and 37,000 molecular weight) which were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized whole cells. After electrophoretic transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, these antigens were visualized by probing with serum from patients with endocarditis caused by S. faecalis. Serum from patients with endocarditis caused by other organisms did not react with the S. faecalis-specific antigens. This procedure should facilitate positive early diagnosis of S. faecalis endocarditis or establish its absence in culture-negative cases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. MICs of LY146032 were lowest for Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus the MICs were 1 mg/l, for Enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and for Enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. The activity of LY146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. Time-kill studies showed LY146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Carriage rates of enterococci in the dental plaque of haemodialysis patients in Dublin.
AB  - The incidence of carriage of enterococci in dental plaque was determined in haemodialysis patients attending three clinics in the Dublin area either as outpatients or as hospitalised patients. Their carriage rates were compared with a University group comprising normal healthy students, academic staff, technicians and ancillary personnel and with a cohort of otherwise healthy toothache patients. The carriage rates among the staffs of the dialysis units also were examined. The overall carriage rates of enterococci of the University group, the toothache patient group, the haemodialysis patients and the dialysis unit staffs did not differ significantly from each other, ranging from 5%-20%. However, the dental plaque of a mainly hospitalised group of haemodialysis patients and their attendant staff at one clinic was colonised to a statistically significant higher degree with enterococci than that of the haemodialysis patients and the staff at the outpatient clinics, both separately and as combined patient and staff groups. Age, sex, a history of recent antibiotic therapy, and elapsed time since the last dental visit did not affect isolation rates to a significant extent. The commonest enterococcus isolated from subjects was Streptococcus faecalis, followed by its variety liquefaciens. Only one subject harboured Streptococcus durans in dental plaque. Ten of the 21 subjects yielding enterococci harboured two different enterococci in their plaque. The isolation of S. faecalis var liquefaciens alone or in combination with S. faecalis did not correlate with subject-history parameters. The findings obtained imply that antibiotic prophylaxis specifically against enterococci may be necessary only for a small number of haemodialysis patients in whom oral carriage of enterococci has been demonstrated bacteriologically.
TI  - Arginine modification with butanedione inhibits the potassium ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The K+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis is inhibited by incubation with the arginine-modifying reagent 2,3-butanedione. The inactivation proceeds by pseudo - first order kinetics and a double-logarithmic plot of the pseudo - first order rate constants versus reagent concentrations yields a reaction order of 1.14 with respect to butanedione. Partially inactivated ATPase exhibits a decreased maximal velocity but the same affinity for ATP, as compared to the native enzyme. Butanedione modification is inhibited by adenine nucleotides. These results indicate the involvement of most likely one crucial arginyl residue in adenine nucleotide binding by the ATPase.
TI  - The sensitivity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to ofloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 165 Gram-negative rods, both fermentative and non-fermentative, and against 57 Gram-positive strains (coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci both methicillin-resistant and -susceptible, and Streptococcus faecalis). Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by using the macrodilution test and the activity was compared with nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime and gentamicin for Gram-negative rods; norfloxacin and gentamicin for Staphylococcus strains; and norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin and gentamicin for enterococci. Ofloxacin inhibited all fermentative Gram-negative bacteria tested, in a range of 0.05-3.12 mcg/ml, and had good antimicrobial activity against non-fermentative Gram-negative strains: it inhibited 90% of Acinetobacter and 80% of P. aeruginosa tested, at 3.12 mcg/ml. Ofloxacin had a high antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains tested.

TI  - Antibody response and dental caries in the bacterium Streptococcus-mono-associated, caries-resistant and caries-susceptible rats.
AB  - Correlations between rat strain, agglutinating antibody responses in serum or saliva and caries incidence, previously observed in Harvard rats mono-associated with Streptococcus faecalis and given diet L128 and 5 per cent sucrose added to drinking water, were not found when experiments were repeated with the low-sucrose diet 305. Mono-association with either Streptococcus mutans 6715 or Strep. faecalis ND547 produced extensive caries in caries-susceptible (HCS) rats and little or no caries in resistant (HCR) ones, but caries incidence did not relate to levels of agglutinating antibodies in serum or saliva. There was markedly less serum antibody to Strep. faecalis in the HCR rats and more antibody in HCS rats, when compared to previous results, but this did not affect caries scores in either strain. No agglutinating antibody to Strep. mutans was detected in serum and indefinite antibody appeared in saliva. Under these conditions, the ability to produce an agglutinating antibody response did not appear to play a role in caries resistance.

AB  - 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15N2]-urea and [15N]-ammonium chloride. The rates of [15N]-incorporation were calculated. They depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered NPN-substance and on the amount of NPN-substance in the medium. With [15N2]-urea the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (E coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (Bifidobacterium sp.). With [15N]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (Proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (Bifidobacterium sp.). The findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.
TI  - Experimentally induced Bacteroides infections in the rabbit.
AB  - Rabbits were infected with Bacteroides fragilis, B. macacae and B. gingivalis in  monoinfection, mixed Bacteroides infection, and mixed infection of B. gingivalis with Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium sporogenes. Monoinfection gave rise to localised, nodular abscesses at cell levels greater than 0.5 X 10(5) cfu ml-1, the severity of which was dose related. Mixed infections including B. gingivalis caused severe spreading lesions and affected organs distant from the injection site. Histopathological studies indicate an inflammatory response with gas vacuolation and local necrosis.
TI  - The effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis, while Ps. aeruginosa, Str. faecalis and Str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. But when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. The levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. When lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on B. subtilis was restored. The growth of Staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cAD1) response: evidence that the peptide inhibitor excreted by pAD1-containing cells may be plasmid determined.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strains harboring the conjugative plasmid pAD1 excrete a small peptide, iAD1, which inhibits the sex pheromone cAD1. Studies making use of the host strain Streptococcus faecium 9790, which normally does not excrete peptide pheromones, suggest that iAD1 may be determined directly by pAD1.
TI  - Quality control limits for microdilution susceptibility tests with norfloxacin.
AB  - A multilaboratory study was designed to define quality control limits for microdilution susceptibility tests with norfloxacin. The following limits were proposed: for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.125 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml; and for Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml. The latter represents a change in the previously recommended control limits.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of teicoplanin and other antimicrobials against streptococci  group D bacteria.
AB  - In vitro activities of teicoplanin were compared with those of ampicillin, imipenem, rifampicin, coumermycin and vancomycin against clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis (n = 100) and Streptococcus faecium (n = 30). Against Str. faecalis, ampicillin and imipenem had an MIC90 and MBC90 of 3.9 micrograms/ml. Coumermycin and rifampicin had poor bactericidal activity with MBC90 values of 31.2 and 62.5 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin was extremely active with an MIC90 of 0.95 microgram/ml and an MBC90 of 1.86 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Pathological study of Streptococcus faecalis antigen-induced arthritis in New Zealand white rabbits].
AB  - The pathological examination of the rabbit knee joint with antigen-induced arthritis produced by heat-killed Streptococcus faecalis (Str. faec.) as antigen was carried out. Macroscopically, there were findings of acute inflammation about five hours after the injection. Histopathologically, very remarkable acute exudative inflammation was seen 48 hours later. This supported the picture of Arthus reaction. The Arthus reaction disappeared with time, and this supported the view of delayed-type hypersensitivity three weeks later. After that, an obvious chronic inflammation was admitted in 10 weeks. This resembled the histopathological feature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when these findings are summarized. It was suggested that arthritis produced by Str. faec. progresses from an acute condition to a one with time. As mentioned above, it thought that Arthus reaction of both immediate hypersensitivity and delayed-type hypersensitivity are necessary in the occurrence of this arthritis.
TI  - The influence of penicillin and quinaldofur on the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis in milk.

TI  - Studies on Streptococcus faecalis enterotoxin.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis has been reported to cause food poisoning. Six strains of  S. faecalis were tested for Sherman's criteria. These strains were non-hemolytic, DNase+ and Ent+. The enterotoxin was purified on Sephadex G-200 column and maximum activity was observed at 37 C and pH 7.0. Enterotoxin treated with trypsin and papain elicited very poor response to fluid accumulation. The sensitivity of all the strains against different antibiotics was determined. Strain 53 M was treated with acridine orange and ethidium bromide and a total of 44 Amps Strr and 3 Amps Strs mutants were tested for toxin production. Out of these only 4 were toxin negative, amongst which 3 were also DNase negative and 1 showed partial DNase activity.

TI  - Suppurative thrombophlebitis: correlation between pathogen and underlying disease.
AB  - We identified 29 episodes of suppurative thrombophlebitis in 27 patients admitted to a large general hospital between May 1980 and May 1984. In 25 patients, the intravenous cannulae had been in place for more than 3 days. Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or one of the Enterobacteriaceae were implicated in 14 patients. All these patients had recently undergone abdominal surgery or had a major intra-abdominal inflammatory process at the time they developed thrombophlebitis. The remaining 13 patients were infected with Staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive cocci or Candida species. Only two of these had an active abdominal process at the time of their infection (chi 2 = 16.08, P less than 0.001). There is an apparent association between phlebitis caused by enteric organisms and active intra-abdominal pathology. There were two deaths related to delayed or deferred surgery. Suppurative thrombophlebitis is a lethal, preventable nosocomial infection that requires urgent surgical intervention.
TI  - Comparison of two beta-lactamase-producing strains of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A second strain of enterococcus (PA) producing beta-lactamase (Bla+ phenotype) was compared with the previously reported Bla+ enterococcus, strain HH22. As with the original strain, there was a marked inoculum effect when PA was tested with penicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin; no difference was noted with methicillin, cephalothin, imipenem, or vancomycin; the difference with ticarcillin was intermediate. High-level gentamicin resistance (Gmr) transferred from PA to an enterococcal recipient strain at a frequency approximately 100-fold lower than for HH22; all Gmr transconjugants from both strains were Bla+, but only PA showed linkage of Gmr and Bla+ with transfer of resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. EcoRI digestion of plasmid DNA from Gmr Bla+ transconjugants showed no similarities between the two strains. A 5.1-kilobase EcoRI Bla+-encoding fragment derived from HH22 was cloned into an Escherichia coli cloning vector and shown to hybridize to a 10.2-kilobase EcoRI fragment derived from PA; both fragments hybridized to an 840-base-pair staphylococcal Bla+ gene probe. These data indicate that the penicillinases are similar but encoded on different or differently arranged plasmids. The fact that both are transferable emphasizes the potential for this new streptococcal resistance determinant to disseminate.
TI  - Reconstitution of ATP-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus lactis, and Streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-D-glucoside in the presence of Escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. For reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated E. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-D-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. ATP-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was comparable to that found in parent vesicles. Recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. The properties of ATP-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. In proteoliposomes, ATP-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase. On the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microM vanadate, for S. faecalis, S. lactis, and S. sanguis, respectively. This marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an E1E2-type ion-motive pump. These data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an ATP-dependent proton circulation via the F0F1-ATPase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating ATPase. Thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an ATP-linked process analogous to the ion-motive ATPases of eukaryotic membranes.
TI  - Structural studies of a teichoic acid from Streptococcus agalactiae type III.
AB  - An unusual type of teichoic acid has been isolated from Streptococcus agalactiae  type III. It has the same backbone as the lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis, but is devoid of fatty acid residues, a phosphatidyl group, and substituents in the poly(glycerol phosphate) side-chain. The following structure, with n approximately 20, was determined mainly with the aid of n.m.r. spectroscopy. (Formula: see text)
TI  - Interactions of pyridine nucleotides with redox forms of the flavin-containing NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The flavin-containing NADH peroxidase of Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, which catalyzes the reaction: NADH + H+ + H2O2----NAD+ + 2H2O, has been purified to homogeneity in our laboratory for analyses of both its structure and redox behavior. Our findings indicate that the enzyme is a tetramer of four apparently identical subunits (Mr = 46,000/subunit), each containing one FAD coenzyme and a second non-flavin, nonmetal redox center. There is no evidence of nonequivalence among the flavins. Dithionite reduction of the enzyme occurs in two steps, with end points of 0.96 and 2.05 eq/FAD. The first step generates a two-electron reduced form of the enzyme (EH2) which is spectrally identical with that generated by aerobic addition of NADH. Our studies suggest that the long-wavelength absorbance band (lambda max approximately 540 nm) exhibited by this form results from charge-transfer interaction between the reduced non-flavin redox center and the oxidized flavin. A second type of long-wavelength charge-transfer absorbance band (lambda max approximately 770 nm) is generated on anaerobic addition of 1 eq of NADH to EH2 and results from interaction between oxidized FAD and the reduced pyridine nucleotide. Either the EH2 X NAD+ or the EH2 X NAD+ X NADH forms may be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, as both are reactive with hydrogen peroxide.
TI  - [Mycotic intracranial aneurysm in infective endocarditis of the mitral valve].
AB  - A 20-year-old woman suffering from mitral valve endocarditis due to streptococcus faecalis infection after blunt trauma and splenectomy complained of severe headache 18 days later. Cerebral angiography showed a left posterior artery aneurysm. A craniotomy was performed and the aneurysm could be successfully removed. The postoperative neurological status showed a mild transient right hemiparesis. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude-Medical prosthesis 14 days after brain surgery. The patient was in stable neurologic and hemodynamic conditions at the time of discharge 3 weeks after valve replacement.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - [Streptococcus faecalis: sensitivity to quinolones, penicillins and aminoglycosides alone or in combination].
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus faecalis are moderately susceptible to quinolones, penicillins and aminoglycosides used alone. Penicillin-aminoglycosides synergism is not observed against aminoglycosides high-level resistant strains. The combination of an aminoglycoside plus a quinolone was synergistic against susceptible strains of S. faecalis but not against aminoglycosides high-level resistant strains. No antagonistic effect of quinolones plus aminoglycosides or plus penicillin was observed.

TI  - ATP-driven calcium transport in membrane vesicles of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Calcium transport was investigated in membrane vesicles prepared from the oral bacterium Streptococcus sanguis. Procedures were devised for the preparation of membrane vesicles capable of accumulating 45Ca2+. Uptake was ATP dependent and did not require a proton motive force. Calcium transport in these vesicles was compared with 45Ca2+ accumulation in membrane vesicles from Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The data support the existence of an ATP-driven calcium pump in S. sanguis similar to that in S. faecalis. This pump, which catalyzes uptake into membrane vesicles, would be responsible for extrusion of calcium from intact cells.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone antimicrobial, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone antimicrobial, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin against selected gram-positive bacteria. Concentrations of CI-934 required to inhibit 90% of strains (MIC90) were twofold to eightfold lower than those of ciprofloxacin. With the exception of Streptococcus faecium, all isolates were inhibited by CI-934 at concentrations less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml.
TI  - Streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system: amino acid sequence and site of ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr.
AB  - The amino acid sequence of histidine-containing protein (HPr) from Streptococcus  faecalis has been determined by direct Edman degradation of intact HPr and by amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic peptides, V8 proteolytic peptides, thermolytic peptides, and cyanogen bromide cleavage products. HPr from S. faecalis was found to contain 89 amino acid residues, corresponding to a molecular weight of 9438. The amino acid sequence of HPr from S. faecalis shows extended homology to the primary structure of HPr proteins from other bacteria. Besides the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of a histidyl residue in HPr, catalyzed by enzyme I of the bacterial phosphotransferase system, HPr was also found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue in an ATP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed reaction [Deutscher, J., & Saier, M. H., Jr. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 6790-6794]. The site of ATP-dependent phosphorylation in HPr of S. faecalis has now been determined. [32P]P-Ser-HPr was digested with three different proteases, and in each case, a single labeled peptide was isolated. Following digestion with subtilisin, we obtained a peptide with the sequence -(P)Ser-Ile-Met-. Using chymotrypsin, we isolated a peptide with the sequence -Ser-Val-Asn-Leu-Lys-(P)Ser-Ile-Met-Gly-Val-Met-. The longest labeled peptide was obtained with V8 staphylococcal protease. According to amino acid analysis, this peptide contained 36 out of the 89 amino acid residues of HPr. The following sequence of 12 amino acid residues of the V8 peptide was determined: -Tyr-Lys-Gly-Lys-Ser-Val-Asn-Leu-Lys-(P)Ser-Ile-Met-.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - The microbiological utility of antibiotic combinations against Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains was studied. The drugs used were netilmicin + amoxicillin (20 strains); netilmicin + piperacillin (20 strains); netilmicin- + vancomycin (20 strains); netilmicin + rifampicin (20 strains). Netilmicin used in combination with the penicillins was advantageous against Streptococcus faecalis, but not uniformly against Streptococcus faecium. The combinations of netilmicin with vancomycin or rifampicin were no more effective than the single drugs in most cases, although the response varied for the different strains of the two species.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci. I. Inhibitory and bactericidal activity of several chemoantibiotics against Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The authors present a microbiological study of 100 strains of Enterococcus (70 strains of Streptococcus faecalis and 30 strains of Streptococcus faecium) tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics, amoxicillin, ampicillin + flucloxacillin, piperacillin, rifampicin, vancomycin, netilmicin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. The assessment of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations of these substances indicates that all have good inhibitory activity except netilmicin, which is active at higher concentrations; with rifampicin and vancomycin showing very poor bactericidal activity. The bactericidal activity of penicillins was hard to assess because of tolerance and paradoxical effect phenomena. The quinolones showed good inhibitory and bactericidal activity.
TI  - Characterization and partial purification of a broad spectrum antibiotic AS-48 produced by Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis S-48 produces a broad spectrum antibiotic, active against  Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This substance is produced in solid and liquid media and also in a defined basal medium. It is sensitive to protease, pronase, or trypsin, heating at 70 degrees C, and alkaline pH, but resistant to treatment with lipase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, DNAase, RNAase, acidic or neutral pHs, and also lower temperatures (60 degrees C). Several organic solvents cause precipitation, but not inactivation. This antibiotic has been partially purified by gel filtration and further ion-exchange chromatography. Its molecular weight has been estimated close to 2000. The biological activity of this antagonistic substance against the selected indicator strains, Streptococcus faecalis S-47 and Escherichia coli U-9, is bactericidal. The characterization of this substance, initially classified as a bacteriocin, indicates that it is an antibiotic of peptidic nature. The significance of antibiotic occurrence in group D of the genus Streptococcus is also discussed.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of netilmicin compared with gentamicin and streptomycin, alone and in combination with penicillin, against penicillin tolerant viridans streptococci and enterococci.
AB  - Netilmicin was compared with gentamicin and streptomycin for in-vitro activity against 30 strains of penicillin-tolerant streptococci including 16 strains of enterococci. Both netilmicin and gentamicin tested alone at 4 mg/l caused 99.9% kill of more than half of the 13 strains of viridans streptococci tested, whereas streptomycin, 4 mg/l, had no bactericidal effect against these strains. Netilmicin, gentamicin and streptomycin tested alone at 8.0 mg/l against 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis resulted in 99.9% kill of six, one and zero strains respectively. Combinations of penicillin with 2 mg/l of either netilmicin or gentamicin resulted in bactericidal synergy against 12 of 13 strains of viridans streptococci and all 10 strains of S. faecalis after 18 to 24 h incubation. Parallel experiments showed that higher concentration of penicillin were required to obtain 99.9% kill of 10 streptococcal strains when 4 mg/l streptomycin was compared with 2 mg/l of the other aminoglycosides. Killing curves showed similar bactericidal synergy for netilmicin-penicillin and gentamicin-penicillin combinations against most streptococci tested after 24 h incubation but there was sometimes a greater bactericidal effect noted with netilmicin after only 6 h incubation of the broth or after 48 h incubation. The results of this in-vitro study suggest that netilmicin is at least as effective as gentamicin as a bactericidal synergic agent with penicillin against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and S. faecalis strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. Neither gentamicin or netilmicin were effective as bactericidal synergic agents with penicillin against 4 of 6 strains of S. faecium tested.
TI  - Identification of pheromone-induced surface proteins in Streptococcus faecalis and evidence of a role for lipoteichoic acid in formation of mating aggregates.
AB  - The conjugative transfer of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1 is characterized by a 10,000-fold increase in frequency following sex pheromone (cAD1) induction. Before the increase in plasmid transfer, donor cells synthesize a proteinaceous adhesin that facilitates the formation of mating aggregates. Four novel surface proteins appearing after exposure of pAD1-containing cells to sex pheromone have been identified. Thirty minutes after induction, a 130-kilodalton (kDa) protein was detectable by Western blotting. A 74-kDa protein, the major species present, and a pair of bands at 153 and 157 kDa were evident 45 min after induction. Induced cells containing another conjugative S. faecalis plasmid, pPD1, gave rise to three high-molecular-weight proteins of the same size (130, 153, and 157 kDa) as those synthesized by pAD1-containing cells. These proteins cross-reacted with antisera raised against induced cells containing pAD1. However, the major protein species produced by pPD1-containing cells had a molecular weight of 78,000 and did not cross-react significantly with the corresponding band of the pAD1 system. Pheromone-induced transfer of the two plasmids, when both were present in the same cell, was independent; induction was limited to the pheromone-specified plasmid. The possibility that lipoteichoic acid might act as a receptor (binding substance) for the induced adhesin protein was also explored. Free lipoteichoic acid (isolated from S. faecalis) inhibited clumping of induced cells, apparently by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the cellular binding substance.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of LY 146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY 146032, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic belonging to  the class of agents designated A21978C, was compared with those of vancomycin, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against selected gram-positive bacteria. The new drug inhibited all staphylococcal isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The activity of LY 146032 was comparable to that of vancomycin against most streptococci, but the latter demonstrated greater potency against Streptococcus faecium and penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci and viridans group streptococci. LY 146032 was markedly less active than vancomycin against Listeria monocytogenes (MICs for 90% of strains tested, 16 and 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively). The activity of LY 146032 was enhanced as the concentration of calcium in the test medium was increased. MBCs were within eightfold of the MIC for each of 12 strains tested. In a rat model of enterococcal endocarditis, the administration of LY 146032 resulted in increased survival and a reduction in the bacterial titer within cardiac vegetations compared with untreated control animals.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin.
AB  - Teicoplanin (0.2 g) or vancomycin (1 g) were infused over 3 and 50 min respectively to six male volunteers in a cross-over study. Each drug was administered twice at a 14 h interval. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were accurately described using a two-compartment model. Vancomycin had a shorter half-life (5.8 +/- 1.8 h) compared to teicoplainin (33.2 +/- 5.1 h; P less than 0.001). One hour serum was tested for serum bactericidal activity against ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus (median serum bactericidal activity 1:16 for teicoplanin; 1:32 for vancomycin), Staph. epidermidis (1:32 for teicoplanin and for vancomycin) and Streptococcus faecalis (1:2 for both drugs). Serum killing rate studies showed a slower rate of killing of Staph. aureus with teicoplanin (less than 1 log10 cfu/ml over 6 h) than with vancomycin (4 log10 cfu/ml over 6 h).
TI  - Isolation and structure of the Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone, cAM373.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone, cAM373, which induces a mating response of donor cells harboring plasmid pAM373 and is also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, was isolated and its structure determined. Supernatant from an overnight culture of a recipient strain was subjected to successive purification procedures, and 4.4 micrograms cAM373 was obtained. The isolated pheromone showed activity at a concentration as low as 5 X 10(-11) M. Sequence analysis indicated that cAM373 was a heptapeptide, H-Ala-Ile-Phe-Ile-Leu-Ala-Ser-OH, and that its Mr was 733. A synthetic replicate of the peptide showed the same biological activity and chromatographic behavior as the native cAM373.
TI  - Conjugal plasmid transfer (pAM beta 1) in Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred via conjugation from Streptococcus faecalis to Lactobacillus plantarum and was transferred among L. plantarum strains. Streptococcus sanguis Challis was transformed with pAM beta 1 isolated from these transconjugants, and transformants harboring intact pAM beta 1 could conjugate the plasmid back to L. plantarum.
TI  - Effect of organotins on fecal pollution indicator organisms.
AB  - Pure cultures of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis and environmental water samples were examined for the possibility that pollution involving organotin compounds could decrease the values for indicator organisms when standard methods were applied to the analysis of water samples. (CH3)2SnCl2 and (CH3)3SnCl decreased viable counts at about 10 to 100 mg of Sn liter-1 (8.4 X 10(-5) to 8.4 X 10(-4) mol of Sn liter-1), and tributyltin chloride was effective at about 0.1 to 1.0 mg of Sn liter-1 (8.4 X 10(-7) to 8.4 X 10(-6) mol of Sn liter-1. These concentrations, particularly for the methyltin compounds, are greater than the concentrations reported to date for these compounds in aquatic ecosystems. Thus, organotin compounds alone would not be likely to cause reductions in counts of indicator organisms measured by standard methods. However, it is suggested that, when combined with other environmental stressors or upon long exposure, organotins such as butyltins may contribute to the injury of indicator organisms.
TI  - Intermittent hyperbaric oxygen therapy for reduction of mortality in experimental polymicrobial sepsis.
AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has a marked beneficial effect in experimental intraabdominal sepsis. Two rat models involving implantation of either rat fecal material or a mixture of pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were used in this study. A death rate of 100% was obtained in control animals implanted with fecal material; with intermittent hyperbaric oxygen treatment, a death rate of only 8% was observed (P less than .005). With a mixture of pure cultures of clinical pathogens, the death rate in control animals was 79%, and intermittent hyperbaric oxygen treatment reduced the rate to 23% (P less than .005). Data from cultures of blood indicated that the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen was not related to antibacterial activity.
TI  - Control of enzyme synthesis in the oxalurate catabolic pathway of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 11700: evidence for the existence of a third carbamate kinase.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 11700 uses oxalurate as a sole energy source for growth. An oxamate carbamoyltransferase and a carbamate kinase, both induced by oxalurate, are involved in this process. The oxalurate-induced kinase is specific for the pathway. Its properties are different from those of the previously characterized agmatine and arginine-induced kinases. Glucose, but not arginine, nor agmatine, two other energy sources, represses the oxalurate pathway. In contrast, oxalurate was found to be at least as effective as glucose in repressing the arginine deiminase pathway in arginine grown cells, or the agmatine deiminase pathway during growth on agmatine.
TI  - Potent antagonism of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium,  and Enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - Interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae serogroup non O1, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (MCM). Potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. The four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. The seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. Sh. Flexneri and Staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of E. coli alone. C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae serogroup non O1 were excluded in the presence of E. coli with B. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. S. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. When the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, C. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. Sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Rate of bactericidal activity for Streptococcus faecalis of a new quinolone, CI-934, compared with that of amoxicillin.
AB  - The rate of bactericidal activity of a new quinolone, CI-934, was compared with that of amoxicillin for 20 strains of Streptococcus faecalis. At 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, the bactericidal activity of CI-934 was more rapid at 6 h than that of amoxicillin. A paradoxical effect (a killing rate higher at 1 microgram/ml than at 100 micrograms/ml at 6 h) was observed for 19 of the 20 strains with amoxicillin and for 1 of the 20 strains with CI-934. It remains to be demonstrated whether in vivo studies will confirm the results obtained in vitro.

TI  - An evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  - Three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. The use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. In general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene specifying the bifunctional 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase enzyme in Streptococcus faecalis and identification and cloning of gene regions specifying the two activities.
AB  - The gene specifying the bifunctional 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase [AAC(6')] 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase [APH(2")] enzyme from the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pIP800 was cloned in Escherichia coli. A single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 was specified by this cloned determinant as detected in minicell experiments. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame capable of specifying a protein of 479 amino acids and with a molecular weight of 56,850. The deduced amino acid sequence of the bifunctional AAC(6')-APH(2") gene product possessed two regions of homology with other sequenced resistance proteins. The N-terminal region contained a sequence that was homologous to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase of Bacillus pumilus, and the C-terminal region contained a sequence homologous to the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of Streptomyces fradiae. Subcloning experiments were performed with the AAC(6')-APH(2") resistance determinant, and it was possible to obtain gene segments independently specifying the acetyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities. These data suggest that the gene specifying the AAC(6')-APH(2") resistance enzyme arose as a result of a gene fusion.
TI  - Chromosomal insertions of Tn917 in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - We describe 46 insertions of the Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 into the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis. These insertion mutations were mapped genetically. Some caused auxotrophic requirements, and others were cryptic. These insertions were scattered around the B. subtilis chromosome. The mutant strains were useful in several ways for mapping and cloning B. subtilis genes and were added to the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center collection. Among the auxotrophic markers were a new serine auxotrophy and deletion-insertions that caused auxotrophy in one case for homoserine and threonine, in another case for uracil and either cysteine or methionine, and in a third case for leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
TI  - Use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  - The results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus Enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans, E. hirae, E. avium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, E. malodoratus and E. mundtii. Each species had a specific pattern of at least five PBPs, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kDa. The pattern of PBPs may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.

TI  - Heterogeneity of plasmids determining high-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Between November 1981 and October 1984, 48 of 3,458 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis at the University of Michigan Hospital showed high-level (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) resistance to gentamicin, as well as to all other clinically available aminoglycosides. Thirteen percent of clinical isolates in the University of Michigan Hospital currently demonstrate this level of resistance. Transfer of resistance to a plasmid-free streptococcal recipient was observed in filter matings for 44 of 48 such isolates. Analysis of transconjugants by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that gentamicin resistance was transferred alone in 8 isolates and was combined with other antimicrobial resistances on the same plasmid in the other 36 isolates. There were seven isolates which transferred the property of horse blood beta-hemolysis along with gentamicin resistance. Transfer of gentamicin resistance was either by conjugative plasmids or by a nonconjugative but mobilizable plasmid. Transfer frequencies on filters ranged from 4.7 X 10(-2) to 4.1 X 10(-8). Based on donor and transconjugant antibiotic resistance markers, agarose gel electrophoresis, transfer properties, and restriction enzyme analysis, the plasmid content of transconjugants was heterogeneous and could be classified into at least seven different patterns. These findings argue against clonal dissemination as the cause of the increased frequency of resistant strains and suggest that resistance to gentamicin appears on a variety of physically distinct conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids in S. faecalis.
TI  - Susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: E. coli (n = 50), Enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and streptococci (n = 51). The results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. Considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.
TI  - Modulation of complement fixation and the phlogistic capacity of group A, B, and  D streptococci by human lysozyme acting on their cell walls.
AB  - Streptococci and streptococcal cell wall fragments induce arthritis in rats, with the severity and duration depending on the capacity of the cells or cell fragments to resist degradation by tissue enzymes. Their phlogogenic effects are apparently related to their ability to activate the alternate complement pathway (ACP). The in vitro activation of the ACP by lysozyme-treated cells and cell walls of group A, B, and D streptococci suggests that both rat and human lysozyme can modulate this activity, i.e., increasing it, decreasing it, or doing both in that order. The effects of the lysozymes also correlated with the degree to which they can unmask the aminosugar-reducing groups detectable in a given amount of cell wall, which suggests that partial depolymerization of the cell wall is critical for ACP activation. The effects of mutanolysin and C phage lysin on ACP activation were found to be correlated with their action on streptococcal cell walls. Neuraminidase had relatively little effect on ACP activation by most streptococcal strains tested. We conclude that the participation of tissue enzymes, including but not necessarily limited to lysozyme, is an important determinant for the clinical arthritis induced by group A, B, or D streptococci. Experimental arthritis induced in rats with whole (or disrupted) streptococci may depend both on the capacities of the cell walls to activate the ACP and on the capacities of the host tissue enzymes to modulate this activation. Great severity and long durations of the disease were determined by the capacity of the enzymes to degrade cell wall antigens to a degree sufficient to ensure efficient activation of the ACP without completely degrading the material so that it no longer activates complement. In this model, the limited resistance of group B peptidoglycan to lysozyme was a critical pathogenic factor.
TI  - High-level resistance to gentamicin in Streptococcus faecalis: risk factors and evidence for exogenous acquisition of infection.
AB  - Between November 1981 and October 1984, 48 of 3,456 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis that were studied showed high-level (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) resistance to gentamicin. A case-control study comparing patients with gentamicin-susceptible (MIC less than 64 micrograms/ml) and -resistant S. faecalis infections showed significant associations (P less than .01) between the development of infection with highly gentamicin-resistant S. faecalis and prior antimicrobial therapy (particularly with cephalosporins or aminoglycosides), perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, prior surgical procedures, and longer hospitalization. All highly resistant strains appeared to be nosocomial since 12 cases were clustered on a surgical floor and in a burn unit. In vitro transfer of gentamicin resistance by filter mating was observed for 44 of 48 isolates. The use of plasmid content as an epidemiological marker suggested nosocomial transmission and exogenous acquisition of S. faecalis.
TI  - Structure of a conjugative element in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of Streptococcus pneumoniae DP1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from S. pneumoniae BM6001. This element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. Location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain Rx1 recipient genome. This target site was preferred by both the BM6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from Streptococcus agalactiae B109. Within the BM6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain Rx1 DNA. Another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the BM6001 element and at two places in the Rx1 genome. Its role is unknown. The ends of the BM6001 element appear to be the same as those of the B109 element, both as seen after transfer to S. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pDP5 after transposition in Streptococcus faecalis. We see no homology between the ends of the BM6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.
TI  - Stimulation of dihydroxyacetone and glycerol kinase activity in Streptococcus faecalis by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation catalyzed by enzyme I and HPr of the phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Recently we reported the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphorylation of a 55-kilodalton protein of Streptococcus faecalis catalyzed by enzyme I and histidine-containing protein (HPr) of the phosphotransferase system (J. Deutscher, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 29:237-243, 1985). The purified 55-kilodalton protein was found to exhibit dihydroxyacetone kinase activity. Glycerol was six times more slowly phosphorylated than dihydroxyacetone. The Kms were found to be 0.7 mM for ATP, 0.45 mM for dihydroxyacetone, and 0.9 mM for glycerol. PEP-dependent phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone kinase stimulated phosphorylation of both substrates about 10-fold. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate at concentrations higher than 2 mM inhibited the activity of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated dihydroxyacetone kinase in a noncompetitive manner. The rate of PEP-dependent phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone kinase was about 200-fold slower than the phosphorylation rate of III proteins (also called enzyme III or factor III), which so far have been considered the only phosphoryl acceptors of histidyl-phosphorylated HPr. P-Dihydroxyacetone kinase was found to be able to transfer its phosphoryl group in a backward reaction to HPr. Following [32P]PEP-dependent phosphorylation and tryptic digestion of dihydroxyacetone kinase, we isolated a labeled peptide composed of 37 amino acids, as determined by amino acid analysis. The single histidyl residue of this peptide most likely carries the phosphoryl group in phosphorylated dihydroxyacetone kinase.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Evaluations of tyrosine apodecarboxylase assays for pyridoxal phosphate.
AB  - The alternate procedures used in the tyrosine apodecarboxylase assays for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were evaluated to determine optimal conditions. Two preparations of tyrosine apodecarboxylase from Streptococcus faecalis were used: a cell suspension and a partially purified cell-free form. The activity of the decarboxylase was measured in two different assays using [14C]tyrosine or [3H]tyrosine as substrate. The presence of serum proteins caused greater inhibition of the assay for serum pyridoxal phosphate using [14C]tyrosine as substrate than the assay with [3H]tyrosine. In contrast, addition of deproteinized serum extract did not appear to inhibit either assay. The rate of reconstitution of the apodecarboxylase in the cell suspension was at least four times slower than that of the cell-free enzyme. The rate of reconstitution of the cell-free enzyme was faster in acetate than in citrate buffer. Inorganic sulfate or phosphate, at normal plasma concentrations, did not alter either the reconstitution rate of tyrosine decarboxylase or the final activity obtained in the assays using either substrate. The tyrosine apodecarboxylase assay for pyridoxal phosphate can be optimized by using deproteinized sera or plasma and incubating the cell-free apoenzyme with the coenzyme in acetate buffer for a time sufficient to obtain maximum reconstitution.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Enhancement of Streptococcus faecalis infection and complement depletion in yeast-treated mice.
AB  - Enhancement of Streptococcus faecalis infection and lowering of the complement level have been demonstrated in mice injected with a heat-treated suspension of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The leucocyte response to the infection was not affected. The yeast preparation showed, in vitro, an intense anti-complementary activity on mouse serum and interfered with the microbial killing function of the mouse peritoneal macrophages. No significant stimulation of the growth of S. faecalis in vitro in the presence of the yeast was observed. The enhancement of the infection in mice treated with the yeast seems to be mediated, mainly, by complement depletion.
TI  - Identification and partial purification of a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A dipeptidyl aminopeptidase was identified in Streptococcus faecalis JH2SS and was partially purified (approximately 245-fold) by HPLC. Gel filtration chromatography indicated an Mr of 140 000. The partially purified enzyme exhibited a requirement for Co2+. The pH optimum for the hydrolysis of L-Val-L-Ala-p-nitroanilide was approximately 9.5. The apparent Km for this substrate was 0.22 mM. The enzyme preferentially hydrolysed X-Ala-Y substrates, but also utilized X-Pro-Y substrates, and therefore is most closely related to the mammalian dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II (EC 3.4.14.-). The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, but not by iodoacetate, N-ethylmaleimide or the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride.
TI  - A survived case of diabetic nonclostridial gas gangrene and the review of the literatures on microbiological findings.
AB  - Nonclostridial gas gangrene in diabetics results in poor prognosis. In this paper, a survived case of diabetic nonclostridial gas gangrene caused by Proteus vulgaris and Streptococcus faecalis is described and microbiological findings of 31 cases of the literatures including our own case were reviewed. Twenty of 31 cases died (64.5%). The microbiological findings in 30 cases revealed an average of 1.8 organism per case. Predominant aerobes were E. Coli (56.7%), Streptococcus faecalis (16.7%), aerobic Streptococcus and Proteus (both 13.3%) in that order. Anaerobes were found in 12 of 20 cases and isolated anaerobes were Bacteroides (8 cases) and Peptococcus (4 cases). The role of specific bacteria in causing severe form of nonclostridial gas gangrene in diabetics was suggested.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity of group D and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of Group D streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and API Strep. Streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. constellatus (S. milleri). One of the two isolates of S. faecium was a contamination. The reported increasing frequency of this organism and other Group D and viridans streptococci as well as the association of S. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. Pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (SAT) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. In the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.
TI  - Effect of amiloride on the intracellular sodium and potassium content of intact Streptococcus faecalis cells in vitro.
AB  - Amiloride at millimolar concentrations caused marked changes in the growth-dependent intracellular balance of Na+ and K+ in Streptococcus faecalis. These results, whether specific to transport processes or resulting from indirect yet unknown mechanisms, constitute the first evidence of an effect of amiloride on bacterial electrolytes.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis orbital cellulitis.
AB  - A case of orbital cellulitis in which the causative organism was Streptococcus faecalis--the first such case to the authors' knowledge--is reported. Although Hemophilus influenzae and pneumococci are most frequently encountered in orbital cellulitis, this case shows that Streptococcus faecalis may also be responsible. Prompt identification of the bacteria is urged.
TI  - Identification of regions of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pCF-10 that encode antibiotic resistance and pheromone response functions.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pCF-10 (58 kb) of Streptococcus faecalis has been mapped  with restriction enzymes. By restriction mapping and Southern hybridization analysis, a 16-kb segment of the plasmid was shown to resemble closely the conjugative tetracycline resistance transposon, Tn916. Mutagenesis of the plasmid with the erythromycin resistance transposon Tn917 was used to localize a tetracycline resistance determinant and several regions involved in conjugal transfer. Fifty Tn917 insertions (outside the region of the plasmid homologous to Tn916) affecting mating behavior and the ability of donor cells to respond to the sex pheromone cCF-10 were mapped to nine distinct segments, or tra regions. Insertions into tra regions 1-3 and 7-9 led to an enhanced transfer ability of mutant plasmids relative to the transfer frequency obtained for the wild-type plasmid. Cells carrying these mutant plasmids differed in colony morphology or growth in broth culture from cells carrying pCF-10. Insertions into tra regions 4-6 resulted in reduced plasmid transfer, or completely eliminated the mating potential of donor cells. Insertions generating transfer-defective plasmids could be grouped further according to the ability of strains harboring the mutant plasmids to respond to cCF-10. HindIII fragments of pCF-10 coding for transfer functions have been cloned into Escherichia coli.
TI  - Differential scanning calorimetry of bacteria.
AB  - Thermograms obtained by differential scanning calorimetry of a range of bacteria  of different heat resistances were compared. Equations were derived to calculate the rate at which the numbers of viable organisms in a calorimeter decline as the temperature is raised at a constant rate. Vegetative bacteria scanned at 10 degrees C min-1 showed multi-peaked thermograms with four major peaks (denoted m, n, p and q) occurring in the regions 68-73, 77-84, 89-99 and 105-110 degrees C respectively. Exceptions were that peak m (the largest peak) occurred at 79-82 degrees C in Bacillus stearothermophilus and an additional peak, r, was detected in Escherichia coli at 119 degrees C. At temperatures below the main peak m there were major differences in thermograms between species. There was a direct relationship between the onset of thermal denaturation and the thermoresistance of different organisms. Heat-sensitive organisms displayed thermogram features which were absent in the more heat-resistant types. When samples were cooled to 5 degrees C and re-heated, a small endothermic peak, pr, was observed at the same temperature as p. Peaks p and pr were identified as the melting endotherms of DNA. In all vegetative organisms examined, maximum death rates, computed from published D and z values, occurred at temperatures above the onset of thermal denaturation, i.e. cell death and irreversible denaturation of cell components occurred within the same temperature range.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens involved in sex pheromone induced  mating in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies to Streptococcus faecalis cell surface antigens were constructed. Some of the antibodies isolated were directed against surface components involved in pheromone-induced mating. This paper describes the use of the monoclonal antibodies to identify antigenically related surface components detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, their use in pheromone response assays, and their use as functional inhibitors in mating experiments.
TI  - Enterocin typing of enterococci isolated from dried infant foods.
AB  - One hundred and fifty enterococcal isolates recovered from 16 market samples of infant foods and 35 from other sources were characterized and subjected to enterocin typing with 18 indicator strains. Among 150 enterococcal isolates, 114 (76%) were able to be typed by the indicator strains. Although 24 enterocin patterns were observed with these enterococci, the most prevalent types were X-9, 224, and 65-603. Occurrence of pattern X-9 either singly or in combination with many other types was most frequent. Many of the enterocin patterns in enterococcal isolates were recovered from samples of dairy water supply and hand washings of personnel working in a dairy plant that manufactured infant food; this suggests the possibility of these as sources of contamination. Enterocin typing of enterococci could prove useful in epidemiological studies.
TI  - The diffusion of pefloxacin into bone and the treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Pefloxacin was evaluated in the treatment of bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 15 patients with chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Serratia sp., 1 Proteus mirabilis, and a mixed infection with a Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). Patients were given pefloxacin 400 mg 12-hourly iv for 48 h followed by oral treatment. Bone biopsies from the iliac crest were carried out after at least seven days treatment, 2 h after the last dose. Serum levels were estimated at the same time. In 13 patients the pefloxacin levels were between 2 and 10 mg per g of bone and always greater than, or equal to, the MIC for the infecting organism. In 11 patients treated for six months and followed up for up to 14 months after the completion of treatment, the therapy was successful. In another two patients, the results were excellent with closure of fistulae, but there was only limited follow-up. There were two failures: in one (post-radiation osteitis) the infection persisted and in the other there was intolerance of the antimicrobial. In both cases there was no increase in the MIC of pefloxacin against the organisms. Three patients underwent operations for orthopaedic indications, after at least two months of treatment. Bone cultures from the initial focus remained sterile. Side-effects were mild.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - Comparative study of selective media for enumeration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from water by membrane filtration.
AB  - In the present study, mPA-D and mPA-E agar, modifications of mPA-C agar that reduce background fecal streptococci that interfere with the differentiation and enumeration of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies grown in other mPA media, are proposed for use in analyzing natural water samples. In addition, the efficiencies of several culture media for the recovery of P. aeruginosa in water after membrane filtration and multiple-tube techniques are compared. The degree of selectivity, precision, efficiency, and sensitivity achieved with the proposed media exceeded that achieved by current methods. Furthermore, they yielded equal rates of accuracy and specificity. Incubation at 36 degrees C resulted in an improved recovery of stressed P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, we propose the use of mPA-D and mPA-E agar, both incubated at 36 degrees C for 24 to 48 h, for analyzing river water and seawater, respectively.
TI  - [A study on the antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid--the significance of intraamniotic transferrin].
AB  - In order to study the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid, attempts were made to evaluate the in vivo growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid and the role of transferrin in antibacterial activity. The bacteria chosen for these experiments were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, respectively. The results obtained were as follows: Amniotic fluid was shown have an antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. Individual difference in each sample appeared to be responsible for the inconsistent potency of the inhibitory effect observed. When amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, the antibacterial activity was lost. The level of transferrin in amniotic fluid obtained at term was determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6mg/dl (N = 90). The value correlated with neither those measured in cord sera nor maternal sera. The antimicrobial activity was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250mg/dl or higher. Simultaneous addition of transferrin and a sufficient concentration of iron made it possible to form a transferrin-iron complex. A subsequent decrease in unbound transferrin resulted in the loss of antibacterial properties.
TI  - Escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. In vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  - The first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. Removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. To develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence screening assay, we studied the adherence of Escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. The results can be summarized as follows: Although E. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). Agents which did not effect E. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. Agents which inhibited E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited E. coli adherence to the resin. Similar to the effect of heparin on E. coli attachment, the adherence of Klebsiella ozaene, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. These studies indicate that the adherence of E. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - Isolation and properties of an H2O-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - An H2O-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis, recently described [Hoskins, D. D., Whiteley, H. R. and Mackler, B. (1962) J. Biol. Chem. 237, 2647-2651], has been isolated as a uniform protein with specific activity 690 U/mg in a total yield of 50% by a two-step affinity chromatography procedure. The enzyme is metal-free and has a molecular mass of about 51 000 Da and probably consists of a single polypeptide chain. As shown by fluorimetric titration, the prosthetic group is 1 mol FAD/mol protein. The affinity behaviour of the enzyme gives evidence for the existence of a dinucleotide-binding domain capable of binding NADH or FAD. The enzyme is specific for NADH (Km = 4.1 X 10(-5) M), NADPH is not oxidized. O2 is the preferred electron acceptor, in addition FAD and, very slowly, one-electron acceptors are reduced. It is not clear whether the reduction of FAD proceeds through the dinucleotide-binding site or by exchange of the prosthetic group. The stoichiometry of the reaction with O2 corresponds to the consumption of 2 mol NADH/mol O2, and only H2O is formed (2 NADH + 2 H+ + O2----2 NAD+ + 2 H2O). Neither H2O2 nor O2.- is detected as intermediate and H2O2 cannot replace O2 as an oxidant. The enzyme can, mainly in its reduced state, be inhibited by -SH reagents. Spectral data give no evidence for the existence of radical intermediates during reduction. The enzyme can obviously accept more than two electrons/mol. On the basis of these data two possible reaction mechanisms are discussed. A proposal for the biological purpose of the reaction is made.
TI  - Broad geographical distribution of homologous erythromycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin resistance determinants among group D streptococci of human and animal origin.
AB  - The Emr, Kmr, and Smr determinants of the Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1 were cloned in Streptococcus sanguis with a streptococcal plasmid vector, pVA380-1. Each cloned determinant was used as a probe in hybridization reactions with dot blots containing plasmid-enriched DNA from 91 group D streptococcal isolates resistant to erythromycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin; the isolates were obtained from animal and human sources in a variety of geographical locations. Nearly 70% of the strains contained DNA that hybridized to each of the three resistance determinants from pJH1. Five plasmids mediating resistance to erythromycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin were examined in more detail. These plasmids varied in size between 26 and 105 kilobase pairs (kbp) and exhibited very different EcoRI restriction patterns. However, each plasmid contained the resistance determinants on a single 13- to 20-kbp EcoRI fragment. Southern blot hybridizations and additional restriction endonuclease digests revealed extensive DNA sequence homology and virtually indistinguishable restriction endonuclease maps within a 9- to 11-kbp region of each plasmid which included the resistance determinants.
TI  - The vanadate-sensitive ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis pumps potassium in a reconstituted system.
AB  - The vanadate-sensitive ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis, purified to homogeneity, was reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles in a functional state. Freeze-fracture electron micrographs revealed a relatively uniform population of unilamellar liposomes of 50-100 nm in diameter, with particles protruding from both fracture faces. Transport studies with 42K+ and with a K+-selective electrode showed that the ATP-ase catalyzes electrogenic potassium extrusion in proteoliposomes. The following parameters for potassium transport in the reconstituted system were determined: K+/ATP stoichiometry = 1, Km for potassium = 1.4 mM, Vmax = 0.1 mumol/min/mg. The ATPase could be activated by an electrical membrane potential, vesicle interior positive. This ATPase thus appears to function as a potential regulated, ATP-driven pump that serves in electrogenic potassium accumulation by the bacterial cell.

TI  - Forms of human milk folacin and variation patterns.
AB  - The pattern of folacin in 180 human milk samples collected from 16 women was studied before and after pteroylglutamic hydroxylase (conjugase) treatment. The differential response of Lactobacillus casei versus Streptococcus faecalis distinguishes N-5-methyltetrahydrofolate from other forms. Growth of Pediococcus cerevisiae differentiates the reduced monoglutamates, other than the N-5-methylated derivative, from oxidized folacins. Mean folacin activity with L. casei was 85.3 ng/ml. Prior to conjugase treatment of samples, mean activity was 46.9 ng/ml with this organism. The responses of S. faecalis and P. cerevisiae were 48% and 7.6%, respectively, of the total L. casei active folacins. The total L. casei active folacins increased from 76.5 ng/ml at 6 weeks of lactation to 97.1 ng/ml at 12 weeks of lactation. Increases were also observed with time of day: from morning (65.7 ng/ml), to afternoon (80.0 ng/ml), and to evening (114.7 ng/ml). Hindmilk had greater total L. casei activity (100.0 ng/ml) than foremilk (73.8 ng/ml). Although folacins active for S. faecalis and P. cerevisiae were not affected by duration of lactation, increases in folacin activity with time of day and from fore- to hindmilk were observed using both of these organisms. Values for the folacin content of human milk are therefore dependent on sampling procedures. Pteroylpolyglutamates of greater than or equal to 3 glutamic acid residues and N-5-methyltetrahydrofolate are the predominant forms of human milk folacin based on differential growth responses of L. casei, S. faecalis, and P. cerevisiae to these forms.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of Streptococcus faecalis and identification of its glycoprotein antigens by ligand blotting with lectins.
AB  - The antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of Streptococcus  faecalis was studied by immunoblotting of whole cells and cell walls from sodium-dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels on to nitrocellulose and detection with serum from patients and hyperimmune rabbit serum. A major envelope protein antigen of mol. wt 53 X 10(3) detected with patient's serum was also present in three urinary strains of Str. faecalis and a laboratory strain of Str. faecalis ss. zymogenes but not in Staphylococcus aureus. Other common antigens of Str. faecalis were of mol. wt (10(3)) 65, 63, 56, 49.5, 30 and 21. Two other protein antigens (43 and 37 X 10(3) mol. wt) reacted strongly with asparagus pea lectin-peroxidase conjugate indicating the presence of fucosyl residues. Other lectin-peroxidase conjugates were used to demonstrate the presence of various glycosyl residues on envelope proteins. Growth of Str. faecalis in serum to mimic in-vivo growth conditions in endocarditis infections dramatically altered the antigenic patterns. Only two major antigens of mol. wt (10(3)) 56 and 53 reacted with sera from endocarditis patients. These antigens may, therefore, be of diagnostic or protective potential.
TI  - Highly efficient protoplast transformation system for Streptococcus faecalis and  a new Escherichia coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector.
AB  - A highly efficient protoplast transformation system for Streptococcus faecalis has been developed by systematically optimizing different parameters. Up to 10(6) transformants per micrograms of DNA were consistently obtained within 3 days, and cell wall regeneration of protoplasts was virtually 100%. A systematic search for useful vectors showed that the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 could transform S. faecalis at a high frequency (6.3 X 10(4) transformants per microgram). By combining a high-copy-number derivative of pIP501, designated pGB354, with the Escherichia coli vector pACYC184, we constructed a new E. coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector (pAM401) having nine unique restriction sites. In a shotgun cloning experiment, we ligated a tetracycline resistance determinant from Streptococcus sanguis chromosomal DNA into pAM401 by direct transformation of S. faecalis, establishing the utility of the protoplast transformation system and of the new shuttle vector.
TI  - Identification of a Streptococcus sanguis receptor for salivary agglutinins.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize a fraction from oral streptococci containing receptor activity for salivary agglutinin molecules. Several species and strains of streptococci were disrupted in a Ribi press. The supernatant was nuclease-treated and subjected to differential centrifugation. Receptor activity in the fractions was measured by the inhibition of saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation. In addition, bacterial strains were tested for their ability to aggregate and to deplete saliva of agglutinin activity. Three patterns of activity were observed: Streptococcus sanguis M5 depleted saliva of agglutinin activity and aggregated well; Streptococcus sanguis CC5A depleted saliva of agglutinin but did not aggregate well; and Streptococcus faecalis S-161 neither depleted saliva of agglutinin nor did it aggregate. The 105,000 g supernatant fractions derived from Ribi-disrupted Streptococcus sanguis M5 and CC5A, but not from Streptococcus faecalis, showed dose-dependent inhibition of saliva-mediated aggregation. This inhibitory activity was non-dialyzable, had the same heat and trypsin sensitivity as that seen with intact bacteria, and was not due to enzymatic digestion of the salivary agglutinin. Iso-electric focusing revealed a single active region with a pI of 5.5 which was clearly separated from the bulk of the bacterial proteins.
TI  - Streptococcal tetracycline resistance mediated at the level of protein synthesis.
AB  - The mechanism of tetracycline resistance was examined in strains containing each  of the three previously identified resistance determinants in Streptococcus spp. Uptake of tetracycline was measured in tetracycline-sensitive cells as well as in cells containing each of the three resistance determinants. In cells containing tetL, uptake was not observed. However, in sensitive cells and cells containing either tetM or tetN, tetracycline was accumulated approximately 25-fold against a concentration gradient. Furthermore, there was no evidence for modification of intracellular tetracycline recovered from sensitive, tetM, or tetN cells. Protein synthesis in extracts derived from organisms containing tetM or tetN was resistant to tetracycline. In contrast, extracts of sensitive and tetL cells were sensitive to tetracycline.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Streptococcal cytoplasmic pH is regulated by changes in amount and activity of a  proton-translocating ATPase.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis H+-ATPase (F1 X F0 complex) level was elevated when the cytoplasmic pH was shifted below 7.5. The elevated level was attained by the increase in functional unit (F1 X F0 complex) in membranes, but not by the activation of the enzyme. Our data strongly suggested that the increase in enzyme arises from stimulation of enzyme biosynthesis. When calls growing at pH 7.6 were transferred to an acid medium with a pH below 7, the amount of H+-ATPase increased. The amount of H+-ATPase decreased to the basal level when the medium was alkalized again. Cytoplasmic pH was not controlled normally in cells where a change in the amount of H+-ATPase was inhibited. Based on these findings and previous data (Kobayashi, H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 72-76), we propose a model for the regulatory mechanism of streptococcal cytoplasmic pH: the pH is regulated by changes in amount and activity of the H+-ATPase, which are dependent on the cytoplasmic pH.
TI  - [A case of splenic abscess in a drug addict with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].
AB  - The complex diagnostic procedure involved in a case of splenic abscess in a young drug addict as a result of septicaemia caused by streptococcus fascalis is described and discussed with an examination of the criteria in support of a more aggressive approach to the removal of septic foci in such patients with AIDS. It is concluded that such criteria are valid even when, as in the case described, splenectomy further depresses the immune system.
TI  - [Association of bacterial endocarditis and alcoholic cirrhosis in 9 patients].
AB  - Ten cases of bacterial endocarditis were observed in cirrhotic patients. In 7 cases, endocarditis was due to group D Streptococcus, 5 of which were Streptococcus D. bovis. Special features were the involvement of tricuspid valve and the involvement of two or more valves in 4 cases. Surgery was necessary in the acute phase in 5 patients: cure was definitely obtained in 8 cases after a particularly long interval. A colonic lesion could have been the portal of entry in some cases. Liver cirrhosis was considered as a predisposing factor for bacterial endocarditis, especially due to group D Streptococcus or to other bacteria of intestinal origin. This is probably related to the frequency of the colonic origin of group D Streptococcus endocarditis. Loss of filter function of the liver may partly explain the features of these forms of endocarditis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of primycin against multiple strains of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Crystalline primycin was found to be very active in broth dilution assay against  Staphylococcus aureus (50 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (77 strains), Streptococcus faecalis (76 strains) and one strain of Listeria monocytogenes with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml. The activity was influenced by the pH of the liquid medium with greater activity (lower MICs) at pH 8 against the majority of strains, than at pH 6 or 7.3. In disc agar diffusion assay Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 proved more sensitive than staphylococcus strains.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Effects of norfloxacin on the faecal flora in patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The effects on the long-term use of norfloxacin, a fluorinated 4-quinolone, on the intestinal flora (both aerobic and anaerobic), were evaluated in patients suffering from recurrent complicated urinary tract infections. Eight patients received norfloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. for three months, and 11 patients received 400 mg b.i.d. for one month, and then 400 mg as an evening dose for two months. The concentration of Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis, and yeasts in stool specimens, together with the norfloxacin concentration were measured every month. The beta-aspartyl-glycine test was carried out at the same time. No urinary tract infections, either of exogenous (Pseudomonas spp.) or endogenous origin could be diagnosed during norfloxacin therapy. At both dosages of norfloxacin the faecal samples were free of Enterobacteriaceae due to low minimal bactericidal concentrations and high faecal drug concentrations. The suppressive effect was selective in that the anaerobic flora was left intact. A suppression of the aerobic intestinal flora could lead to an important reduction of recurrent infections of the urinary tract in these patients.
TI  - Pheromones among the procaryotes.
AB  - A pheromone is a chemical excreted by an organism into the environment that acts  to elicit a specific response from other organisms of the same species. The importance of pheromones in the life cycle of various species of mammals, insects, and fungi is well known. In the past decade, it has become apparent that pheromones influence the behavior and development of prokaryotes. Pheromones excreted by myxobacteria, actinomycetes, and cyanobacteria elicit specific developmental responses from these organisms. In addition, pheromones excreted by Streptococcus faecalis function in conjugation, and pheromones of luminescent bacteria regulate bioluminescence of these organisms.

TI  - Streptococcus faecalis: in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs, single and combined, with and without defibrinated human blood.
AB  - Ampicillin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, imipenem, mezlocillin, ofloxacin, penicillin G, piperacillin, and vancomycin were examined for inhibitory and bactericidal activity in various broth media against 7 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis. On a weight-for-weight basis, ampicillin, imipenem, mezlocillin, and ofloxacin proved to be more efficacious. All enterococcal isolates were resistant against gentamicin; fusidic acid and vancomycin lacked bactericidal activity. The combinations of either ampicillin, imipenem, mezlocillin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, or vancomycin with a subinhibitory concentration (4 micrograms/ml) of gentamicin, with or without added 65% (v/v) fresh defibrinated human blood, respectively, yielded additive effects against all enterococcal isolates. The addition of fresh human blood failed to enhance the antienterococcal activity of 4 micrograms/ml of gentamicin; in contrast, addition of 65% (v/v) fresh or heat-inactivated (56 degrees C, 30 min) normal rabbit, bovine, and human sera augmented the activity of gentamicin, an effect that was ablated through the addition of either 0.005 M DTT or 0.01 M MgCl2 + 0.01 M EGTA + 0.01 M CaCl2, supplements known to antagonize human serum beta-lysin, but not lysozyme activity.

TI  - Antibacterial properties of 2-acetylpyridine-1-oxide thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - We have investigated the in vitro antibacterial activity of 13 2-acetylpyridine-1-oxide thiosemicarbazones and 5 thiosemicarbazides against 80 clinically significant bacterial cultures, including 13 isolates with known antibiotic resistance. Of the thiosemicarbazones tested, 5 had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.25 microgram/ml for Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates; 1 of these had an MIC range of 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml for the Neisseria meningitidis cultures, and 2 had MICs of 2 and 2-4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis isolates, respectively. Two of the thiosemicarbazides had MICs of 0.25 microgram/ml for N. gonorrhoeae, whereas 2 others had MICs of 2-4 and 4-8 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and S. faecalis isolates, respectively. The test compounds were ineffective against the gram-negative enteric cultures and the Pseudomonas isolates.
TI  - In vitro studies of plasmid-mediated penicillinase from Streptococcus faecalis suggest a staphylococcal origin.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus faecalis with plasmid-mediated penicillinase production was studied further. Partially purified penicillinase from the S. faecalis strain hydrolyzed penicillin, ampicillin, and ureido-penicillins but not penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, or imipenem; hydrolysis was inhibited by clavulanic acid. Hydrolysis of a given antibiotic correlated with a marked increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of that drug when a high inoculum was used. As with most enterococci, the MICs of cephalosporins and penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins were too high for clinical usefulness, although these agents did not show an inoculum effect. Based upon hybridization under stringent conditions of plasmid DNA from the S. faecalis strain to cloned penicillinase genes from Staphylococcus aureus, it appears that these resistance determinants are highly homologous and suggests that this enzyme was introduced into streptococci from staphylococci.
TI  - (beta-Chloro-alpha-aminoethyl)phosphonic acids as inhibitors of alanine racemase  and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase.
AB  - The (beta-chloro-, (beta, beta-dichloro-, and (beta, beta, beta-trichloro-alpha-aminoethyl)phosphonic acids have been synthesized and their inhibitory properties on the alanine racemases [EC 5.1.1.1] and the D-Ala:D-Ala ligases [EC 6.3.2.4] from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis have been evaluated. The monochloro and the dichloro derivatives of Ala-P exhibit a strong inhibition on the racemases of the two species tested but do not behave as suicide substrates. Only the D-Ala:D-Ala ligase of S. faecalis is inhibited by these compounds. The poor antibacterial activity observed with beta-chloro- and beta, beta-dichloro-Ala-P might be enhanced by the peptide-transport strategy.
TI  - Induction of surface exclusion (entry exclusion) by Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromones: use of monoclonal antibodies to identify an inducible surface antigen involved in the exclusion process.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pCF-10 is representative of a class of plasmids that enables its host cells to respond to sex pheromones produced by other S. faecalis cells. The pheromone response has been previously shown to result in increased conjugal plasmid transfer, cell clumping, and multiple cell-surface antigenic changes. To test for other effects of pheromone induction, cells carrying pCF-10 were used as recipients in matings with an isogenic donor strain carrying a derivative of pCF-10, tagged with a transposon to provide an additional selective marker. Pheromone induction of the "male recipients" decreased their recipient ability by a factor of 10-300 in comparison to uninduced cells or plasmid-free recipients. These results indicate that an entry exclusion (surface exclusion) function, similar to that described in studies of plasmids in Gram-negative bacteria, is induced during the S. faecalis pheromone response process. The exclusion operates only against homologous plasmids. Immunological, biochemical, and genetic experiments using monoclonal antibodies reactive with C130, the predominant protein antigen associated with the pheromone response of cells carrying pCF-10, indicate that this antigen is involved in surface exclusion. The data also support the notion that synthesis of C130 involves a posttranslational modification of a precursor of C130 to a final product of higher molecular weight form.
TI  - Bacteriophage SPO2-mediated plasmid transduction in transpositional mutagenesis within the genus Bacillus.
AB  - A single copy of the Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917, located in the Bacillus subtilis chromosome, was able to transpose onto the SPO2 cos plasmid pPL1017, which codes for chloramphenicol resistance and contains the bacteriophage phi 105 immunity region. Selection for pPL1017::Tn917 chimeras was performed by SPO2-mediated plasmid transduction of transposon-borne resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics (MLSr). The transposition of Tn917 onto plasmid pPL1017 occurred with a frequency of 10(-5) and was dependent on the presence of a subinhibitory dose of erythromycin. Twelve chimeras were subjected to genetic and physical analyses. Two Cams transductants harbored plasmids whose chloramphenicol acetyltransferase genes had been insertionally inactivated by Tn917. Several transpositions in the vicinity of the phi 105 immunity region were detected. However, all of the 300 MLSr, Camr transductants screened were immune to phi 105 infectious activity. One pPL1017::Tn917 chimera, pLK200, was transferred by SPO2 plasmid transduction into the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens prototrophic strain DSM7. Plasmid pLK200 was effective in the mutagenesis of the DSM7 chromosome and yielded auxotrophs at a frequency of 0.5 to 5.3%. Generation of auxotrophs was also dependent on the presence of a subinhibitory dose of erythromycin. Forty-four auxotrophs representing at least nine amino acid requirements were recovered.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance from streptococci to  Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Three broad host-range MLS plasmids, pAM beta 1 (Em), pIP501 (Em, Cm) and pJH4 (Em, Sm, Km), were transferred by a conjugation-like process from Streptococcus faecalis to Clostridium acetobutylicum. The plasmids were stably maintained and antibiotic resistances were fully expressed in C. acetobutylicum, except for chloramphenicol resistance, which was poorly expressed, if at all. The C. acetobutylicum strains harbouring every plasmid could be used as donors in intraspecific matings with frequencies of approximately 1 X 10(-5) to 1 X 10(-6).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  - Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.
TI  - [Splenic abscess disclosing endocarditis].
AB  - A 54 year old man, hospitalised for thoraco-abdominal pain resulting from a septicemia which gives positive hemocultures for streptococcus D Bovis, is diagnosed to have a splenic abscess which will require splenectomy. At the same time, an endocarditis develops and gets worse, with auriculo-ventricular blockade and, especially, major aortic insufficiency, which is the cause of death by a brutal and massive pulmonary oedema. In the progression of an endocarditis, the occurrence of a splenic abscess, primary localisation of the initial septicemia or the secondary of an arterial septic embolism, is a rare contingency compared to the frequency of splenomegaly or splenic infarction: less than 2 percent of the cases in the literature. This very atypical and exceptional case serves as a reminder, on the one hand, of the diagnostic inadequacy of echocardiography which cannot visualise vegetation in the course of progressive endocarditis, and, on the other, of the prognostic importance of auriculoventricular blockade in septal and aortic endocardial lesions.
TI  - Further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence agents. The studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. Results are as follows. 1) Heparin inhibits the adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus fecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) Drugs which inhibit E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit E. coli adherence to the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect E. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) Extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent E. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) The ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. Similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. These studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistance  transposon Tn917 in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 was cloned in Escherichia coli on plasmid vector pBR325. The erythromycin resistance determinant of Tn917 was not expressed in the E. coli background. The nucleotide sequence of Tn917 was determined and found to be 5,257 base pairs in length. Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and designated 1 through 6 (5' to 3'); all were on the same DNA strand. A region exhibiting strong homology with known promoters was identified upstream from ORF1. ORFs 1 to 3 were virtually identical to the previously sequenced erythromycin resistance determinant on Streptococcus sanguis plasmid pAM77. At the 3' point, where the homology between Tn917 and pAM77 ends, was a 20-base-pair region about 80% homologous with a component of the res site of Tn3. The amino acid sequence of ORF4 showed homology with other site-specific recombination enzymes, including approximately 30% homology with the resolvase of Tn3. Contained within Tn917 was a directly oriented 73-base-pair duplication of the left terminus. The Tn917 sequence revealed that antibiotic-enhanced transposition might be due to extension of transcription from the resistance-related genes (in ORFs 1 to 3) into transposition genes (in ORFs 4 to 6). Transcription analyses resulted in data consistent with this interpretation.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1 contains a pAM alpha 1 delta 1-like replicon.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1 did not transform competent strains of Streptococcus sanguis. A hybrid plasmid, pDL310, consisting of virtually all of the S. faecalis hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid pJH2 and a segment of pJH1 DNA that included the tetracycline resistance determinant, yielded tetracycline-resistant transformants at a frequency of less than 10(-8) transformants per CFU, when it was added to a competent culture of S. sanguis Wicky. Four of the transformants contained a 4.7-kilobase plasmid (pDL316) that transformed strain Wicky at a frequency of 8.6 X 10(-8). Restriction endonuclease digests, agarose gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridizations indicated that pDL316 consisted entirely of pJH1-derived DNA. Additional restriction studies, Southern blot hybridizations, and heteroduplex analyses indicated that pDL316 was very closely related to 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid pAM alpha 1 delta 1, a derivative of 9.0-kilobase S. faecalis plasmid pAM alpha 1.
TI  - Comparative kinetic studies on the two interconvertible forms of Streptococcus faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase.
AB  - In this work the two interconvertible forms of inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) of Streptococcus faecalis were shown to differ in kinetics. The highly active form of the enzyme was more sensitive to the changes in the Mg2+ concentration, and thus also more sensitive to the inhibition caused by ATP, which competes with PPi for the chelation of Mg2+ ions. We have previously described a kinetic model for the less-active form of S. faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase [Lahti & Jokinen (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3526-3530]. The kinetic model of the highly active enzyme form is proposed to be a modification of the model of the less-active form in which enzyme activation by free Mg2+ is necessary for the reaction to occur. In this model the enzyme exists in two states, referred to as R- and T-states. In the absence of ligands the enzyme is in the T-state. R-state, i.e. the catalytically active state, exists only in the presence of free Mg2+. Mg1PPi2- is the primary substrate, and free pyrophosphate is a weak inhibitor that cannot serve as a substrate for the highly active form of S. faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase. This model closely resembles that previously presented for yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase.
TI  - [Typing of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains with bacteriophages].
AB  - With a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for Streptococcus faecalis and a set of  7 bacteriophages specific for Streptococcus faecium 441 strains of S. faecalis and 53 strains of S. faecium were typed. The species identification was done by means of the API 20 STREP system. For S. faecalis 22 and for S. faecium 12 lysotypes were found. Among S. faecalis strains lysotype V6b was most common (27%), followed by the lysotypes XV (9,5%), XIII1 (7%), II1 (5,7%), and I1 (4,3%). These 5 lysotypes comprised 54% of all 441 strains. 21% of the strains of S. faecalis and 6 from 53 strains of S. faecium were untypable. Strains of S. faecium were most frequently isolated from faeces and in rare cases from urine. To the contrary 50% of the S. faecalis strains were isolated from urine. There was no correlation between special lysotypes and age of the patients or the source of specimen. The results of phage typing of several strains from one patient, and especially of strains from mothers and their newborns suggest the usefulness of the typing system to clarify epidemiological questions.
TI  - Enzyme release of antigen from Streptococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes  cross-reactive with Lancefield group G typing reagents.
AB  - Enzyme extraction methods are commonly used to release antigen for Lancefield serogrouping of streptococci. Recently, up to 47% of enterococci have been found to possess antigens cross-reactive with both the group D and the group G grouping reagents. We investigated whether the organisms had recently emerged or whether changes in extraction methods (enzyme extraction) have resulted in our awareness of their existence. We found that approximately 20% of our enterococcal isolates released material cross-reactive with the group G reagents. These organisms have been present for at least 6 years, and probably for many more. In addition, we found that most strains of Listeria monocytogenes also released antigen cross-reactive with the group G reagent. The clinical significance of these findings is also discussed.
TI  - Transferable resistance and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterococci.
AB  - Ten isolates of Streptococcus faecalis and two isolates of S. faecium were studied together with an NCTC strain of each species. Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed different patterns of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. Three S. faecalis strains were highly resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. By means of a filter membrane technique, transfer of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was demonstrated from S. faecalis to S. faecalis, from S. faecium to S. faecalis and from S. faecalis to S. faecium, the last of which has not previously been described. Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were assayed with radiolabelled cofactors. High-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides could be attributed to the production of 2''-O-phosphotransferases, 3'-O-phosphotransferases, 6-O-adenylyltransferases and 6'-N-acetyltransferases. Other resistance mechanisms accounted for resistance in two strains of S. faecalis and one strain of S. faecium that were highly resistant only to streptomycin and one S. faecalis strain that was moderately resistant to all aminoglycosides. A low level of 6'-N-acetyltransferases was detected in the three strains of S. faecium but this did not confer high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and this trait could not be transferred.
TI  - Reversal of the in vitro susceptibility of enterococci to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole by folinic acid.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 21 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis to trimethoprim (TMP) in combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was evaluated in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) in the presence and absence of folinic acid as well as in urine. The mean MIC and MBC in MHB, expressed as the TMP concentration, was 0.13 and 0.32 micrograms of TMP-SMX per ml, respectively. In MHB supplemented with folinic acid, the mean MIC and MBC was 3.3 and 5.5 micrograms of TMP-SMX per ml, respectively. In urine the mean MIC of TMP-SMX for these isolates was 8.1 micrograms/ml (range, 1.6 to 50 micrograms/ml). All isolates were inhibited by less than 0.01 micrograms of TMP-SMX per ml when methotrexate was added to the urine.
TI  - Microbial preparation of L-[15N]tyrosine and [15N]tyramine and their gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses.
AB  - The preparation of L-[15N]tyrosine and [15N]tyramine by microbial synthesis is described. Immobilized Erwinia herbicola cells were added to a reaction mixture containing phenol, pyruvic acid, and 15NH4Cl. The reaction was driven by excess nonlabeled pyruvate and phenol. Under these denaturing concentrations of phenol, immobilized cells were more effective than free ones. Gram quantities of L-[15N]tyrosine were obtained without label dilution. The conversion of this L-[15N]tyrosine into [15N]tyramine by Streptococcus faecalis was performed at maximal efficiency. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric studies and 1H and 15N NMR analyses of the labeled compounds are reported.
TI  - Granulomatous enterocolitis induced in rats by purified bacterial cell wall fragments.
AB  - This study was designed to determine if poorly biodegradable bacterial cell wall  components can produce chronic intestinal inflammation. A sterile aqueous suspension of sonically disrupted group A or group D streptococcal cell wall fragments was injected intramurally into the small intestine and cecum of 100 rats. Gross findings in rats killed at intervals of 1 day to 6 mo included intestinal thickening, adhesions, and mesenteric contraction. Acute histologic inflammation subsided by 2 wk, but chronic granulomatous inflammation persisted for 6 mo in the rats injected with group A streptococcal cell wall fragments and 3 mo in the rats injected with group D streptococcal cell wall fragments. Ninety-six control rats identically injected with human serum albumin or phosphate-buffered saline demonstrated mild acute inflammation that resolved, with only 1 rat having chronic intestinal inflammation. Granulomas in the intestine, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes developed in 46% of the rats injected with group A fragments and 45% of the rats injected with group D streptococcal cell wall fragments, compared with 20% of the controls injected with albumin and 4% of the controls injected with phosphate-buffered saline. Group A streptococcal antigen was detected by immunofluorescence at the site of inflammation for 4 mo, and possible reactivation of acute inflammation was seen up to 6 mo after injection. We conclude that bacterial cell wall fragments are capable of producing chronic granulomatous inflammation in the intestinal wall if present in appropriate particle size and concentration. We speculate that cell walls from the enteric microflora may leak across a permeable mucosa in chronic inflammatory bowel disease to initiate and sustain local and systemic inflammation.
TI  - Streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  - Histidine-containing protein (HPr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (P-ser-HPr) in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (J. Deutscher and M. H. Saier, Jr., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:6790-6794, 1983). Here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of Streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr. The enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 X 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a Sephacryl S-200 column. On native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 X 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 X 10(4) and 7 X 10(4). Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the ATP-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of HPr, had no effect on the phosphatase activity. Other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. However, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the ATP-dependent HPr kinase, stimulated the P-ser-HPr phosphatase. EDTA at a concentration of 0.1 mM completely inhibited the phosphatase. Divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ overcame the inhibition by EDTA. Fe2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ had no effect, whereas Ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. ATP was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. Under conditions in which ATP severely inhibited the phosphatase, ADP was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. Besides P-ser-HPr of S. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr of Streptococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus casei. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the S. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold decreased in the presence of P-ser-HPr of S. aureus, as compared with HPr. However, when P-ser-HPr was first incubated with P-ser-HPr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as HPr. Besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. After the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- SD) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. At 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the Escherichia coli (1:256) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). In urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- SD. Bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. A post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. 1H NMR studies on chemically modified HPr proteins.
AB  - The low-pK tyrosyl residue present in the heat-stable proteins (HPr) of all Gram-positive bacteria studied until now has been labeled by tetranitromethane in the HPr of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis. The nitrotyrosyl derivatives obtained are fully active in the complementation assay. The labeled tyrosyl residues could be identified as Tyr-37 in both proteins. Reinvestigation of the low-pK tyrosyl residue in HPr of Staphylococcus aureus resulted in the same assignment. In all three proteins an interaction between nitrotyrosine-37 and the active center His-15 could be observed, leading to an increase in the pK of His-15 and a change of its chemical shift parameters. The 1H NMR lines of the complete aromatic spin system of HPr of B. subtilis could be assigned by the nitration studies. Labeling of Arg-17 in HPr of S. aureus and S. faecalis by 1,2-cyclohexanedione in the presence of borate ions causes an almost complete inhibition of its enzymatic activity. In the NMR spectrum the labeling of the arginyl residue influences the resonance lines of His-15: two new resonance lines for the C-2 protons of equal intensity are observed, a fact that could be explained by two different conformations in slow exchange. The pK value of His-15 was not changed by the labeling, excluding Arg-17 as responsible for the low pK of His-15.
TI  - Purification and properties of LIQ 4, an antibacterial substance produced by Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens K4.
AB  - An antibacterial substance (LIQ 4) produced by Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens K 4 was isolated in extracellular and cell associated form. It markedly inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, whereas only a few Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible. LIQ 4 was purified by hydrophobic chromatography (Servachrome XAD-2; octyl-Sepharose CL-4B; Sephadex LH 60) and Sephacryl S-200. TLC yielded a fluorescent spot as the active component and several inactive ninhydrin-positive substances. These contaminating peptides strongly adsorbed to LIQ 4 and could only be removed by repeated reversed phase HPLC. Furthermore, HPLC separated LIQ 4 into seven closely related substances. All showed strong fluorescence under UV light, stained yellow with ninhydrin, and contained aspartate and lysine after acid hydrolysis. The molecular weight was estimated by Amicon ultrafiltration to be less than 2000. LIQ 4 was stable at 80 degrees C (30 min) and pH 2, but considerably inactivated above pH 8. It was apparently affected by proteolytic enzymes, but the activity could be fully restored upon heating.
TI  - Evaluation of Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser for detecting significant bacteriuria.
AB  - In a pilot study a prototype Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser was used to study the growth of six commonly encountered urinary pathogens in a range of five different laboratory media. No single medium had been able to show acceptable conductance changes for all bacteria within five hours. Subsequently, the Malthus system, with fastidious anaerobe broth as the culture medium, was used to screen 500 consecutive clinical specimens of urine for significant bacteriuria. After two and a half hours the Malthus system detected 32 out of the 40 true positives and eight of the 44 contaminated urines. Increasing the detection time to five hours permitted the recognition of 39 true positives and 37 contaminated urines.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpirome (HR 810), teicoplanin and four other antimicrobials against enterococci.
AB  - In-vitro activities of cefpirome (HR 810), a fourth generation cephalosporin, and teicoplanin were compared with those of ampicillin, piperacillin, and vancomycin against 56 clinical isolates of enterococci. Cefpirome had good activity with the MIC90 and MBC90 being 4 and 16 mg/l. Ampicillin and piperacillin had MBC90 of 4 and 16 mg/l. Teicoplanin was extremely active with the MIC90 being 1.6 mg/l while vancomycin had poor cidal activity with the MBC90 being 16 mg/l. A decrease in activity of cefpirome was noted when the inoculum size was increased from 10(3) to 10(7) organisms per ml. Synergy was demonstrated against most Streptococcus faecium isolates with a combination of cefpirome and gentamicin or piperacillin. Against Str. faecalis, with a similar combination, synergy was seen in less than 50% isolates. No antagonism was noted with any of the antibiotic combinations.
TI  - Kinetic model for the action of the inorganic pyrophosphatase from Streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  - Kinetic studies of the less active form of Streptococcus faecalis inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1), together with computational analysis, indicated that cooperativity in ligand binding contributes in a significant way to the behavior of this enzyme. The simplest model applicable to our data was a Monod-Wyman-Changeux-type, allosteric model, in which the enzyme is proposed to exist in two states, referred to as R and T states, respectively. In the absence of ligands, 94% of the enzyme was in the T state. MgPPi2- was the only substrate for the enzyme in the R form. This substrate was bound equally well by both enzyme forms, but it was hydrolyzed 5 times more efficiently by the R form than it was by the T form. Mg2PPi was bound exclusively to the T state of the enzyme, and it was hydrolyzed 25% as rapidly as MgPPi2- by the T form. Mg2PPi inhibited the hydrolysis of the more efficient substrate, MgPPi2-, by competing with MgPPi2- for the enzyme in the T form and by shifting the R----T equilibrium in favor of the T form. Mg2+ stabilized the R state, thus activating the hydrolysis of MgPPi2- and inhibiting that of Mg2PPi.
TI  - False-resistance of Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas maltophilia to norfloxacin by disc diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  
TI  - Antagonistic effect of penicillin-amikacin combinations against enterococci.
AB  - Amikacin has been shown to antagonize the bactericidal effect of penicillin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis which produce aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase. The mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs was studied with an enzyme-producing strain (8436) and an enzyme-negative strain (8436c) derived by curing the former with novobiocin. Combinations of amikacin with beta-lactam antibiotics were antagonistic against strain 8436 but synergistic against strain 8436c. Against strain 8436 penicillin-amikacin combinations resulted in levels of killing comparable to those seen with high concentrations of penicillin (500 micrograms/ml), which were less bactericidal than lower concentrations of penicillin. No antagonism was observed between amikacin and non-beta-lactam cell wall-active drugs or between penicillin and kanamycin or neomycin, both of which are substrates for the enzyme. At concentrations near the MIC, amikacin was bactericidal against strain 8436c but bacteriostatic against strain 8436 (MIC, 250 micrograms/ml; MBC, 2,000 micrograms/ml). Neither penicillin nor phosphorylated amikacin affected the inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis by amikacin in a cell-free system. Although antagonism of killing by amikacin in enzyme-positive strains was specific for combinations which included beta-lactam antibiotics, amikacin did not influence the binding of [3H]penicillin to penicillin-binding proteins in isolated bacterial cell membranes or in intact cells and did not detectably affect the autolytic system of cells exposed to penicillin. Antagonism of beta-lactam activity by a bacteriostatic effect of amikacin against the enzyme-producing strain is the most likely explanation for this phenomenon.
TI  - Barotolerant variant of Streptococcus faecalis with reduced sensitivity to glucose catabolite repression.
AB  - Physiological characterization of the APR-11 variant of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 revealed that the variant has reduced sensitivity to glucose catabolite repression. This reduced sensitivity was indicated by the synthesis of enzymes for catabolism of lactose or arginine in cultures growing at 0.1, 40, or 70 MPa in media with levels of glucose highly repressive for the parent strain. Reduced catabolite repression appeared to be due to reduced activity of the glucose-specific, phosphotransferase system in APR-11 cells. Conversion of pyruvate to lactate or to acetate and ethanol did not appear to be altered in the variant. The APR-11 variant produced a greater final yield of biomass than the parent at all pressures tested, and its barotolerance was especially marked in media with low levels of glucose and high levels of lactose in which derepression of the lactose catabolic system was necessary for full growth. Overall, the greater barotolerance of the APR-11 strain appeared to be due to its enhanced capacity for catabolism related to its reduced sensitivity to catabolite repression by glucose.
TI  - Comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by Streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  - Recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). We tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains (two strains of Streptococcus faecalis, one of Streptococcus bovis, and three of viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses of amoxicillin alone. Successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. This protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. We concluded that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.
TI  - Treatment of streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  - Patients with infective endocarditis caused by penicillin-sensitive streptococci  (minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin of 0.1 microgram/ml or less) may be treated successfully with one of the following regimens: aqueous penicillin G administered intravenously for four weeks, intravenous aqueous penicillin G for four weeks combined with streptomycin for the first two weeks of therapy, or parenterally administered penicillin plus streptomycin for two weeks. A cure rate of at least 98 percent may be anticipated with each of these regimens. During a 12-year period among 142 patients treated for two weeks with penicillin and streptomycin, one (0.7 percent) had relapse and four (3 percent) had vestibular toxicity. The major advantage of the two-week regimen is that it is more cost-effective than the four-week regimens. The major disadvantage of the use of streptomycin is the relatively low risk of vestibular toxicity. Patients with enterococcal endocarditis were treated initially for four weeks with aqueous penicillin G together with either streptomycin (streptomycin-susceptible enterococci, 36 patients) or gentamicin (streptomycin-resistant enterococci, 20 patients). Compared with patients who had symptoms for less than three months, patients with symptoms for longer than three months had a higher relapse rate (0 percent versus 44 percent; p less than 0.001) and mortality (2.5 percent versus 25 percent; p less than 0.001). Patients with mitral valve endocarditis had a significantly higher relapse rate (25 percent) than patients with aortic valve infection (0 percent; p less than 0.01]. Gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity was more frequent (p less than 0.001) among patients treated with more than 3 mg/kg per day of gentamicin than among those treated with 3 mg/kg per day or less (100 percent versus 20 percent). Relapse and mortality rates did not differ significantly between patients treated with low-dose or high-dose gentamicin regimens. Patients who have had symptoms of enterococcal endocarditis for longer than three months or perhaps patients with mitral valve infection should receive at least six weeks of penicillin therapy together with an aminoglycoside; patients without either high-risk factor may be treated successfully for four weeks.
TI  - [Pefloxacin: clinical experience].
AB  - Pefloxacin was given as the single drug (except in one case) to twenty-seven patients with a variety of infections (bone and/or joint: 8; respiratory tract: 6; urinary tract: 5; bacteremia: 4; meninges: 3; other: 1). The following bacteria were isolated: P. aeruginosa: 11; Enterobacteriaceae: 10; Acinetobacter: 3; Staphylococci: 3 (including 2 methicillin-resistant strains), and Streptococcus faecalis: 2. Pefloxacin was given in a daily dosage of 800 mg in 20 patients and 1 200 to 1 600 mg in 7. All pathogens proved susceptible, in varying degrees. 21 patients recovered. Three incomplete results and three failures were observed. No significant side effects were recorded except for development of three mucosal candidiasis and two transient rashes. The authors put special emphasis on the value of pefloxacin in bone and meningeal infections.
TI  - [Computerized analysis of activity profiles of beta-lactams].
AB  - This study was designed to compare the in vitro activities of recent cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. One of our objectives was to determine whether the microbiologist could use a single cephalosporin for routine antibiotic sensitivity testing. All the strains studied were recovered from outpatients. Sensitivity and/or resistance were evaluated by MIC determination, according to a program developed in our laboratory, using a personal computer. Using special programs, patterns of activities of beta-lactams were determined quantitatively and graphically for each bacterial strain tested. For most strains ceftriaxone, and to a lesser extent moxalactam and cefoperazone, exhibited greater antibacterial activity than the other beta-lactams, except against group D streptococci. For Enterobacteriaceae, cefadroxil is satisfactory in screening for in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
TI  - [HR 810 (cefpirome). Experimental evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo antibiotic activity of a new amino-2-thiazole methoxy- imino cephalosporin].
AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new amino thiazole cephalosporin whose specific characteristic is a cyclopentenopyridinium group in position 3 of the cephem nucleus. This structure is responsible for a broad spectrum of activity, covering Enterobacteriaceae, including cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D Streptococci.
TI  - [Cefpirome (HR 810). A new broad spectrum cephalosporin].
AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new 2-amino-thiazol cephalosporin whose salient characteristic is a bicyclic nucleus, namely cyclopenteno-pyridinium, in position 3. This nucleus imparts a broad spectrum of activity that includes Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria, non-D Streptococcus and Haemophilus. Cefpirome is also active, although to a lesser extent, against Streptococcus faecalis and Acinetobacter.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in vitro and regression studies for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The antibacterial activity in vitro of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone was investigated against 575 recent clinical isolates. Both cephalosporins displayed excellent activity against most of the pathogens tested, in particular Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Apart from the Pseudomonas group, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejuni ceftriaxone was slightly to moderately more active than ceftazidime overall. Ceftriaxone was moderately active against Streptococcus faecalis. Regression lines for the two antibiotics were almost identical. Corresponding to differences in susceptibility, the zone sizes differed for the two drugs with respect to certain bacterial groups, e.g. Pseudomonas sp. and enterococci. Therefore, the two cephalosporins cannot substitute for each other in disc susceptibility testing. Breakpoints for disc tests around 8-16 micrograms/ml, as suggested in the literature, appear too high considering the beneficial pharmacokinetic properties of the two drugs.
TI  - Antistreptococcal activity of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was compared with that of penicillin and cefotaxime against clinical isolates of streptococci. Sch 34343 was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans streptococci, streptococci of groups A, B, C and G, and Str. bovis. Ninety per cent of these strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l of Sch 34343, penicillin and cefotaxime respectively. Activity of Sch 34343 against Str. faecalis was only moderate. Sch 34343 had very good bactericidal activity against group B streptococci, and showed high MBC/MIC ratios against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and Str. faecalis. Sch 34343, 20 mg/l, and gentamicin, 4 mg/l, were synergistic against both of the penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci, and one-third of the Str. faecalis strains.
TI  - In-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against nosocomial pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococci, gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied  in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. It was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), Clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and Bacteroides fragilis. On the basis of these promising results, Sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.
TI  - Neonatal septicaemia.
AB  - A total of 410 proved cases of neonatal septicaemia from seven Finnish hospitals  seen between 1976 and 1980 were reviewed. The annual incidence of neonatal septicaemia was 3 per 1000 births, and overall mortality was 23%. Onset was early in most patients. Symptoms of septicaemia occurred within the first 24 hours of life in 44% and within the first week of life in 90%. In the very early onset disease (within 24 hours) mortality was 30%, compared with 17% in all other cases. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause in very early onset disease (52%) but mortality from infection with this organism was similar to that in other very early onset cases. It is concluded that very early onset neonatal septicaemia, probably of intrauterine origin and caused by group B streptococcus in one half of the cases, constitutes the major form of neonatal septicaemia in Finland and should receive the highest priority in preventive measures.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of human lysozyme, muramidase-inactive lysozyme, and cationic polypeptides against Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus faecalis: inhibition by chitin oligosaccharides.
AB  - The basis of the bactericidal activity of human lysozyme against Streptococcus sanguis was studied. Experiments were designed to evaluate the role of lysozyme muramidase activity in its bactericidal potency. Inactivation of the muramidase activity of lysozyme was achieved by reduction of essential disulfides with dithiothreitol (DTT) or by incubation with the chitin oligosaccharides chitotriose and chitobiose. Muramidase-inactive lysozyme, prepared by reduction with DTT, was equal in bactericidal potency to native lysozyme. Solutions of native chicken egg white lysozyme and human lysozyme exhibited equal bactericidal potency yet differed ca. fourfold with respect to lytic (muramidase) activity. The above results suggested that the bactericidal activity of lysozyme is not dependent upon muramidase activity. Chitotriose and chitobiose were found to inhibit both lytic and bactericidal activities of lysozyme. The bactericidal activity of muramidase-inactive lysozyme (reduction with DTT) was also inhibited by chitotriose and chitobiose. Further investigations demonstrated that chitotriose and chitobiose were also potent inhibitors of the bactericidal activity of the cationic homopolypeptides poly-L-arginine and poly-D-lysine. These latter results suggested that the essential bactericidal property of lysozyme was its extreme cationic nature and that some bacterial endogenous activities, inhibitable by chitotriose and chitobiose, were essential for expression of the bactericidal activity of either native or muramidase-inactive lysozyme or of the cationic homopolypeptides. Experiments with Streptococcus faecalis whole cells, cell walls, and crude autolysin preparations implicated endogenous autolytic muramidases as the bacterial targets of chitotriose and chitobiose. The essentially identical responses of S. sanguis and S. faecalis to chitotriose in bactericidal assays with muramidase-inactive lysozyme and polylysine suggested that muramidase-like enzymes exist in S. sanguis and, furthermore, play an essential role in cationic protein-induced loss of viability of the oral microbe.
TI  - UV inactivation of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms.
AB  - Survival was measured as a function of the dose of germicidal UV light for the bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis spores, the enteric viruses poliovirus type 1 and simian rotavirus SA11, the cysts of the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii, as well as for total coliforms and standard plate count microorganisms from secondary effluent. The doses of UV light necessary for a 99.9% inactivation of the cultured vegetative bacteria, total coliforms, and standard plate count microorganisms were comparable. However, the viruses, the bacterial spores, and the amoebic cysts required about 3 to 4 times, 9 times, and 15 times, respectively, the dose required for E. coli. These ratios covered a narrower relative dose range than that previously reported for chlorine disinfection of E. coli, viruses, spores, and cysts.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cAM373) also produced by Staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (Tn918).
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis RC73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pAM373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cAM373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. The pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 Staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22 coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. Streptococcus sanguis Challis and G9B also produced the activity, but 10 other Streptococcus sanguis strains did not. The activity was also produced by Streptococcus faecium 9790. A tetracycline resistance (Tc) determinant present in S. faecalis RC73 was not associated with pAM373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pAM373 among other plasmids present in the strain. Analyses of the Tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to Tn916. Designated Tn918, the transposon could insert into pAM373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. Whereas pAM373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of Streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus sanguis. However, a derivative of pAM373 carrying Tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.
TI  - [Sensitivity to cefotiam of 494 hospital bacterial strains. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration and comparison with other beta-lactams].
AB  - Susceptibility to cefotiam of 494 bacterial strains was studied by MIC determination using an agar dilution assay. Activity of cefotiam was also compared with that of six other beta-lactams (ampicillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, cefalotin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam) using an agar diffusion method. Cefotiam showed a wide antibacterial spectrum including more than 70% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Serratia), beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, non-enterococcus streptococci, and penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin. Conversely, cefotiam was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratum, Streptococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Comparative antibacterial activity of piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis in cultures and human serum].
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin at 1/4, 1 and 4 X MHK against 5 strains each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis was compared in Mueller-Hinton-bouillon and human serum. Serum without piperacillin was bacteriostatic against P. aeruginosa for 8 hrs., against E. coli for 24 hrs. Subinhibitory piperacillin concentrations were bacteriostatic against E. coli, but had no effect against P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis. Bactericidal activity against E. coli was achieved at 1 X MHK against P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis at 4 X MHK. Except for P. aeruginosa in concentrations of 1/4 and 1 X MHK the piperacillin activity in bouillon and serum was almost identical.

TI  - Transformation and fusion of Streptococcus faecalis protoplasts.
AB  - Nonconjugative plasmids were transferred by protoplast fusion among Streptococcus faecalis strains and from Streptococcus sanguis to S. faecalis. S. faecalis protoplasts were also transformed with several different plasmids, including the Tn917 delivery vehicle pTV1. Transformation was reproducible, but low in frequency (10(-6) transformants per viable protoplast). A new shuttle vector (pAM610), able to replicate in Escherichia coli and S. faecalis, was constructed and transformed into S. faecalis protoplasts. pAM610 was mobilized by the conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1 in matings among S. faecalis strains and from S. sanguis to S. faecalis. Chimeric derivatives of pAM610 were also transformed into S. faecalis.
TI  - Identification of multiple cell surface antigens associated with the sex pheromone response of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - High-molecular-weight surface antigens, obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation of culture supernatants and identified in Western blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, have been correlated with the sex pheromone response of Streptococcus faecalis donor cells. Pheromone-induced cells carrying the conjugative plasmid pCF10 produced both an antigenic component (C130) composed of at least four bands in the range of 130 kilodaltons and a 73-kilodalton antigen (SA 73). The concentration of the C130 antigen in culture supernatants increased with time after exposure of donor cells to pheromone preparations. Gel filtration studies indicated that this antigen exists in the native state as a very large complex that is more than 180,000 daltons in size. The C130 antigen was susceptible to digestion by proteinase K and was not reactive with either concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin. The antigenicity of C130 was not destroyed by treatment of blots with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or papain before development with antibody, whereas the antigenicity of SA73 was susceptible to these treatments.
TI  - Purification of an alanine racemase from Streptococcus faecalis and analysis of its inactivation by (1-aminoethyl)phosphonic acid enantiomers.
AB  - An alanine racemase has been purified some 30 000-fold almost to homogeneity from Gram-positive Streptococcus faecalis NCIB 6459; the enzyme has been purified to the same extent (4000-fold) from an O-carbamyl-D-serine-resistant mutant with a 7-fold higher enzyme level in crude extract. The racemase has one pyridoxal phosphate molecule per 42-kDa subunit, has a Vmax of 3570 units/mg and a Km of 7.8 mM in the L to D direction, and has a Vmax of 1210 units/mg and a Km of 2.2 mM in the D to L direction. The Keq is 0.8 and kcat/Km values are ca. 3 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. The purified enzyme is inhibited in a time-dependent manner by both L- and D-(l-aminoethyl)phosphonates (Ala-P), confirming observations of Atherton et al. in crude extracts of this organism [Atherton, F. R., Hall, M. J., Hassal, C. H., Holmes, S. W., Lambert, R. W., Lloyd, W. J., & Ringrose, P. S. (1980) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 18, 897]. Studies with [1-2H]-, [1-3H]-, and [1,2-14C]Ala-P rule out enzymic activation and processing as the basis for irreversible inhibition. Thus, enzyme after exposure to [14C]Ala-P or [alpha-3H]Ala-P and gel filtration contains stoichiometric amounts of radioactive label, but denaturation quantitatively releases intact Ala-P into solution as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography and cocrystallization with authentic material. The Ala-P isomers are slow binding inhibitors of this racemase as is the alpha,alpha'-dimethyl analogue but not the D or L isomers of the corresponding phosphinate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Influence of the developmental state of valvular lesions on the antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime in experimental enterococcal infections.
AB  - Cefotaxime has little antimicrobial activity in vitro against most strains of enterococci, as measured by conventional MICs and MBCs. However, the MICs of cefotaxime against many enterococci are markedly reduced by the addition of serum to the test medium. To assess the relevance of this observation in vivo, we examined the efficacy of cefotaxime in experimental Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis. Since response to antimicrobial agents may vary with the degree of vegetation development, therapeutic efficacy was assessed both in rabbits with newly formed vegetations and in rabbits with well-developed endocardial lesions. Peak serum levels of cefotaxime (50.1 +/- 20.0 micrograms/ml) exceeded the MIC in medium supplemented with serum (4 micrograms/ml), but not in Mueller-Hinton broth alone (greater than 64 micrograms/ml). After 4 days of therapy, animals with newly formed lesions (therapy initiated 1 h after infection, transvalvular catheters removed) had lower mean vegetation bacterial titers than did untreated controls. Among animals with mature vegetations (therapy initiated 12 h after infection, catheters indwelling), the rate of mortality was significantly reduced by cefotaxime therapy. However, no difference in vegetation titers was observed. Thus, cefotaxime demonstrated antienterococcal activity within newly formed vegetations, but did not inhibit bacterial proliferation within well-established vegetations.
TI  - [Development and experimental study of a dried nutrient medium for the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections].
AB  - The comparative study of different protein bases has shown that the combined base containing animal blood hydrolysate (amino peptide) and acidic casein hydrolysate, moderately cleaved, in the proportion 1:1 is a good source of nitrogen and ensures the intensive growth of streptococci. As determined by the study of the physiological parameters and growth of streptococci, the presence of fodder yeast extract, glutamine, glucose and phosphates in media containing blood hydrolysate and casein hydrolysate has been found to render a stimulating effect on the growth and multiplication of these organisms. The data thus obtained have been used as the basis for developing the formula of a dried culture medium, capable of ensuring the growth of streptococci without blood or serum added and not inferior in its quality to Todd-Hewitt Broth manufactured by Oxoid Ltd. (Great Britain) and Difco Laboratories (USA). The physico-chemical and physiological characteristics of the proposed medium have been determined. The use of the new dried culture medium in medical practice will make it possible to improve the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections.
TI  - Mucin degradation in human colon ecosystems. Isolation and properties of fecal strains that degrade ABH blood group antigens and oligosaccharides from mucin glycoproteins.
AB  - We previously reported that the oligosaccharide chains of hog gastric mucin were  degraded by unidentified subpopulations numbering approximately 1% of normal human fecal bacteria. Here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of four healthy subjects. Four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. Three were Ruminococcus strains and two were Bifidobacterium strains. Two Ruminococcus torques strains, IX-70 and VIII-239, produced blood group A- and H-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. The Bifidobacterium strains lacked A-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the A antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. Only Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268 produced blood group B-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of B antigenic chains. When this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group B salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. The glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. In contrast, none of 16 other fecal Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bifidobacterium strains produced ABH blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five S. faecalis strains. We conclude that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. These properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group H antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group A- or B-degrading glycosidases.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - ATP-driven exchange of Na+ and K+ ions by Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We describe the characterization of KtrII, a novel potassium transport system of  Streptococcus faecalis, first discovered by H. Kobayashi [1982) J. Bacteriol. 150, 506-511). KtrII requires sodium ions and mediates the stoichiometric exchange of internal Na+ for external K+. Potassium accumulation is not energized by the electrochemical potentials of either H+ or Na+; the energy source is probably ATP. Two lines of evidence indicate that KtrII is a manifestation of the sodium-stimulated ATPase reported earlier (Heefner, D. L., and Harold, F. M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2798-2802). (i) Mutants that lack the ATPase also lack KtrII, and revertants recover both in parallel. (ii) KtrII and the Na+-ATPase are induced in parallel when cells are grown on media rich in sodium, particularly under conditions that limit the generation of a proton potential. KtrII is not induced in response to K+ deprivation. We propose that the Na+-ATPase exchanges Na+ for K+ ions.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent protein kinase enzyme I of Streptococcus faecalis:  purification and properties of the enzyme and characterization of its active center.
AB  - Enzyme I, the phosphoenolpyruvate:protein phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.3.9), which  is part of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate- (PEP) dependent phosphotransferase system, has been purified from Streptococcus faecalis by using a large-scale preparation. Size exclusion chromatography revealed a molecular weight of 140 000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, enzyme I gave one band with a molecular weight of 70 000, indicating that enzyme I consists of two identical subunits. The first 59 amino acids of the amino-terminal part of the protein have been sequenced. It showed some similarities with enzyme I of Salmonella typhimurium. The active center of enzyme I has also been determined. After phosphorylation with [32P]PEP, the enzyme was cleaved by using different proteases. Labeled peptides were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column. The amino acid composition or amino acid sequence of the peptides has been determined. The largest labeled peptide was obtained with Lys-C protease and had the following sequence: -Ala-Phe-Val-Thr-Asp-Ile-Gly- Gly-Arg-Thr-Ser-His*-Ser-Ala-Ile-Met-Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Ala- Ile-Val-Gly-Thr-Lys-. It has previously been shown that the phosphoryl group is bound to the N-3 position of a histidyl residue in phosphorylated enzyme I. The single His in position 12 of the above peptide must therefore carry the phosphoryl group.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of gentamicin in experimental enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gentamicin was compared with its therapeutic efficacy in rabbits with Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis. The test strain was resistant to gentamicin as measured by MICs and MBCs determined in Mueller-Hinton broth alone or in broth supplemented with 50% rabbit serum. Gentamicin also failed to manifest anti-enterococcal activity when evaluated by time-kill studies in broth. However, the addition of serum to the medium did enhance the activity of gentamicin. In the therapy of experimental endocarditis, gentamicin used alone demonstrated anti-enterococcal activity equivalent to that of ampicillin used alone. Vegetation titers in animals treated with gentamicin alone were lower than those of untreated controls (P less than 0.01) and comparable to those in animals treated with ampicillin alone. Thus, gentamicin demonstrated anti-enterococcal activity in vivo despite the resistance observed in vitro, as measured by conventional assays to determine MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in B27-associated arthropathies.
AB  - Lymphocyte transformation tests to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease and controls. Ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/Reiter's to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to S. faecalis (p = 0.008). It appears, therefore, that within the B27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease.
TI  - In vitro activity of six antibiotics against multiresistant staphylococci and other gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Sixty-two strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci,  21 Streptococcus faecalis and 17 other strains of streptococci isolated from cases of endocarditis were tested for sensitivity against rifampicin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, erythromycin and novobiocin. Only rifampicin, novobiocin and teicoplanin were found to be active against the great majority of these strains. The microbial properties of these antibiotics suggest the necessity of combinations for effective therapy. The combinations rifampicin + novobiocin and rifampicin + teicoplanin were additive and suppressed the emergence of resistant mutants. Thus according to in vitro tests, either of these two combinations would be suitable for prophylactic use in high-risk patients, especially those scheduled to receive prosthetic implants.

TI  - Formation of a beta-aspartyl phosphate intermediate by the vanadate-sensitive ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The vanadate-sensitive membrane ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis forms, as part of the reaction cycle, an acylphosphate intermediate. The phosphorylated amino acid residue was identified by reducing the purified reconstituted phosphoenzyme with [3H]borohydride, followed by acid hydrolysis of the protein and quantitative amino acid analysis. Tritiated homoserine was found to be the resulting reaction product, generated through the reduction of a beta-aspartyl phosphate residue. The S. faecalis ATPase thus forms the same phosphorylated intermediate as a number of eukaryotic transport ATPases and appears to be related to these enzymes.
TI  - A proton-translocating ATPase regulates pH of the bacterial cytoplasm.
AB  - Regulatory mechanisms of cytoplasmic pH in Streptococcus faecalis with no respiratory chain were investigated. In a mutant defective in cytoplasmic alkalization conducted by a proton-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase), the cytoplasmic pH is approximately 0.4 to 0.5 pH units lower than the medium pH, at pH 5.5 to 9.0. The cytoplasmic pH of the wild-type strain was always higher than that of the mutant at a pH below 8 and was the same as that of the mutant at an alkaline pH over 8. Thus, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated only by the cytoplasmic alkalization, and there is no regulation at alkaline pH in S. faecalis. A generation of the protonmotive force conducted by the H+-ATPase depended on the cytoplasmic pH rather than the medium pH, and the generation decreased rapidly when the cytoplasmic pH was increased over 7.7. The decrease at alkaline pH was not caused by increases in the rate of proton influx. These results suggest that cytoplasmic alkalization is diminished when alkaline pH of the cytoplasm is over 7.7, because of a low activity of proton extrusion by the H+-ATPase, and consequently, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated at about 7.7. The cytoplasmic pH was regulated at a high level in cells that had a high level of H+-ATPase. I conclude that in S. faecalis, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated by H+-ATPase.
TI  - Clinical experience of cefotaxime in infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - We studied the activity of cefotaxime both microbiologically and clinically. 138  blood cultures positive for gram-positive cocci were evaluated (90 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 25 of Streptococcus faecalis, 13 of Streptococcus alpha and ten of Streptococcus mutans). Cefotaxime showed good activity against all strains with the exception of S. mutans, of which only 30% were sensitive. Ten cases of gram-positive infections were studied clinically: six sepsis cases and one endocarditis case due to S. aureus, two sepsis cases caused by Streptococcus alpha and one Enterococcus endocarditis case. Therapy was successful in nine; the S. aureus endocarditis failed. The local and general tolerance of cefotaxime was good.
TI  - [Current aspects of infectious endocarditis. Review of 101 cases].
AB  - One hundred and one cases of infectious endocarditis were reviewed, from 1966 to  1982. The mean age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 15 years. There was a marked predominance of men (70.2 p. 100); the commonest portal of entry was dental (45.9 p. 100); the number of iatrogenic portals of entry and cases of endocarditis on prosthetic valves has been increasing in recent years. Blood cultures were positive in 83 p. 100 of cases; the commonest responsible organism was the non-D streptococcus (31 p. 100 of cases) followed by the D streptococcus (18.8 p. 100), the staphylococcus aureus (17.8 p. 100), and the staphylococcus epidermidis (2.9 p. 100). Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in 9.9 p. 100 of cases. Rare and slow growing organisms have been isolated since 1977. Echocardiography was then introduced and helped the diagnostic in 70 p. 100 of cases. Circulating immune complexes were measured in 25 patients and were found to be raised in 14 cases (56 p. 100). The commonest complication was cardiac failure (43 p. 100) which led to valve replacement in the acute phase in 14 p. 100 of cases. The occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias was a poor prognostic factor. The other complications were neurological (15 p. 100), renal (10 p. 100), embolic (19 p. 100), and pulmonary (9 p. 100). The mortality rate in the acute phase was 30 p. 100 and the probability of a five year survival was 54 p. 100.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone in comparison with nine other  antibiotics.
AB  - The results of a large three centre co-ordinated study into the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial clinical pathogens showed no significant evidence of regional variation within the U.K. towards the 10 antibiotics examined. The newer cephalosporins were highly potent and superior to other antibiotics against the Enterobacteriaceae, with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime the most potent. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin was the most active, followed by ceftazidime, piperacillin and ceftriaxone; cefotetan was the least active. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus were most susceptible to cefuroxime and gentamicin, though most were also susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. Streptococcus (Groups A and B), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were susceptible to most agents other than gentamicin, but ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were overall the most potent. Ceftriaxone was the most active agent against Haemophilus influenzae. The newer agents were variable and relatively poor against anaerobes and only amoxycillin and piperacillin were significantly active against Streptococcus faecalis. The overall resistance level to the third generation cephalosporins was low.
TI  - Effects of monoassociation with cariogenic streptococci on lymphoid tissue in the intestine and spleen of Harvard rats.
AB  
TI  - Protective activity of Streptococcus faecalis against pathogenic action of Escherichia coli O55 in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Peroral administration of Streptococcus faecalis suppresses the lethal effect of  simultaneous or subsequent infection with pathogenic Escherichia coli O55 in gnotobiotic colostrum-free piglets. The presence of S. faecalis in the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes in artificially diassociated colostrum-free piglets influences neither multiplication of E. coli in the intestine nor its penetration into the organism.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by a urogenital strain of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus faecalis isolated from the urogenital flora was selected for its ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Initially, the inhibitory activity was demonstrated on solid medium only when the inhibitor and the target strains were growing simultaneously, such as in the spot-lawn and flip-flop agar overlay methods. The antigonococcal effect was not due to a shift in the pH or depletion of nutrient in the medium. This activity was not produced in liquid medium nor could it be extracted in a soluble form from either the solid medium or the streptococcal cells. The production of the inhibitory activity could not be enhanced by ultraviolet irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C. The composition of the medium was found to affect the size of the inhibitory zone produced. The inhibitory activity showed a wide antigonococcal spectrum and was susceptible to trypsin and pronase but resistant to alpha- and beta-amylases and catalase. This activity passed through a filtering membrane and was also dialyzable and had an apparent molecular weight of less than 1,000. The addition of bovine serum albumin to solid medium enabled us to show an inhibition even when the producer and the target strains were grown sequentially, thus suggesting that part of the difficulty of studying such inhibitory activity could be due to its instability.
TI  - Characterization and mode of action of a purified bacteriocin from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans RM-10.
AB  - The purified bacteriocin was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase, but resistant to papain and pepsin. Lowering the pH of the bacteriocin caused precipitation, and the Abs280 of the supernatant reached a minimum at pH 3.6, suggesting that this is the isoelectric point. Such a pH value coincides with minimum bacteriocin activity. The effect of the bacteriocin was bactericidal rather than bacteriolytic and concentration dependent. Treatment of Streptococcus faecalis ODU with Rm-10 bacteriocin led rapidly to the cessation of biosynthesis of macromolecules, DNA, RNA and protein. Electron microscopy showed bacteriocin fibres attached in aggregated bundles to target cells; after ultra-sonication or detergent treatment they were individually attached to the cell surface and, at the same time, the apparent bacteriocin activity had doubled. Bacteriocin activity was not altered by filter-sterilized saliva components. Oral rinsing with Rm-10 bacteriocin reduced the number of viable salivary bacteria after 20 min, suggesting a possible therapeutic use for Rm-10 bacteriocin.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Deficiency of neutrophil bactericidal activity in term and preterm infants. A longitudinal study.
AB  - The present longitudinal study of 40 healthy term infants and 20 preterm infants  shows that neutrophil bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis is transiently but significantly impaired in term infants during the 1st week of life. The deficiency is more severe and prolonged in preterm infants, and may contribute to the neonate's increased susceptibility to infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci to trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
AB  - The in vitro activities of trimethoprim (TMP), alone and in combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMX), against 131 clinical isolates of enterococci, 126 Streptococcus faecalis isolates, and 5 Streptococcus faecium isolates were determined by a broth microdilution method with Mueller-Hinton broth that was substantially free of inhibitory substances. The geometric mean MIC of TMP for strains of S. faecalis was 0.164 micrograms/ml (range, 0.03 to 8 micrograms/ml), with a geometric mean MBC of 0.298 micrograms/ml (range, 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml). Although all strains were resistant to the sulfonamide alone, the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of TMP against strains of S. faecalis were markedly potentiated when TMP was combined in a fixed ratio of 1:19 with SMX; the geometric mean MIC of TMP was reduced to 0.016 micrograms/ml (range, 0.002 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), with a geometric mean MBC of 0.031 micrograms/ml (range, 0.004 to 0.25 micrograms/ml). The combination had no synergistic effect against strains of S. faecium; the geometric mean MICs and MBCs of both agents were ca. 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MBC/MIC ratios for TMP and TMP-SMX were less than or equal to 16 for all 131 strains. MICs and MBCs for TMP-SMX were unchanged, and for TMP they decreased when performed in broth supplemented with 50% heat-inactivated pooled human serum. For TMP and TMP-SMX, the susceptibilities of isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin were the same as those of isolates susceptible to less than or equal to 2,000 micrograms of aminoglycoside per ml. These results suggest that TMP-SMX and TMP alone could prove useful in the treatment of serious enterococcal infections, including infections by strains with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Survival and detection of Bacteroides spp., prospective indicator bacteria.
AB  - Preliminary experiments were performed to assess the use of intestinal Bacteroides spp. as indicators of fecal contamination of water. Viable counts of Bacteroides fragilis, an anaerobic bacterium, declined more rapidly than those of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. However, a fluorescent antiserum prepared against B. fragilis successfully detected high proportions (18 to greater than 50%) of B. fragilis cells suspended for 8 days in aerobic water in dialysis bags at the ambient temperature. These percentages were higher than the percent viable recoveries of the two indicator bacteria used for comparison. Thus, the fluorescent antiserum test for B. fragilis might serve as a useful indicator of fecal contamination of water. An advantage of this approach over coliform analysis is the rapidity at which the test can be performed.
TI  - The effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function in vitro.
AB  - Hypothermia may be associated with compromised host defenses and serious bacterial infections in man. We have examined the effects of moderate hypothermia (29 degrees C) on neutrophil function in vitro. At 29 degrees C, neutrophil phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus was impaired. In contrast, neutrophil killing of Streptococcus faecalis was most affected by hypothermia. Phagocytosis, as measured by neutrophil ingestion of opsonized oil-red-O-particles, was reduced at 29 degrees C over the 15 min of observation. Neutrophil metabolism linked to bactericidal pathways dependent on oxidative metabolism was reduced at 29 degrees C. Hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP) activity in neutrophils early after stimulation with latex particles was reduced. After 2 hr HMP activity was similar at 29 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Neotetrazolium dye reduction was reduced early after latex stimulation of neutrophils and after 30 min it was similar to cells at 37 degrees C. Leukocyte migration under agarose to bacterial-derived and formyl-methionyl-phenylalanine chemotactic factors was reduced by 50% and 70%, respectively. Migration to serum-derived chemotactic factor was reduced by only 20%. When cells were cooled to 29 degrees C for 30 to 90 min and rewarmed, neutrophil function was normal. These effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function may explain, in part, the increased incidence of serious and frequently fatal bacterial infections in man.
TI  - Gram-positive superinfections following beta-lactam chemotherapy: the significance of the enterococcus.
AB  - The recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. The summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. Moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. Ceftazidime or moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by Clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. Comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. The most common pathogens for the above drugs were the fungi (Candida spp.), Pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcal, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. Cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. The reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. The most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and fungi. Cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric Streptococcus spp. (Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium).
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of teicoplanin in experimental enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of teicoplanin and ampicillin, alone and in combination with gentamicin, were compared in experimental Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis. Bacterial titers in vegetations of rabbits treated with teicoplanin were significantly lower than those of untreated controls (P less than 0.01) and were equivalent to titers in ampicillin-treated animals. Gentamicin increased the activities of both drugs to a comparable degree.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of recently developed quinolone compounds--with a note on  the frequency of resistant mutants.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the new quinolone compounds enoxacin, norfloxacin,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was evaluated in 300 Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 30 Acinetobacter spp., 15 Haemophilus influenzae, 50 Streptococcus faecalis, and 70 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and compared to that of nalidixic acid, gentamicin and various beta-lactam compounds. Moreover, the rate of spontaneous mutants resistant to quinolone compounds was evaluated. In concentrations only insignificantly exceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), mutants could be isolated rather frequently (approx. 10(-6) fold); in concentrations of at least 10 times the MIC resistant mutants were barely detectable. In general, the mutants exhibited a 4- to 8-fold increase of the MIC as compared to the wild strain. In S. faecalis mutants were not detectable, whereas they occurred in low frequency (less than 10(-8) fold) in S. aureus strains. In all mutants there was almost, but not entirely, complete cross-resistance between the quinolone derivatives.
TI  - Sex pheromones and plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis: a pheromone, cAM373, which is also excreted by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Recent aspects of genetic manipulation in Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to several strains of Bacillus thuringiensis by a filter-mating process. From a transconjugant clone of B. thuringiensis a hybrid plasmid resulting from an in vivo insertion into pAM beta 1 of a 3 Md DNA sequence was isolated. This 3 Md DNA molecule (Th sequence) is related to several host plasmids found in different serotypes of B. thuringiensis. A reciprocal conjugation-like process involving the transfer of pAM beta 1 from B. thuringiensis to S. faecalis was also demonstrated. The comparison of the restriction maps of the crystal genes from plasmid and chromosomal origins of different serotypes, six of which having been cloned in E. coli, revealed the existence of two classes of genes which are very similar in the map corresponding to the N-terminal part of the protein, and which differ essentially in the 3' region. The presence of the transposon-like Th sequence was found in several cases associated with the crystal gene in the same host plasmid, and a model for their structural organization is proposed.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a pIP501 derivative yields a model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation.
AB  - We have previously constructed a derivative of the broad host range streptococcal plasmid pIP501, a conjugative plasmid designated pVA797, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and contains a unique EcoRI site in a non-essential region of the plasmid molecule. pVA797 (30.7 kb) when cloned in toto as an EcoRI fragment into the positive selection vector pOP203(A2+) gave a recombinant, pVA904 (37.7 kb), which was able to replicate in Escherichia coli and in streptococcal species. It can be phenotypically monitored in either genus by specific drug resistance markers (chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci, tetracycline resistance in E. coli). pVA904 segregates into E. coli minicells where it specifies the production of at least 13 polypeptides. Many of the polypeptides are missing in minicells containing a transfer-defective, deletion derivative of pVA904. pVA904 is an ideal model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation because it is a shuttle plasmid thus enabling manipulation using procedures established for E. coli. Specifically, it should be possible to define the genetic basis of streptococcal conjugation by coupling mutagenesis protocols and minicell protein analyses in E. coli with evaluation of transfer function in streptococci.

TI  - Isolation and structure of the bacterial sex pheromone, cAD1, that induces plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone cAD1, which is involved in the conjugative transfer of the hemolysin plasmid pAD1, has been isolated and its structure determined. Its Mr is 818 and its amino acid sequence is H-Leu-Phe-Ser-Leu-Val-Leu-Ala-Gly-OH. A replicate of the pheromone synthesized by the liquid-phase method showed the same biological activity and chromatographic behavior as the isolated cAD1. Pheromone activity was detectable at a concentration of approximately 5 X 10(-11) M.
TI  - Intraprostatic concentration of ciprofloxacin and its activity against urinary pathogens.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against 376 urinary pathogens was determined. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were 0.03-0.23 mg/l, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.37 mg/l, for Streptococcus faecalis 0.75 mg/l and for Staphylococcus aureus 0.92 mg/l. A 100 mg dose of ciprofloxacin was administered intravenously to 25 patients undergoing prostatectomy. The concentrations in prostate and serum were measured at different intervals. Peak levels in prostate were 3.0 micrograms/g attained 20 min after administration. Peak serum levels were 1.2 mg/l attained 20 min after administration. Serum and prostate elimination was slowly. The overall serum: prostate ratio 1:2.1.
TI  - Empyema and splenic abscess in infective endocarditis.
AB  - We report a case of empyema secondary to splenic abscess, cured by splenectomy, in the course of an infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Hydrolysis of linamarin by intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Linamarin, a cyanogenic glucoside, was hydrolyzed by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis but not by Clostridium perfringens when these organisms were grown on a glucose or lactose medium.
TI  - Return of Streptococcus faecalis DNA cloned in Escherichia coli to its original host via transformation of Streptococcus sanguis followed by conjugative mobilization.
AB  - Cloning vectors were introduced into Streptococcus faecalis by conjugation. A conjugative plasmid (pVA797) and cloning vector pVA838 recombined in Streptococcus sanguis at homologous sequences, forming a cointegrate. The pVA797::pVA838 cointegrate transferred to S. faecalis by conjugation. Recombination between homologous sequences resolved the cointegrate in the S. faecalis transconjugants, and pVA797 and pVA838 segregated because of incompatibility. S. faecalis strains that received pVA838 by this mechanism contained plasmids indistinguishable from authentic pVA838 from Escherichia coli. Other plasmids, including pVA736, were introduced into S. faecalis by this method. This approach should facilitate the introduction of cloned DNA into S. faecalis.
TI  - Streptococci with dual antigen specificity for Lancefield groups D and G.
AB  - Streptococci have been isolated which may be identified in serological tests as belonging to Lancefield group G, but in fact belong to group D. Twenty-two cultures with this property were obtained from four countries; they included Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus durans as well as Streptococcus faecalis. Selected strains were studied in serological tests and cross-absorption procedures, in which it was found that the group G reaction given by these isolates is due to an epitope with at least partial identity with reference group G antigen. Identification of an enterococcus as a group G streptococcus could lead to erroneous and ineffective chemotherapy. Antibiotic sensitivity testing of streptococcus group G isolates should be a routine procedure, and bile-aesculin and salt-tolerance testing of these isolates would be a wise precaution.
TI  - Isolation and structure of bacterial sex pheromone, cPD1.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone cPD1, which induces a mating response in cells harboring the conjugative plasmid pPD1, has been isolated and its structure determined. It was found to have a molecular weight of 912, and its amino acid sequence was H-Phe-Leu-Val-Met-Phe-Leu-Ser-Gly-OH. A synthetic octapeptide showed the same biological activity and chromatographic behavior as the isolated cPD1. Pheromone activity was detectable at a concentration of approximately 4 X 10(-11)M.
TI  - Cross-reactions of polysaccharides of staphylococci and streptococci in antipneumococcal and other antisera.
AB  - Relationships between chemical structure and immunological specificity, deduced from cross-precipitation with antibodies to polysaccharides of known structure, are drawn for polysaccharides of strains of staphylococci and of groups D and H streptococci.
TI  - A functional treatment method for interphalangeal pyogenic arthritis.
AB  - A treatment plan for pyogenic arthritis has been devised in which the accessory collateral ligaments are resected through radial and ulnar midaxial incisions. The surgical wound is debrided and copiously irrigated with an antibiotic solution, and intravenous antibiotics are instituted before operation and continued after operation. Physical therapy is begun within 24 hours of surgery and includes active range of motion (ROM) of all joints, dynamic splinting, and hand therapy to ensure both full flexion and extension. Forty patients were treated with this method within a 6-year period. Of five interphalangeal (IP) joints of the thumb, four regained 0 degree to 60 degrees full ROM and one gained 15 degrees to 65 degrees limited ROM. Of the two distal IP joints, one regained full ROM and the other became fused. Among the 33 proximal IP joints, 13 regained full ROM of 110 degrees and 13 regained limited ROM. Good functional results were obtained with this treatment plan in lieu of amputation, which previously was the most likely treatment.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility and biochemical properties of Streptococcus faecalis strains reacting with both D and G antisera.
AB  - Thirty one of 60 consecutive isolates of Streptococcus faecalis produced a reaction in both D and G streptococcal grouping sera. A close correlation was found between this grouping reaction and haemolysin production, resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim, and delayed fermentation of sorbitol.
TI  - Colonization and persistence of Escherichia coli in axenic and monoxenic turkeys.
AB  - Sites of colonization and persistence of virulent (O78) and avirulent (O2) Escherichia coli were determined in 3-week-old axenic turkeys. Colonization of O78 in turkeys infected with Streptococcus faecalis was also determined. Colonization and persistence of E coli in the intestinal tract and lung were not correlated with virulence. Both serotypes persisted in high titer in crop, ileum, ceca, colon, and lung. Persistence of E coli in the liver was positively correlated with virulence, although both serotypes were recovered from the liver in the absence of bacteremia, indicating possible intestinal translocation of E coli to the liver. A reduction in intestinal colonization and translocation of O78 was determined in monoxenic turkeys infected with S faecalis. In contrast, S faecalis had no effect on lung titers of O78. Air sacculitis, pericarditis, and pneumonia were observed in axenic and monoxenic turkeys infected with O78. Bacteremia was detected in a turkey exposed to O78.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against uropathogenic organisms].
AB  - Ciprofloxacin (Bay 09867) is a new quinoline derivative. Its activity against 537 urinary bacterial isolates was compared with those of ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate. It inhibited 90% Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., E, coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Serratia spp. at less than or equal to 0.78 microgram/ml. The majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin-resistant strains, was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.12 micrograms/ml. MICs of Bay 09867 for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus faecalis were 0.78 micrograms/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml respectively. Bay 09867 inhibited organisms resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic and oxolinic acids and trimethoprim.
TI  - A new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  - Several tests, bacitracin, CAMP, pyroglutamic acid-B-naphthylamide test (PYR test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. Bacitracin correctly identified all of the group A streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group A. The PYR reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group A streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. The PYR reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Both the salt tolerance test and the PYR reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group D streptococci as non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Pigment production by group B streptococci was more reliable than the CAMP test for identifying group B streptococci. The combination of PYR, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.
TI  - [Concentration profiles of putrescine and cadaverine in inoculated vacuum packed  beef].
AB  - The potential of some Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains for producing putrescine and cadavering during growth in vacuum packed beef was studied. Throughout the six weeks storage at 4 degrees C the samples were sensorily assessed at regular intervals, and their pH values and diamine contents were determined. The amines were quantified by means of capillary gas chromatography. The putrescine and cadaverine contents remained within the range of the initial values until overt spoilage at the end of the sixth week (at about 0.08 mg amine/100 g).
TI  - Quality control of susceptibility tests with 5-micrograms trimethoprim disks.
AB  - In 1981 and again in 1984, we performed multi-laboratory studies to develop quality control limits for susceptibility tests with 5-micrograms trimethoprim disks. Zone size limits of 21 to 28 mm are recommended for tests with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and limits of 19 to 26 mm are recommended for tests with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. For screening Mueller-Hinton agar, tests with Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 33186 or ATCC 29212 are recommended: zones should be fairly clear and greater than or equal to 22 mm (trimethoprim disks) or greater than or equal to 24 mm (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole disks).
TI  - Interaction of anti-kojibiose antibody with the lipoteichoic acids from Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Antisera prepared in rabbits by immunization with p-aminophenyl beta-kojibioside  conjugated to bovine serum albumin (antikojibiose sera), readily agglutinated whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus faecium, and showed specific reactions with the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) of these streptococci by passive hemagglutination, microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The interaction of the antikojibiose sera with the LTAs was inhibited best by kojibiose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-D-glucose], somewhat less by the dextran from which the kojibiose was prepared, and not measurably by maltose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucose]. The sera reacted only minimally in only the most sensitive assay (microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with LTA from group A streptococci (this LTA contains a single kojibiosyl residue as part of the glycolipid moiety of the molecule and failed to react with the Lactobacillus fermentum LTA which is substituted with alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----2)-D -glucosyl units.
TI  - The activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin alone and in combination with gentamicin or ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in vitro activities of vancomycin and teicoplanin against 56 strains of Streptococcus faecalis were compared. Killing curves showed that vancomycin and teicoplanin were bacteriostatic and that synergy was achieved when each was combined with gentamicin. The bactericidal activity displayed by 4 mg/l of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis was antagonized by 4 mg/l of vancomycin and 0.5 mg/l of teicoplanin respectively.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin against aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli and other clinical isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin was tested against 500 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to one or more of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, and against 1060 recent consecutive clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Enoxacin was active against staphylococci (MICs less than or equal to 4 mg/l) but less active against Streptococcus faecalis (MICs mostly 8 mg/l). It was active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 0.5-4 mg/l) and very active against Enterobacteriaceae. In the series of consecutive isolates 97% of Enterobacteriaceae had MICs less than or equal to 1 mg/l. The aminoglycoside-resistant series of Enterobacteriaceae included more strains with higher MICs (13% were 2-4 mg/l and 10% were greater than or equal to 8 mg/l); the majority of the isolates with MICs greater than or equal to 8 mg/l); the majority of the isolates with MICs greater than or equal to 8 mg/l were Serratia marcescens and Providencia spp. Among the non-fermenting species the least sensitive were Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Ps. maltophilia. Enoxacin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to nalidixic acid, but nalidixic acid-resistant strains ranged from fully sensitive to highly resistant to enoxacin.
TI  - Influence of growth medium on the in vitro activities of second- and third-generation cephalosporins against Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The influence of culture medium of the MICs of eight cephalosporins for 45 strains of Streptococcus faecalis was investigated. The MICs of cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefoperazone were not substantially influenced by the type of culture medium used. In contrast, MICs of cefuroxime, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone varied markedly with both the commercial brand and the blood content of the broth used. The use of Mueller-Hinton broths (from Oxoid Ltd., GIBCO Diagnostics, and Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 5% lysed sheep blood frequently resulted in MICs that were greater than or equal to 16 times lower than the MICs obtained with these same broths without blood. Similar, but less marked, patterns were observed when supplemented and unsupplemented brain heart infusion and Sceptor broths were used. The influence of the broth on MICs suggests a complex interaction between some cephalosporins, medium components, and organisms. The cephalosporins that were affected by media share an identical moiety at the 7-acyl position (cefuroxime is slightly different), but this structure is not shared by those cephalosporins that were not affected. This commonality in structure at the 7-acyl position may be partially responsible for the observed results.
TI  - Role of enterococcus in intraabdominal sepsis.
AB  - Although enterococcus is well recognized as a pathogen in endocarditis, urinary tract infections, and biliary sepsis, its role in other forms of intraabdominal sepsis remains controversial. Antibiotics that lack activity against enterococcus can often be employed successfully in intraabdominal infections, even when enterococci are present as part of the polymicrobial flora. Furthermore, the enterococcus rarely emerges as a blood borne pathogen in such a setting. Breakthrough enterococcal septicemia may occur, however, in the immunodepressed host, particularly in the face of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy not specific for enterococcus. Like infections with other opportunistic pathogens, enterococcal sepsis under these circumstances carries a high mortality. Specific antienterococcal drug therapy may be indicated as an adjunct to surgical management in selected patients with intraabdominal sepsis.
TI  - Comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct Lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.
AB  - Simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [IF]) and latex agglutination (LA). IF was not evaluated for Lancefield group D strains (a total of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. IF was least sensitive for the identification of Lancefield group F, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group F reagent. Since LA was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. Of 11 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the LA group C reagent, a problem not observed with IF. However, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. Of the 12 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group D reagent, but all were correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. Of 12 group A strains, 1 was not detected. Of all 113 strains tested by LA, eliminating S. faecalis and S. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. LA was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to IF. When LA is used, the group D reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group C reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. Tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. Rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of Pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. Cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. Rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. The abundance of Micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of M. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. The abundance of R. leguminosarum fell in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. Populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. S. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Hemolysin of Streptococcus faecalis subspecies zymogenes contributes to virulence in mice.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pAD1 (56.7 kilobases) in Streptococcus faecalis confers hemolysin-bacteriocin (Hly-Bcn) expression and a mating response to the sex pheromone cAD1 excreted by recipient cells. We examined the contribution of hemolysin to pathogenicity in intraperitoneally infected mice by using Tn916 and Tn917 insertion mutants altered in hemolysin expression. Strains exhibiting the normal hemolysin phenotype were significantly more virulent than the nonhemolytic insertion mutants. A mutant plasmid with an increased copy number which gave rise to a larger-than-normal zone of hemolysis on blood agar rendered host strains more virulent than the wild-type streptococci in mice.
TI  - Altered expression of the H+ ATPase in Streptococcus faecalis membranes.
AB  - Evidence is presented that expression of the H+ ATPase in S. faecalis is influenced by the extracellular pH and K+ level during growth. Altered expression was detected by assay of F1 ATPase and electrophoretic analysis of membrane proteins. K+-limited growth caused about a 2-fold increase in the F1 ATPase. The effect of growth at pH 6, 7 and 9 was studied. Compared to cells grown at pH 7, growth at pH 6 increased the F1 ATPase about 2-fold while growth at pH 9 reduced the F1 ATPase by nearly 4-fold. The elevated F1 ATPase activity in the pH 6 cells was associated with an increase in the F1 ATPase alpha and beta subunits in the membrane while the decrease in F1 ATPase in the pH 9 cells was associated with a marked loss of the alpha subunit. It is suggested that intracellular protons may act as effectors which regulate expression of the F1F0 gene cluster at the level of translation.
TI  - Drug resistance in Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - A total of 1,278 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 688 of Str. faecium and 796 of Staphylococcus epidermidis were collected from laboratory animals of 20 colonies in 1980, and tested for their resistance to 20 drugs. Thirteen percent of Str. faecalis, 12% of Str. faecium and 25% of Staph. epidermidis were drug resistant. Multiple drug resistant organisms were frequently detected in laboratory animal colonies where antibiotic treatment had been undertaken. TC-resistant streptococci and EM-resistant Staph. epidermidis were distributed in about half of the colonies regardless of the history of antibiotic usage.
TI  - A turbidimetric and electron microscopic study of the effects of several parameters on the lysis of Streptococcus faecalis by lysozyme.
AB  - The lytic effect of lysozyme on Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was studied by spectrophotometry and electron microscopy and it was found to be highly dependent on the ionic strength of the suspending media and on the ratio lysozyme to bacterial cell mass. When 7.2 X 10(8) bacteria/mL are exposed to 0.4 mg/mL of lysozyme in media with low ionic strength, the enzyme is bound in great amounts, as deduced from protein determinations and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS--PAGE); the binding prevents bacteriolysis in spite of the removal of the cell wall. Extensive lysis of S. faecalis could be obtained by reducing the ratio of lysozyme to bacterial cell mass. Stabilization of S. faecalis by lysozyme was also observed when exponential phase cells incubated under conditions that promote spontaneous autolysis (incubation in 0.05 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, pH 8.0, ionic strength = 0.01675) do not lyse and do not leak material which absorbs at 260 nm when lysozyme was present at the highest concentration.
TI  - Emerging patterns of microbial resistance.
AB  - Microbial resistance arises by mutation or by inheritance. The latter is plasmid-mediated and transferable and may erode multidrug resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim. Resistance genes may transfer from one plasmid to another or from a plasmid to the chromosome or to a bacteriophage, thereby allowing rapid dissemination of resistance among bacteria. Mutational or chromosomal resistance is not readily transferable between different bacterial species or genera but is nonetheless medically important for resistance to isoniazid, methicillin, nalidixic acid, rifampin, and expanded spectrum cephalosporins.
TI  - Scanning electron microscopy detects bacteria within infection stones.
AB  - The viability and location of bacteria within infection stones were investigated. Many stones were infected with urea-splitting bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Large numbers of bacterial impressions and bodies were found in the interstices surrounded by crystals of apatite and struvite from the nuclei to the peripheral layers. The presence of bacterial colonies even in the nuclear portion of the stones suggests that bacteria participate in the initial stone formation as well as in growth of infection stones. Streptococcus faecalis, a nonurea -splitting bacteria, also was found in some infection stones and probably represents a superimposed infection as a result of changes in bacterial flora owing to treatment with antibiotics.
TI  - Regeneration of insertionally inactivated streptococcal DNA fragments after excision of transposon Tn916 in Escherichia coli: strategy for targeting and cloning of genes from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative transposon Tn916 (15 kilobases), originally identified in Streptococcus faecalis DS16, has been cloned as an intact element on the pBR322-derived vector pGL101 in Escherichia coli. The EcoRI F' (EcoRI F::Tn916) fragment of pAM211 (pAD1::Tn916) was cloned into the single EcoRI site of pGL101 to form the chimera, pAM120, by selecting for the expression of Tn916-encoded tetracycline resistance (Tcr). Interestingly, in the absence of continued selection for Tcr, Tn916 excised from pAM120 at high frequency. This excision event resulted in a plasmid species consisting of the pGL101 vector and a 2.7-kilobase restriction fragment comigrating with the EcoRI F fragment of pAD1 during agarose gel electrophoresis. Filter blot hybridization experiments showed the 2.7-kilobase fragment generated as a result of Tn916 excision to be homologous with the EcoRI F fragment of pAD1. Analogous results were obtained with another chimera, pAM170, generated by ligating the EcoRI D' (EcoRI D::Tn916) fragment of pAM210 (pAD1::Tn916) to EcoRI-digested pGL101. Comparison of the AluI and RsaI cleavage patterns of the EcoRI F fragment isolated after Tn916 excision with those from an EcoRI F fragment derived from pAD1 failed to detect any difference in the two fragments: data in support of a precise Tn916 excision event in E. coli. Subcloning experiments showed that an intact transposon was required for Tn916 excision and located the Tcr determinant near the single HindIII site on Tn916. Although excision occurred with high frequency in E. coli, Tn916 insertion into the E. coli chromosome was a much rarer event. Tcr transformants were not obtained when pAM120 DNA was used to transform a polA1 strain, E. coli C2368.

TI  - Effect of media and blood on the antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins on serogroup D streptococci: a review.
AB  - The influence of culture medium on in vitro of selected cephalosporins on on group D streptococci was investigated by agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. The activity of cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefoperazone were not substantially influenced by the type of culture medium used, but cefuroxime, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime (CTX), cefmenoxime, and ceftriaxone varied markedly with both the commercial brand and the blood content of the broth used. The differences were more likely to occur in some Mueller-Hinton media, particularly when supplemented with 5% lysed sheep blood, and resulted in susceptible results instead of the resistant results that were obtained with these same media without blood. Some strains of Streptococcus faecalis showed these discrepancies, but S. bovis did not. The influence of the media on in vitro activity suggests a complex interaction between some cephalosporins, media components, and organisms. The cephalosporins that were affected by media share an identical moiety at the 7-acyl position (cefuroxime is slightly different); this structure is not shared by those cephalosporins that were not affected, however. It is possible that this structure may play a part in the phenomenon.
TI  - Emergence of Streptococcus faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to multiple aminocyclitol aminoglycosides.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus faecalis were occasionally found to be resistant to gentamicin concentrations of 500 micrograms/ml in a microdilution tray. Additional tests were performed with 28 such isolates. They all demonstrated high-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, sisomicin, streptomycin, and tobramycin. This high-level aminoglycoside resistance was associated with total resistance to in vitro synergism when each aminoglycoside was combined with ampicillin. In addition to ampicillin-aminoglycoside combinations, ampicillin-vancomycin, ampicillin-rifampin, rifampin-vancomycin, and vancomycin-gentamicin combinations were also tested; all failed to exhibit an in vitro synergistic-bactericidal effect against these enterococci. The emergence of enterococci with high-level resistance to multiple aminoglycosides in this clinical population is a source of grave concern with obvious therapeutic implications in situations such as endocarditis, where an in vitro bactericidal effect is thought to be necessary for a cure. No drug or combination of drugs was found to be bactericidal for these isolates. It is suspected that similar isolates of group D streptococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin may emerge in other institutions but go unrecognized. Surveillance by others for identifying this newly emerging pathogen carrying multiple resistance and a continued search for a satisfactory chemotherapeutic agent(s) are encouraged.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the pAD1 pheromone response in Streptococcus faecalis, using  transposon Tn917 as an insertional mutagen.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pAD1 (56.7 kilobases) in Streptococcus faecalis has been  shown to confer a mating response to the sex pheromone cAD1 excreted by recipient strains. The response is characterized by the synthesis of a proteinaceous adhesin which coats the surface of the pAD1 -containing donor cell and facilitates the formation of mating aggregates. Donors exposed to cAD1 -containing filtrates of recipients undergo self-aggregation (clumping), an event believed to be associated with an interaction between the adhesin and a binding substance always present on the surface of both recipients and donors. To analyze the molecular processes involved in the mating response, mutants were generated by the erythromycin resistance transposon Tn917 . Transpositions to pAD1 in S. faecalis DS16 gave rise to a number of derivatives that exhibited "constitutive clumping" and the ability to transfer at high frequencies in short (10-min) matings. These mutants fell into two subclasses, which exhibited colony morphologies that were "dry" or "normal". The Tn917 insertions were mapped by restriction enzyme analysis to two separate clusters, designated traA and traB. The dry colony subclass corresponded to traA and represented a span of 1.5 kilobases, whereas the normal subclass corresponded to traB and spanned 1.3 kilobases. The two clusters were separated by 1.7 kilobases in which insertions of Tn917 did not affect the ability to respond normally to cAD1 . Neither type of constitutive clumper produced cAD1 . Another series of insertions exhibited reduced donor potential. In two cases, the reduction in transfer was three to four orders of magnitude; these mapped in traA . In two other cases, the reduction was one to two orders of magnitude. These mapped outside of traA and traB, and one was associated with an increase in plasmid copy number.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1 contains an erythromycin resistance transposon (Tn3871) similar to transposon Tn917.
AB  - The R plasmid pJH1 contains a 5.1-kilobase transposon ( Tn3871 ) that mediates inducible resistance to erythromycin. Three AvaI digestion fragments from this transposon are identical in size to and homologous with three AvaI-derived fragments from the previously described erythromycin resistance transposon Tn917 . These three DNA fragments account for greater than 90% of both transposons.
TI  - Amplification of the Streptococcus faecalis proton-translocating ATPase by a decrease in cytoplasmic pH.
AB  - When Streptococcus faecalis was grown in the presence of protonophores , an ATPase activity of the membrane was increased at a pH below 8.0 but not at a pH above 8.0. Characteristics of this increased ATPase were identical to those of a proton-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase) located on the membrane of normal cells. The cytoplasmic pH was regulated at 7.6 to 7.8 but was not regulated in the presence of protonophores . The increase in the H+-ATPase was observed when the cytoplasmic pH was lowered to less than 7.6 by the addition of protonophores and was not related to the dissipation of the proton motive force. Thus, we suggest that the H+-ATPase of the membrane is amplified when the cytoplasmic pH is lowered below the pH at which it is regulated under normal conditions.
TI  - Sodium-stimulated ATPase in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We measured Na+-stimulated ATPase activity in a mutant of Streptococcus faecalis  defective in the generation of proton motive force. The activity in membrane vesicles was 62.1 +/- 5.9 nmol of phosphate produced per min per mg of protein when cells were grown on medium containing 0.12 M Na+. Activity decreased as the concentration of Na+ in the growth medium decreased. The decrease in enzyme activity corresponded to the decrease in transport activity for Na+ in both whole cells and membrane vesicles. The effects of pH on both activities were identical. Thus, it is suggested that Na+ movement is mediated by this enzyme. Sodium extrusion and ATPase activity in the wild-type strain were markedly lower than those observed in the mutant strain. Elevated activities of both Na+ extrusion and Na+-stimulated ATPase could be detected in the wild-type strain when cells were grown in the absence of proton motive force. Thus, we propose that the level of ATPase is increased by dissipation of the proton motive force.
TI  - Cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime: an example of advantageous antimicrobial metabolism.
AB  - Although the antibacterial activity of desacetylcefotaxime (des-CTX), the principal metabolite of cefotaxime (CTX), is eightfold lower than cefotaxime, the metabolite inhibits many B-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and unusual Pseudomonas species resistant to agents such as cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefoperazone. des-CTX is more stable than CTX to attack by beta-lactamases of some species such as Bacteroides fragilis, Proteus vulgaris, and the k-1 enzyme of Enterobacter-Klebsiella. des-CTX acts synergistically with CTX against many Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus faecalis. The antibacterial activity of the combination of CTX/des-CTX indicates that the drug can be administered every 8-12 hr and provides excellent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

AB  
TI  - Control of wall band splitting in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Computer reconstructions of 659 and 1325 whole mounted, shadowed cells, randomly  chosen from cultures of Streptococcus faecalis undergoing balanced growth and doubling in mass every 83 min and 30 min, respectively, were used to analyse the cell cycle. The size limits and duration of phases of the cell cycle were estimated by applying a method previously described by the authors, details of which are given here to allow others to use the method. Deeply constricted cells whose primary septal radius, Rs, was less than or equal to 0.18 micron were considered as belonging to an E-phase ending the cell cycle. The statistical parameters of these E-phase cells were used to calculate the mean and coefficient of variation of dividing cells. These latter values, in turn, predicted the moments of the total population well enough so that the method's assumptions were judged adequately satisfied. Therefore, the method was considered applicable to other phases and sub-phases of the cell cycle of these two cultures. The E-phase cells were further classified as having either 0, 1 or 2 secondary growth zones, allowing us to calculate the percentage of newborn cells without growth zones. In the slow-growing cells, 69% of the cells arose with no growth zone. On the other hand, in more rapidly growing cells 16% of the cells or less arose with no growth zone. Our calculations showed that they could exist without a growth zone for only 2 and 0.1 min, respectively. We also classified cells as possessing a 'birth site' if the volume between the two daughter bands was greater than 0, but less than 0.06 micron3. From the statistical properties of such cells with new growth zones, the mean pole time, W, was estimated. We also estimated W from the size of cells in E-phase. The major conclusion is that the pole time is only slightly greater than the mass doubling time at both growth rates. Since DNA synthesis in S. faecalis takes longer (C = 50 to 52 min) than the mass doubling time in rich medium (30 min), a new round of chromosome replication must be initiated before the old round of synthesis is completed (dichotomous replication). Consequently, wall band splitting and initiation of chromosome replication do not occur simultaneously. It was also concluded that the cell initiates wall band splitting, resulting in pole formation and cell division, when the growth zones cannot function rapidly enough to allow the increase of surface area required to accommodate continuing production of cytoplasm.
TI  - Susceptibilities of enterococci to twelve antibiotics.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 347 urine isolates of enterococci (Streptococcus faecalis, 44%; S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes, 37%; S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens, 19%) to ampicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rosaramicin, rifampin, rifampin plus trimethoprim (1:4), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1:20), and chloramphenicol were determined by the agar dilution technique. There were no significant differences in susceptibility to individual agents among the subspecies of S. faecalis. Azlocillin and mezlocillin (MIC for 90% of isolates, 0.78 micrograms/ml) and piperacillin, ampicillin, and vancomycin (MIC for 90% of isolates, 1.56 micrograms/ml) were the most active agents and were significantly more potent than the other reference antibiotics tested.
TI  - Comparative efficacies of mezlocillin and ampicillin alone or in combination with gentamicin in the treatment of Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of mezlocillin and ampicillin, alone and in combination with gentamicin, against Streptococcus faecalis were compared. In vitro, relative bactericidal and activities for 10 strains of S. faecalis were as follows: mezlocillin plus gentamicin greater than ampicillin plus gentamicin (P is not significant) greater than mezlocillin (P less than 0.01) greater than ampicillin (P less than 0.01) greater than gentamicin (P less than 0.01) greater than control (P less than 0.01). One of the strains was used to induce endocarditis in rabbits. Infected rabbits were treated by random selection with ampicillin, mezlocillin, ampicillin plus gentamicin, mezlocillin plus gentamicin, or saline (control) for 7 days. Among antibiotic-treated rabbits, survival rates were the same, but ampicillin was less effective than the other regimens in sterilizing both blood cultures (P less than 0.001 on day 4) and cardiac vegetations (P less than 0.05 on day 7). Differences in quantitative vegetation cultures among rabbits treated with mezlocillin, mezlocillin plus gentamicin, or ampicillin plus gentamicin and sacrificed on day 7 were not significantly different. Peak inhibitory and bactericidal antibacterial activity titers in serum determined during treatment were higher with mezlocillin (with or without gentamicin) than with ampicillin (with or without gentamicin) (P less than 0.01). Mezlocillin may be more effective than ampicillin in the treatment of S. faecalis infections in humans.
TI  - Distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  - The gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. Gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. A colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Fusobacterium sp. was established. These gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. Except for the presence of large numbers of Bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of S. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. Bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism in conventional gerbils. Microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. Intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. Intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils were similar. Histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. Spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. Statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  - Kinetic analysis of tetracycline accumulation by Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Tetracycline transport by Streptococcus faecalis occurs by an energy-dependent, carrier-mediated process. The Michaelis constant for transport was unchanged, but the maximal velocity was increased when an energy source, glucose, was present. Accumulation levels, sometimes 25-fold greater than the external concentration, were controlled by the transport system.
TI  - Experimental pyelonephritis. The effect of T-cell deficiency on the course of hematogenous enterococcal pyelonephritis in the mouse.
AB  - The course of experimental hematogenous pyelonephritis due to Streptococcus faecalis was compared in athymic (nu/nu) mice and euthymic (nu/+) littermates. Up to 7 weeks following infection, there were no significant differences in renal microbial populations. At 63 and 107-131 days there was significant escalation of infection in nu/nu mice, while the nu/+ mice were decreasing their infections. There was no increase in gross abscess formation in nu/nu mice, but in late stages significantly more gross scarring occurred in nu/nu as compared with nu/+ mice. Microscopically there was also greater scarring in nu/nu mice late in the disease, except for calyceal lesions. The data suggest that immunologic factors (T cells) are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic pyelonephritis.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis proton gradients and tetracycline transport.
AB  - The transport of chlortetracycline by Streptococcus faecalis is energy dependent. Addition of glucose to energy-depleted cells enhances both the transport rates and accumulation levels. Transport rates can be altered independently of glucose by treating cells with ionophores that increase or decrease the proton gradient. The transport of the antibiotic is linked only to the transmembrane pH difference, delta pH, and not the transmembrane electrical potential, delta psi. This conclusion was verified by quantitative measurements of delta pH, delta psi, and tetracycline accumulation levels. A linear correlation between delta pH and the tetracycline electrochemical potential was observed. Tetracycline most likely accumulates by the symport of protons in which the protons are bound to an anionic form of the antibiotic to form an uncharged molecule.
TI  - Introduction of pAM beta 1 into Listeria monocytogenes by conjugation and homology between native L. monocytogenes plasmids.
AB  - The broad host range antibiotic resistance plasmid pAM beta 1 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to 9 of 15 Listeria monocytogenes strains by conjugation. L. monocytogenes transconjugates could transfer the plasmid either among L. monocytogenes strains or back to S. faecalis. Transfer between the various strains occurred without any detectable plasmid DNA rearrangements. The pAM beta 1 replicon was stable in L. monocytogenes--it was retained without antibiotic selection when the bacteria were grown in culture media or passed in mice--and the presence of pAM beta 1 had no major effect on L. monocytogenes virulence. These data suggest that pAM beta 1 or its derivatives might serve as useful L. monocytogenes cloning vehicles. The data presented also demonstrate that pAM beta 1 is compatible with two different native L. monocytogenes plasmids and that Listeria species harbor native plasmids in addition to the 38.5-megadalton plasmid pRYC16 previously reported by Perez-Diaz et al. (J. C. Perez-Diaz, M. F. Vicente, and F. Banquero, Plasmid 8:112-118, 1982). Of 29 L. monocytogenes strains screened, 7 contained plasmid DNA. Four strains had similar if not identical plasmids that were 34 megadaltons in size, whereas three other strains contained either a 53-, 44-, or 32-megadalton plasmid; none of these plasmids has the same restriction patterns as pRYC16. DNA homology experiments indicate that the various plasmids are related and suggest that there may be a common set of sequences present in all of the plasmids examined.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of teichomycin and vancomycin alone and in combination with rifampin and aminoglycosides against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - The activity of teichomycin A2 was compared with that of vancomycin in vitro against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. Teichomycin A2 was more active than vancomycin active against all isolates tested. Synergistic studies also demonstrated that teichomycin A2 combined with rifampin is more active than vancomycin combined with rifampin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Teichomycin A2, either singly or in combination with an aminoglycoside, was more active against Streptococcus faecalis isolates.
TI  - Echocardiographic features of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis.
AB  - Abnormal echocardiographic findings in seven cases of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis were confirmed in six at operation. The echocardiograms showed three cases with thickening and increased echo intensity (group 1) and four (group 2) in which vegetations were seen initially without either of the two features in group 1. Two patients in group 1 had vegetations, the causative organism being a streptococcus. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative organism in three of the four cases in group 2; in two of these rapidly growing vegetations were detected. The large vegetations obstructed the ostium of the bioprosthetic valve. Thus if vegetations are detected in cases in which staphylococci are the causative bacteria surgery should be performed as soon as possible. In patients who develop a fever after bioprosthetic valve replacement and especially in those with evident bacteraemia echocardiography should be repeated frequently so that lesions may be detected early.
TI  - Ribosomal resistance of clinical enterococcal to streptomycin isolates.
AB  - The mechanism of high-level resistance to streptomycin was studied in 12 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis. Six strains produced streptomycin-modifying enzymes. Each of three enzyme-negative strains tested demonstrated ribosomal resistance to streptomycin. Lack of ribosomal susceptibility is a significant cause of high-level streptomycin resistance among clinical enterococcal isolates.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to immunodeterminants of lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Murine hybrid cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies directed against determinants present on lipoteichoic acids were generated. Hapten inhibition studies showed that one group of monoclonal antibodies was inhibited by deacylated cardiolipin, and the second group was inhibited by kojibiose. Thus, antibodies directed against the polyglycerophosphate chain, which is common to the lipoteichoic acids of many gram-positive species, and against the streptococcal group D antigen were obtained.
TI  - Evaluation of a surfactant mixture C31G as a teat dip by a modified excised teat  model.
AB  - A mixture of amphoteric surfactants with antimicrobial properties, C31G, was evaluated as a teat dip by a modified excised teat model. The model was modified to avoid misinterpretation of results from indigenous bacterial microflora on teats. In three experiments, bacterial numbers recovered from teats dipped in .75, 1.5, and 3.0% solutions of C31G were compared with bacteria recovered from undipped teats (negative controls) and teats dipped with 1.0% iodophor (an effective teat dip). Mean log reductions of teat end concentrations of Staphylococcus, aureus, Streptococcus fecalis, and Escherichia coli were determined in each experiment. Efficacy was greatest for the 3.0% solution of C31G with mean log reductions (Log reduction = Log 10 of controls - Log 10 of dipped teats) 3.53 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.89 for Streptococcus fecalis, and 3.16 for Escherichia coli. Iodophor (1%) yielded mean log reductions of 3.26 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.16 for Streptococcus fecalis, and 2.83 for Escherichia coli. For all three organisms, number of viable organisms decreased with increasing concentrations of C31G. The efficacy of C31G should be evaluated in vivo.
TI  - Rutin-induced beta-glucosidase activity in Streptococcus faecium VGH-1 and Streptococcus sp. strain FRP-17 isolated from human feces: formation of the mutagen, quercetin, from rutin.
AB  - A fecal isolate, Streptococcus sp. strain FRP-17, and strain VGH-1 of Streptococcus faecium were shown to contain beta-glucosidases which converted rutin (quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucose-alpha-L-rhamnose) to quercetin and were active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucose. The activity against rutin could be measured by increased mutagenicity in the Ames assay or visualized on thin-layer chromatography plates. In both organisms, the beta-glucosidase activities were inducible by the addition of rutin to the growth media. Several closely related strains of Streptococcus spp. lacked any beta-glucosidase activity. In cell preparations of the active organisms, activities with rutin and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucose were optimal at pH 6.8 and could be enhanced by increasing the ionic strength of the assay system. At low ionic strengths, both quercetin and a new product (intermediate between the polarities of rutin and quercetin) were formed by the incubation of rutin with cell preparations of either active organism. This product disappeared with increased ionic strength, suggesting that it may be a reaction intermediate, quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucose. These results suggest that the beta-glucosidase active against rutin and that active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucose are the same.
TI  - Comparative activity of imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) on enterococci and its interactions with aminoglycosides.
AB  - Activity of imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin, ampicillin and vancomycin against 27 Streptococcus faecalis and 5 Str. faecium was determined. Also evaluated were the interactions of imipenem, ampicillin and vancomycin with streptomycin or amikacin or sissomicin. Imipenem showed the most inhibitory activity against Str. faecalis with MIC50 and MIC90 values 0.5 and 2 mg/l respectively, Str. faecium strains were less susceptible to imipenem with MIC50/MIC90 values of 2/16 mg/l. Imipenem showed good bactericidal activity against both groups of strains with MBC50/MBC90 values of 1/4 and 4/16 mg/l respectively. The most favourable interactions (synergy and addition) of imipenem were with streptomycin (72.2%) and sissomicin (53.2%). Combinations containing amikacin were the least favourable. Similar results were obtained with these combinations against Str. faecium.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of Staphylococcus aureus on sensitivity testing agar by Streptococcus faecalis var zymogenes.
AB  
TI  - Interpretive standards and quality control limits for susceptibility tests with ampicillin-sulbactam combination disks.
AB  - In vitro studies were performed to evaluate susceptibility tests with disks containing 10 micrograms of ampicillin plus 10 micrograms of sulbactam. Interpretive zone standards of less than or equal to 11 mm (resistant), 12 to 13 mm (intermediate), and greater than or equal to 14 mm (susceptible) are proposed. A nine-laboratory coordinated study was performed to establish tentative zone size limits for quality control of ampicillin-sulbactam disks. This included data with a new control strain selected to monitor performance of such combination disks.
TI  - Physical and genetic analyses of streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 and cloning of  its replication region.
AB  - Plasmid pAM beta 1, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis DS5, mediates resistance to the MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B alpha) group of antibiotics. A restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pAM beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes AvaI, HpaII, EcoRI, PvuII, Kpn1, BstEII, HpaI, HhaI, and HindIII. A comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pAM beta 1 located the MLS resistance determinant within a 2-kb DNA segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb Escherichia coli plasmid vector, pACKC1, and used to transform E. coli HB101. The 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform Streptococcus sanguis Challis with concurrent expression of the E. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of Streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid DNA. Subcloning experiments, using a HindIII partial digest of pAM beta 1 DNA, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.
TI  - [The antibacterial action of calcium hydroxide].
AB  
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci.
AB  
TI  - [Bacterial flora and its sensitivity to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children].
AB  - The main bacteria causing urinary tract infections in children we found: Enterobacteriaceae (75%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11,8%), Staphylococcus albus K- (5%) and Streptococcus faecalis (4%). Antibiotic sensitivity of 1362 strains of bacteria isolated from urinary tract of children treated in National Research Institute of Mother and Child in 1979-1981 were evaluated. Sensitivity on 12 chemiotherapeutics were checked. Aminoglycoside antibiotics: tobramycin and gentamycin were found as the most efficient ones. Over 50% of bacteria strains showed sensitivity on negram, nitrofurantoin, colimycin, cephradin and carbenicillin. Fewest bacteria strains gave evidence of penicillin, ampicillin, biseptol and vibramycin sensitivity.
TI  - Toxicity of microbial products in cell culture.
AB  - Cytotoxicity of a mixed pyrogen preparation and its components as well as native  and radiodetoxified lipopolysacharides (LPS) was determined with established HEp-2 cell cultures and by measuring plating efficiency. This proved to be more sensitive to the damaging effect of both microbe-containing LPS (Escherichia coli) and purified LPS. Microorganisms without this compound (Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis) seem to be more infifferent on cells, even Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a marked augmenting effect on cell plating. Divergence in null-toxicity between the established cultures and plating efficiency makes it possible to presume that the primary effect of microorganisms on epithelial cells is medited by LPS, and the subsequent liberation of lysosomal proteinases is responsible for major biological effects.
TI  - The effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  - Previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. Removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. Exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore Escherichia coli adherence to control levels. To determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozonae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. Bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3H-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Results were as follows: Acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. Briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except Pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. Heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except Pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. The magnitude of Klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. While this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against Pseudomonas.
TI  - Immune interferon production by TH69, a lyophilized preparation of Streptococcus  faecalis, in murine spleen cell cultures.
AB  - In mouse spleen cell cultures, TH69, a live Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 31663) preparation, at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml induced immune interferon (IFN gamma) with molecular weight ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 daltons together with a small amount of IFN alpha/beta. By using nonsensitized mouse spleen cells, the fact that both T-cells and macrophages are required for this IFN production was established. When these spleen cells were obtained from mice sensitized 12 days earlier with 4 mg of TH69, twice as much IFN was produced than in cells obtained from nonsensitized mice. This increase was explained by the presence of both sensitized macrophages and T-cells in a reconstitution experiment.
TI  - Incubation temperature and faecal streptococci recovery from marine sediments.
AB  - A comparative work was carried out on two different incubation temperatures that  may be used for faecal streptococci recovery. Analyses were made on sediments samples collected in the bay of Naples in a larger survey of environmental pollution detection. Results showed a selective effect of 44 degrees C temperature on the isolation of the Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus durans species that may be considered properly faecal streptococci.
TI  - Acquisition of K:1-like antigen during terminal sepsis.
AB  - This report describes a patient whose own and transfused K:-1 red cell populations became strongly K:1 during a terminal episode of sepsis due to a group D streptococcus organism, Streptococcus faecium. Subsequent in vitro studies using normal K:-1 red cells inoculated with that organism showed that it could render the red cells agglutinable by reagents containing IgG anti-K1. In addition, disrupted S. faecium organisms rendered Jkb-negative red cells agglutinable by those reagents.
TI  - Plasmids in Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes: transferability and molecular properties.
AB  - Seven strains of Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes were studied. Plasmids originally harboured by these bacteria, codifing for drug resistance, hemolysin and gelatinase activity, were transferred to a recipient strain ( JH2 -2) by conjugation. Studies on bacteria in mating showed the formation of protoplasmatic bridges between donors and recipients; these bridges should provide for the passage of genetic material. Kinetics of acquisition of the transferable resistance were carried out in liquid medium. Plasmids harboured in donor and transconjugant strains, responsable for antibiotic-resistance, for hemolysin and gelatinase activity, were analyzed later by agarose gel electrophoresis. These analysis permitted us to demonstrate the presence of many plasmids, some conjugative with a high molecular weight and others small and non-conjugative.
TI  - Non-protein-bound iron within bacterial cells and the action of bleomycin.
AB  - Damage to DNA by bleomycin in vitro is entirely dependent on the presence of an iron salt and molecular oxygen. This same reaction has been used to measure non-protein-bound iron in different bacterial species. Although several of the species examined were insensitive to the toxic effects of bleomycin, they all contained a concentration of non-protein-bound iron which should have been sufficient to allow iron-dependent damage to DNA. Other factors such as permeability or inactivation of the drug must explain their apparent insensitivity.
TI  - Imipenem therapy of experimental Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis.
AB  - Imipenem was very active in vitro against 36 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from  cases of infective endocarditis; the MBC90 was 0.06 mg/l (four- to eight-fold more active than nafcillin). The in-vitro activity of imipenem against 22 Streptococcus faecalis isolates from proven endocarditis cases was similar to that of penicillin G (MBC90 = 8 mg/l). Imipenem was compared with nafcillin and with penicillin plus gentamicin in the therapy of experimental endocarditis induced in rabbits by Staph. aureus and Str. faecalis, respectively. The dosages were chosen to simulate closely serum antibiotic concentrations found in humans receiving standard parenteral regimens. Imipenem was more rapidly bactericidal than nafcillin in experimental staphylococcal endocarditis. The mean +/- S.D. Staph. aureus concentrations within aortic valve vegetations (log10 cfu/g) after 5 days of therapy were as follows: imipenem = 1.39 +/- 0.61 versus nafcillin 2.39 +/- 0.36 (P less than 0.02). Both the imipenem and nafcillin regimens resulted in 'sterile' vegetations in congruent to 50% of rabbits with experimental staphylococcal endocarditis after 5 days of therapy (P greater than 0.05). Imipenem was also equivalent to penicillin plus gentamicin in the therapy of experimental enterococcal endocarditis for 5 days, as assessed by the mean cfu/g vegetation and the percentage of vegetations rendered sterile. However, 7 days of therapy cured experimental enterococcal endocarditis in 72% of rabbits receiving penicillin plus gentamicin versus 20% for imipenem alone (P less than 0.05). Imipenem deserves further evaluation in the therapy of infective endocarditis, both in experimental animal models of infection and in humans. This agent may prove useful in the therapy of staphylococcal endocarditis in a variety of difficult clinical situations. Therapy of enterococcal endocarditis with imipenem alone is not advisable, pending further data.
TI  - Division blocks in temperature-sensitive mutants of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790).
AB  - Two hundred nine temperature-sensitive growth or division (or both) mutants of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 were isolated. These strains were examined for timing of the division block in the cell division cycle. About 42% of the isolates were blocked at terminal stages of cell division. A second large group appeared to be blocked at various stages of septation. Only five of the temperature-sensitive isolates were blocked at a stage before the completion of chromosome replication. Thirty temperature-sensitive isolates lysed after one or more doublings at the nonpermissive temperature.
TI  - Interaction of cefotaxime and aminoglycosides against enterococci in vitro.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of cefotaxime, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin  as well as the combinations of cefotaxime and aminoglycosides were tested against 50 strains of enterococci. Synergy studies were performed by the time-kill method, and with this technique the combination of cefotaxime plus gentamicin appeared to be more active than the combination of cefotaxime plus tobramycin or cefotaxime plus amikacin. Results of this in vitro study suggest cefotaxime and gentamicin may provide some activity against enterococci, although not sufficient to substitute for proven therapy such as penicillin-ampicillin and gentamicin.
TI  - The chromosomal 3',5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase in Streptococcus pneumoniae is closely related to its plasmid-coded homologs in Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The apparently chromosomally encoded 3',5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (type III), from the high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae BM4200, was compared with homologous enzymes coded for by the plasmids pJH1 and pSH2, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, and also found in a wild strain of S. aureus, BM4600. The enzymes appeared to be indistinguishable, and we conclude that the gene encoding 3',5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (type III) can cross generic barriers within gram-positive cocci.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of antimicrobial drugs in simulated urine specimens at various temperatures of incubation.
AB  - A total of 23 antimicrobial drugs were examined for bactericidal activity in midstream-urine against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, or Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 at incubation temperatures of 35, 22, and 7 degrees C, respectively. The majority of chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduced bacterial inocula within 2 h at 35 degrees C. At room temperature, most drugs required 4 h for significant killing activity to ensue. At 7 degrees C only nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, and rifampin were significantly active within 2 to 4 h following exposure. Following prolonged (overnight) incubation at 7 degrees C, however, 10 of 23 drugs (amikacin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, netilmicin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, rifampin, and vancomycin) effected reduction of bacterial colony counts of greater than or equal to 50%. On the basis of these data it is recommended that urine specimens from patients with known antibacterial chemotherapy should not be refrigerated for longer than 2 to 4 h following collection.
TI  - Enumeration and speciation of group D streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall, their susceptibilities to six antibiotics and a comparison with clinical isolates.
AB  - Isolates of group D streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. From below the sewer outfall, Streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, S. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. S. faecalis var. faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where S. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. S. faecalis var. liquefaciens and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. S. faecium and S. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. The use of group D streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. A statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. Resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to which no resistance was detected. Multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the environmental isolates. Even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - DNA interference with radioimmunoassay procedures.
AB  - A bacterial factor preventing precipitation of immune complexes was purified from a culture of Streptococcus faecalis (AK strain) by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and Bio-Gel A-150m columns. The factor was identified as DNA on the basis of its ultraviolet absorption maximum at 260 nm, hydrolysis by deoxyribonuclease, Mr exceeding 1.5 X 10(8), and positive reaction with diphenylamine. DNA interferes with the immunoassay by preventing precipitation of immune complexes. Only double-stranded DNA and polynucleotides showed this property. Evidently, double-stranded DNA will give false-positive interference with the usual RIA procedures.
TI  - High-field phosphorus NMR studies of the stoichiometry of the lactate/proton carrier in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - High-field 31P-NMR studies of whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis have shown that delta pH can be formed by ATP hydrolysis and also by lactate transport. We have used 31P-NMR to measure the pH dependence of the variable stoichiometry of the proton/lactate carrier. At low external pH (pH approximately equal to 6.5) the influx stoichiometry was 1.1 H+/lactate, while at high pH (7.5) the ratio was almost 2; the apparent midpoint pH of this variable stoichiometry is 7. delta psi measurements support the electrogenic nature of lactate transport at high pH; the variable rate of membrane depolarization caused by lactate transport also had a midpoint near pH 7.0. The data is consistent with a symmetrical carrier operating with variable stoichiometry as proposed by Michels et al.
TI  - Synthesis of catalase by "Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes".
AB  - "Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes" was grown aerobically and anaerobically with glycerol as the source of carbon, and in the presence and absence of haematin. Catalase activity was found only during aerobic growth in the presence of haematin. The rate of appearance of catalase activity was measured on (a) addition of haematin to haematin-less aerobic cultures, and (b) aeration of haematin-containing anaerobic cultures in the presence or absence of chloramphenicol. These experiments suggested that apocatalase synthesis was induced by aeration and was not dependent on the presence of haematin in the growth medium. The binding of haem to apocatalase was oxygen dependent.
TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis against streptomycin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - This report describes the capacities of ampicillin, vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and combinations thereof to prevent endocarditis in rabbits challenged with either streptomycin-resistant (three strains) or streptomycin-susceptible (one strain) Streptococcus faecalis. Vancomycin (15 mg/kg) alone was effective in preventing infection with three of four strains, including two which were streptomycin resistant. Vancomycin (30 mg/kg) alone was effective against the other streptomycin-resistant strain. The vancomycin-gentamicin combination was the only therapeutic regimen to demonstrate complete prophylaxis for all strains regardless of streptomycin susceptibility. The ampicillin-gentamicin combination was variably effective despite in vitro synergism.
TI  - The effects of subinhibitory concentrations of various antibiotics on phagocytosis of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - This study reports the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics, clindamycin, gentamicin, moxalactam, and penicillin G, against 6 blood isolates of Streptococcus faecalis to determine possible enhancement of phagocytosis. In addition, combinations of penicillin G plus streptomycin, penicillin G and gentamicin, and clindamycin plus gentamicin were studied to determine synergistic growth inhibition. Results suggest no observable effect in phagocytosis from subinhibitory concentrations of the studied antibiotics singly or in combination. The number of viable intracellular Str. faecalis were also not affected by pre-treatment with antibiotics.
TI  - Medium-dependent zone size discrepancies associated with susceptibility testing of group D streptococci against various cephalosporins.
AB  - Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar media from various commercial sources, either supplemented or not supplemented with 5% sheep blood, were studied to determine their effect on disk diffusion susceptibility testing results obtained with 90 strains of group D streptococci and four cephalosporins. The cephalosporins investigated included cephalothin, cefamandole, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. Results showed that a number of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains were susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime, but the number varied with both the commercial source and blood content of the MH medium used. Regardless of the MH medium used, none of the S. faecalis or S. faecium strains were found to be susceptible to moxalactam. The apparently medium-associated variations in the number of strains susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime were largely due to minor discrepancies (one result being intermediate) among the various types of MH media used. However, major discrepancies (one result being resistant and the other susceptible or vice versa) were observed when S. faecalis strains were tested against cefotaxime. These major discrepancies were associated with both the commercial source of the MH medium and the blood content of the medium.
TI  - Modification of Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromones after acquisition of plasmid DNA.
AB  - Recipient strains of Streptococcus faecalis excrete multiple, peptide sex pheromones that induce mating responses in donors harboring certain conjugative plasmids. Acquisition of plasmid DNA leads to a "shutting off" of pheromone excretion, and such cells become responsive to exogenous pheromone. Data are presented showing that donors excrete low levels of a modified, inactive form of the pheromone. This substance, when mixed in excess with active pheromone, inhibits pheromone activity (probably by competition for a receptor site on the donor). Modified forms of both cPD1 and cAD1 were revealed, and each appeared to have a mass about 350-400 daltons larger than the active pheromone. In both cases, pheromone activity could be regenerated by treatment with phosphodiesterase II.
TI  - Transferable beta-lactamase. A new mechanism for in vitro penicillin resistance in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Although enterococci are relatively resistant to penicillin, the mechanism of resistance is largely unknown and enzymatic inactivation does not play a role. In this study, an isolate of Streptococcus faecalis was found to have beta lactamase activity resulting in complete inactivation of penicillin. With a high inoculum, this strain was resistant to greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml of penicillin. Penicillin resistance and beta lactamase activity were transferred by conjugation at a high frequency to an enterococcal laboratory recipient strain together with two plasmids of molecular size 34 X 10(6) and 56 X 10(6), thus demonstrating the emergence of plasmid-mediated penicillin resistance in the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid gene encoding the 3'5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type III.
AB  - We have cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced a 1489-bp DNA fragment conferring resistance to kanamycin and originating from the streptococcal plasmid pJH1. The resistance gene was located by analysis of the initiation and termination codons in an open reading frame (ORF) of 792 bp. The deduced gene product, a 3'5''-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of type III, has an Mr of 29,200. Comparison of its amino acid sequence with those of type I (Oka et al., 1981) and type II (Beck et al., 1982) 3' phosphotransferase, from transposable elements Tn903 and Tn5, respectively, indicated a statistically significant structural relationship between these enzymes from phylogenetically remote bacterial genera. The degree of homology observed indicate that phosphotransferase type III and type I genes have diverged from a common ancestor and that the phosphotransferase type II gene has emerged more recently from the type I evolutionary pathway.
TI  - Genetic, molecular, and functional analysis of Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis JH1 contains two conjugative plasmids, pJH1, an R plasmid  that codes for resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, and pJH2, a hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid. Strain JH1 was used as an antibiotic resistance donor in conjugation experiments with two plasmid-free S. faecalis recipient strains, JH2-2 and OG1-RF1. Plasmid pJH1 was purified from one transconjugant, DL77, and subjected to restriction endonuclease analyses. Five restriction enzymes, EcoRI, XbaI, BamHI, SalI, and XhoI, yielding 10, 9, 3, 2, and 2 fragments, respectively, were used to determine the size (80.7 kilobases) of pJH1 and to construct a restriction endonuclease map of the plasmid. Twenty-eight percent of the antibiotic-resistant transconjugants examined expressed only part of the resistance pattern (Kmr Smr Emr Tcr) associated with pJH1, that is, they were resistant to kanamycin, streptomycin, and erythromycin; to erythromycin and tetracycline; or to erythromycin or to tetracycline only. Most of these strains also produced hemolysin and bacteriocin, and several contained a hybrid plasmid consisting of pJH2 and specific segments of pJH1 DNA. Several of these hybrid plasmids, as well as a deletion derivative of pJH1 that coded for resistance to tetracycline but not to kanamycin, streptomycin, or erythromycin, were purified and used to confirm the arrangement of restriction endonuclease fragments on the pJH1 map and to locate the resistance determinants on this map.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from the bloodstream and gingival crevice of man.
AB  - One hundred and twenty six strains of streptococci isolated from the bloodstreams of 123 hospital in-patients--55 with endocarditis--and 255 strains isolated from the gingival crevices of 66 volunteers were characterised. Species isolated were Streptococcus mitior, S. sanguis, undifferentiated viridans streptococci, S. salivarius, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. faecalis. There was no significant difference between the distribution of species in blood and in the gingival crevice. S. mitior and S. sanguis were found less frequently in blood than their presence in the gingival crevice would have suggested, whereas S. milleri was found more frequently. This may indicate that S. milleri is more invasive or that it enters the bloodstream from sources other than the gingival crevice.
TI  - Folate analogues. 22. Synthesis and biological evaluation of two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system.
AB  - Two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system have been synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activities. These compounds, N-[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl)benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (3) and N-[[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl) methyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (4), were synthesized by reacting the appropriately substituted alpha-halo ketones with 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (2). Elaboration of p-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde (5) to p-carbomethoxyphenacyl bromide (7) was accomplished by its oxidation with Jones reagent and the successive treatment of the oxidation product with SOCl2, CH2N2, and HBr. Commercially available p-vinylbenzoic acid (11) was converted to its glutamate conjugate 12 and was further converted to the bromo ketone, diethyl N-[p-(1-bromo-2-oxopropyl)benzoyl]-L-glutamate (17), by a series of reactions involving epoxidation, oxirane ring opening with HBr, Jones oxidation, Zn/HOAc reduction, and successive treatment of the reduction product 16 with SOCl2, CH2N2, and HBr. These bromo ketones, 7 and 17, upon reaction with pyrimidine 2, gave the diethyl esters of the target compounds, which were hydrolyzed to 3 and 4 with NaOH. Compound 4 underwent an interesting acid-catalyzed isomerization where the double bond of 4 was shifted from the 5,6-position to the 6,9-position to give the isomer 19. Both compounds 3 and 4 were inactive against Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469) and did not serve as synthetic substrates of L. casei dihydrofolate reductase. Compound 4 showed activity against Streptococcus faecium (ATCC 8043), but 3 was inactive against this organism.
TI  - Identification and partial characterization of a pheromone-induced adhesive surface antigen of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A surface protein antigen that is produced only during the induction of aggregation of Streptococcus faecalis was shown to contribute to and perhaps be primarily responsible for aggregation. The antigen is an immunodominant surface component of induced cells. F(ab) fragments of immunoglobulins specific for this antigen prevented aggregation, providing direct evidence that the antigen is an adhesin. Consistent with this proposed association was the coincident timing of appearance of the antigen and the timing of aggregation after induction.
TI  - In vitro activity of HR 810, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - HR 810, 3-[(2,3-cyclopenteno-1-pyridinium)methyl]-7-[2-syn-methoximino-2-(2-aminothiazole -4-yl)-acetamido] ceph-3-em-4-carboxylate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative. The in vitro activity of HR 810 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin and gentamicin using 368 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. HR 810 was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, being the most active of the cephalosporins against Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp.; the MICs ranged from much less than 0.06 to 8 mg/l. The activity of HR 810 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. was almost as good as that of ceftazidime. The new compound was superior to the other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus and inhibited all Streptococcus faecalis strains at a concentration of 16 mg/l.
TI  - Streptococcus plasmid pAM alpha 1 is a composite of two separable replicons, one  of which is closely related to Bacillus plasmid pBC16.
AB  - A tetracycline resistance plasmid of Streptococcus faecalis, pAM alpha 1, is shown to contain two independent sets of replication functions, separated from each other on either side by short (300- to 400-base-pair) sequences of homology. The homologous sequences are oriented as direct repeats and therefore permit the dissociation of pAM alpha 1 into its component replicons, referred to here as pAM alpha 1 delta 1 and pAM alpha 1 delta 2, as the reciprocal products of a simple intramolecular recombination. pAM alpha 1 delta 1 is a 4.6-kilobase plasmid which carries the tet gene, and pAM alpha 1 delta 2 is a 5.1-kilobase plasmid which carries no known selectable marker. pAM alpha 1 delta 1 is shown to replicate efficiently in Bacillus subtilis and to confer tetracycline resistance on Bacillus hosts. We demonstrate by restriction mapping analysis that pAM alpha 1 delta 1 is virtually identical to a 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid of Bacillus cereus, pBC16, which is known to show extensive homology to plasmid isolates from Staphylococcus species (such as pUB110), as well as from other Bacillus species. The pAM alpha 1 delta 1-pBC16-pUB110 replicon thus exists naturally in at least three different gram-positive genera, indicating that these plasmids have a high degree of interspecific functional adaptability and supporting the view that plasmid DNA is commonly exchanged among many species of gram-positive bacteria in their natural environments.
TI  - Therapeutic potential of rifampin in enterococcal infections.
AB  - Rifampin is active against enterococci in vitro; virtually all clinical isolates  are inhibited by concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. However, rifampin is bacteriostatic, not bactericidal, and resistance emerges rapidly when the drug is employed alone against enterococci in vitro. The combination of rifampin with beta-lactam drugs, aminoglycosides, or vancomycin generally gives indifferent results. Limited data from studies done in vivo are contradictory and do not document unequivocally that rifampin is strikingly active, even in combination with other agents, against enterococcal infections. Whether rifampin will ever play a role in therapy for enterococcal infections in humans remains to be determined.
TI  - The killing effects of cefathiamidine or ampicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin against enterococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefathiamidine against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. faecium were studied in comparison with other beta-lactams. All the 56 strains of Str. faecalis tested were inhibited by 2 mg/l of cefathiamidine. MICs of ampicillin were twofold higher than those of cefathiamidine and MICs of cephaloridine and cephazolin were 8-16-fold higher. No significant inoculum effect on MICs of cefathiamidine could be seen. Two isolates of Str. faecium showed resistance to the four antibiotics. The MBCs of cefathiamidine and ampicillin for ten strains of Str. faecalis showed that the ratios of MBC/MIC were greater than 64. The rates of killing of Str. faecalis were reduced at concentrations of cefathiamidine and ampicillin greater than the MIC. The most rapid killing was obtained at 2 mg/l cefathiamidine or 4 mg/l of ampicillin. With the addition of 1 mg/l gentamicin this paradoxical bacteriocidal effect was eliminated. Time killing studies showed 99.9% of the cells were killed within 6 h by a combination of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam. The paradoxical bacteriocidal effect of cefathiamidine and ampicillin was also demonstrated on solid media.
TI  - Removal of bacteria from water by adhesion to cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide).
AB  - Cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) was found to have a novel and remarkable ability to remove bacteria from water. For example, when 10 g (wet weight) of cross-linked poly(N-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) was contacted with 20 ml of suspensions of Escherichia coli (9.7 X 10(4) to 9.7 X 10(7)/ml), Salmonella typhimurium (8.0 X 10(6) to 1.1 X 10(7)/ml), Streptococcus faecalis (5.0 X 10(7)/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (8.1 X 10(7)/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2 X 10(5)/ml) under stirring in sterilized physiological saline at 37 degrees C, 99% of the viable cells of these bacteria were removed in 2 to 6 h. When suspensions of these bacteria (10(5) to 10(8) cells per ml) were passed through a column (20 mm by 100 cm) of cross-linked poly(N-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) at 37 degrees C with a flow rate of 0.8 to 1.4 bed volumes per h, 97 to 100% of the viable cells were eliminated from the suspensions during the treatment. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) irreversibly captured these bacteria alive during the treatment. That is, total organic carbon was removed during the treatment, and the bacteria which adhered to the resin proliferated on the bacterial medium. The adhesion capacity was estimated to be 10(10) cells per g (dry weight). Total organic carbon was also removed even when the bacteria were killed by heat treatment before the column studies.
TI  - Rat arthritis due to whole group B streptococci. Clinical and histopathologic features compared with groups A and D.
AB  - Heat-killed streptococci of Groups A, B, and D injected intraperitoneally into Sprague-Dawley rats induced arthritis. The histopathologic features of the arthritis were those of erosive synovitis. Early acute lesions were associated with deposits of streptococcal antigens. The serogroups and the physical state of the streptococci determined the incidence, the time of onset, the duration, and the severity of the disease, the severity being a blend of degree of inflammation, tendency to relapse, and occurrence of ankylosis. Whole Group A usually failed to induce arthritis. Group A disrupted with sonication regularly induced arthritis after a 24-hour latent period. The disease lasted over 60 days and caused ankylosis. Whole Group B regularly induced arthritis but only after a latent period of 6-8 days. The disease lasted over 40 days and caused ankylosed joints. With sonicated Group B a similar disease was induced, except that, as with sonicated Group A, the latent period was 24 hours. Whole Group D induced disease after a latent period of 48 hours. The arthritis lasted only 2 weeks and was transient. In contrast to its effects on Group A and B cocci, sonication of Group D abrogated its capacity to induce arthritis. It is postulated that for whole streptococci, in contrast to sonicated streptococci, arthritogenicity depends on the sensitivity of the cocci to initial processing in vivo. Processing may be partial digestion by enzymes of phagocytes. Cocci such as those of Group A that are insensitive to processing, injected whole, tend not to cause arthritis, but when they do cause disease, it is chronic. A coccus, such as one of Group D, that is very sensitive to processing produces a transient arthritis after a short latent period, while a coccus of intermediate sensitivity, such as one of Group B, induces disease only after a substantial latent period, and the disease is severe and chronic. The nature of processing remains to be determined.
TI  - Purification of a putative K+-ATPase from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We have purified a novel membrane ATPase from Streptococcus faecalis by the following procedure: extraction of membranes with Triton X-100 followed by fractionation of the extract by successive DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and Cm-Sepharose chromatography. The overall yield was 5%. The purified ATPase appears to consist of a single polypeptide component of Mr = 78,000. The Triton-solubilized purified enzyme has a specific activity of approximately 50 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg, is dependent on phospholipids for activity, and is strongly inhibited by vanadate (I50 = 3 microM). Maximal ATPase activity is displayed at pH 7.3. Mg2+-ATP, for which the enzyme has a Km of 60 microM, is the best substrate. The ATPase forms an acylphosphate intermediate that can also be detected in native membranes as the major acylphosphate component. The purified ATPase, when reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles, exhibits coupling, e.g. the ATPase activity can be stimulated at least 8-fold by valinomycin in the presence of potassium. Based on these observations we conclude that the enzyme we have purified is an ion-motive ATPase, most likely a K+-ATPase.
TI  - [Identification and sensitivity of Streptococci to antibiotics].
AB  - In the first part of this research, the author accentuates the quick and easy identification of the Streptococcus by means of Latex-test, testing at the same time the bacitracin. In the second part, the antibiotic sensitivity is tested on 354 strains of Streptococci.
TI  - [Further studies on the effect of fluorides on the lactic acid production of bacteria].
AB  
TI  - Rapid identification of group D streptococci with the API 20S system.
AB  - The API 20S system (Analytab Products) was evaluated as a means of identifying 209 isolates of Lancefield group D streptococci to the species level. Results were compared with those from a conventional tube biochemical identification system and from serological grouping. Use of the latest 20S computerized data base allowed species identification of 97% (203 of 209) of test isolates after a 4-h incubation period and 99% (208 of 209) of test isolates if supplemental overnight biochemical tests were used to clarify the identity of five Streptococcus bovis-variant isolates. The API 20S system appears to be a convenient and accurate method for rapid, same-day species identification of group D streptococci.
TI  - Inhibition of aging changes by lyophilized Streptococcus faecalis in diet.
AB  - Effects of dietary Streptococcus faecalis (SF) on aging were evaluated using 1-week, 6-month, and 27-month-old Wistar and SHR rats. SF was lyophilized and added to commercial pellets at 1%. SF inhibited hypertension in aging SHR. SF inhibited aging-related changes in a wide variety of tissues. These changes were a disarray of hepatic cords, portal fibrosis; calcification of cartilage matrix, dominance of chondroitin sulfate B, and keratosulfate over chondroitin sulfates A and C; aortic endothelial damage, segmental thickening, calcification, and chondroid cells in the intima; atrophy of epidermis and appendages, and increase in amorphous dermal matrix; waxy degeneration and atrophy of psoas muscles; increase in lipoperoxides in the serum, liver, and brain; and reduction of cyclic AMP and GMP in the serum. Histological changes of the xyphoid cartilage, aorta, mesenteric artery, liver, dorsal skin, and psoas muscles in 27-month-old SF rats were much less severe than those in controls.
TI  - Streptococcal R plasmid pIP501: endonuclease site map, resistance determinant location, and construction of novel derivatives.
AB  - The streptococcal resistance plasmid pIP501 (30 kilobase pairs [kb]) encodes resistance to chloramphenicol (Cmr) and erythromycin (Emr) and is capable of conjugative transfer among numerous streptococcal species. By using a streptococcal host-vector recombinant DNA system, the Cmr and Emr determinants of pIP501 were localized to 6.3-kb HindIII and 2.1-kb HindIII-AvaI fragments, respectively. pIP501 was lost at a frequency of 22% in Streptococcus sanguis cells grown at 42 degrees C but was stable in cells grown at 37 degrees C (less than 1% frequency of loss). Sequences from a cryptic multicopy plasmid, pVA380-1, were substituted for the pIP501 Emr determinant in vitro, and the resulting recombinant plasmid, designated pVA797, was recovered in transformed S. sanguis cells. The replication of pVA797 was governed by the pVA380-1 sequences based on temperature-stable replication and incompatibility with pVA380-1-derived replicons. The self-ligation of partially cleaved HindIII pIP501 DNA fragments allowed the localization of a pIP501 region involved in autonomous plasmid replication. A small pIP501 derivative (pVA798) obtained from this experiment had a greatly increased copy number but was unstably inherited. Our data indicate that the sequences encoding the resistance determinants and some of the plasmid replication machinery are relatively clustered on the pIP501 molecule. The properties of pVA797 and pVA798 indicate that these molecules will enhance current streptococcal genetic systems from the standpoint of conjugative mobilization (pVA797) and gene amplification (pVA798).
TI  - Broad geographical distribution of a cytotoxin gene mediating beta-hemolysis and  bacteriocin activity among Streptococcus faecalis strains.
AB  - Conjugative hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids were isolated from Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes strains of diverse geographical origins. Cloned DNA fragments containing the hemolysin-bacteriocin gene(s) from one of these plasmids (pAD1) hybridized to two EcoRI fragments of identical size from each of the five plasmids examined. Results of hybridization experiments in which total plasmid DNA was used suggested that the plasmids shared extensive homology. Two of the plasmids, pAD1 from strain DS16 (Ann Arbor, Mich.) and pAM gamma 1 from strain DS5 (Miami, Fla.), were 100% homologous and had identical EcoRI restriction patterns (eight fragments each). There was no detectable homology between the plasmid-mediated hemolysin determinants of S. faecalis and DNA from other beta-hemolytic streptococci (Lancefield groups A, B, F, or H).
TI  - [Primary structure of the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding subunit of Streptococcus faecalis H+-ATPase].
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)-binding subunit of proton adenosine triphosphatase from glycolysing bacteria Streptococcus faecalis was established. Isolation of the protein from subbacterial particles was carried out by using extraction with a chloroform/methanol mixture and following gel-filtration on Sephadex LH-60 and Bio-gel P-30. To establish the primary structure, use was made of cyanogen bromide and hydroxylamine cleavages, trypsin and partial acid hydrolyses. Separation of the peptide fragments obtained from cyanogen bromide and hydroxylamine cleavages and partial acid hydrolysis was performed by gel-filtration on Bio-gel P-10 and reversed-phase HPLC. Peptide structures were determined mainly with the aid of 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate. The polypeptide chain of the protein consists of 71 amino acid residues (mol. wt. 7291). The primary structure of the protein from S. faecalis shares all common features of the structural organization of other H+-ATPase DCC-binding subunits and shows a high degree of homology with the corresponding subunit of thermophilic bacterium PS-3. Inactivation of H+-ATPase with DCC was due to modification of Glu54 of the polypeptide chain.
TI  - Single-strain regression analysis for determination of interpretive breakpoints for cefoperazone disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - A novel approach for setting interpretive breakpoints in disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing according to determined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) limits is described, using the method of single-strain regression analysis. The procedure was tested on reference strains Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), using published results from cefoperazone disk diffusion experiments. The correlation between logarithm of the disk content and inhibition zone diameter squared was linear, excluding three endpoint values. When constants A and B in the new regression line equation were calculated for the four strains, all four showed different regression lines. Zone diameters corresponding to various MICs were calculated for a disk content of 75 micrograms. The values obtained for the four strains were 20.1, 20.9, 24.9, and 25.8 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 16 micrograms/ml, and 15.7, 15.7, 22.3, and 17.9 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The following zone diameter breakpoints were determined for the "I" (intermediate) category, using a 75-micrograms disk: S. aureus, 18 to 15 mm; S. faecalis, 23 to 13 mm; E. coli, 20 to 17 mm; and P. aeruginosa, 20 to 17 mm.
TI  - Aminoglycoside accumulation by membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Transport of nine aminoglycosides was studied in right side out as well as inside out membrane vesicles derived from aerobically or anaerobically grown E. coli and S. faecalis. Right side out membrane vesicles prepared from aerobically grown E. coli and inside out membrane vesicles prepared from aerobically grown S. faecalis as well as inside out vesicles prepared from anaerobically grown E. coli took up all the aminoglycosides tested whereas right side out vesicles prepared from anaerobically grown E. coli did not exhibit an aminoglycoside transport. Addition of DCCD to vesicles having accumulated aminoglycosides caused an efflux of the substrates from the vesicles. Monitoring of ATP levels in E. coli transporting aminoglycosides revealed that ATP synthesis and aminoglycoside transport were closely interrelated. Based on these data it seems likely that aminoglycoside transport may be closely linked to the direction of proton fluxes catalysed by the ATP'ase.
TI  - Experimental urinary tract infection in rabbits by a group D Streptococcus sp.: a study of serum immunoglobulin classes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - After induction of pyelonephritis and cystitis in rabbits by a group D streptococcus, the authors measured the specific serum antibody response in the three major immunoglobulin classes. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed using group D streptococcal antigen extracted by phenol. Before experimentation, all rabbits had low IgM, IgG and IgA titres against group D streptococcal antigen. A marked increase in IgM antibodies was detected during the first month of experimental pyelonephritis. A poor IgM antibody response was observed in rabbits with cystitis. During the three months of experimentation, a significant difference in mean IgG levels was observed between rabbits with pyelonephritis and those with cystitis.
TI  - Taxonomic studies on some group D streptococci.
AB  - Biochemical, menaquinone, fatty acid and DNA analyses were conducted on a number  of streptococci of serological group D. The results indicate that S. faecalis, S. faeclum, S. casseliflavus and taxa previously designated 'S. avium', 'S. durans' and "S. faecalis var. malodoratus' are distinct species. Strains previously labelled 'S. faecium var. mobilis' were shown to be identical with S. casseliflavus. The results also indicate that some group D streptococci recently isolated from chickens constitute a new species.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R on intestinal flora of weanling piglets and calves.
AB  - The effect of oral administration of Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R, an antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacterium, on the intestinal flora of weanling piglets and cows reared on antibiotic-containing diet was investigated. Fourteen days after administration of the bacteria, the intestinal flora of the piglets was examined. Animals of the administered group had stabilized lactic flora such as bifidobacteria, streptococci, and lactobacilli, whereas most animals of control group had reduced lactic flora. On the other hand, abundant yeasts were detected from the cecum, colon, and feces of the control animals, but the levels were significantly lower in the animals given strain BIO-4R. The density of Salmonella in the intestine appeared to be reduced after the administration of strain BIO-4R. The number of BIO-4R cells was shown to be 10 times lower in the duodenum and jejunum than in the ileum, suggesting that strain BIO-4R might have grown transiently in the ileum. The similar trend toward stabilization of the lactic flora was also observed in cows after administration of BIO-4R. In addition, an antagonistic effect of the strain against yeasts and Salmonella was suggested. These findings indicate that the oral administration of strain BIO-4R is one of the useful methods whereby the potentially deleterious effect of antibiotics on the intestinal flora of farm animals may be minimized.
TI  - Increase in immunoglobulin M antibodies against gut bacteria during acute hepatitis A.
AB  - The marked increase in the total serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) is a characteristic feature of acute hepatitis A. To study the nature of this IgM, we assayed serial titers of IgM antibodies against various antigens during and after acute hepatitis A. The antibodies against blood group antigen remained unchanged throughout the observation period. Thus, the production or metabolism of IgM was not nonspecifically altered. The IgM antibody against hepatitis A antigen decreased and finally disappeared during convalescence as expected. However, its time course did not correlate quantitatively with the concentration of the total serum IgM. In contrast, IgM antibodies against gut bacteria Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus faecalis were considerably elevated in all patients at the onset of the disease, and they normalized similarly to the total IgM during convalescence. IgM antibodies against Escherichia coli were elevated only in some of the patients. The data suggest that the amount of IgM antibodies against gut bacteria contributes significantly to the increase in the total serum IgM in acute hepatitis A.
TI  - Tyrosine decarboxylase. Spectrophotometric assay and application in determining pyridoxal-5'-phosphate.
AB  - We have developed a highly sensitive and rapid spectrophotometric assay for tyrosine decarboxylase that can be applied to determining pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. In the assay, tyramine, a product of tyrosine decarboxylation, reacts with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to give a product soluble in toluene whereas tyrosine does not. We determined the amount of tyramine produced enzymatically by reading the absorbance at 340 nm of a toluene extract of the reaction mixture. This method is capable of detecting as low as 2.9 micrograms/mL of the enzyme. Using this method, we find the Km for tyrosine decarboxylase from Streptococcus faecalis to be 3.55 X 10(-4)M. We have also developed a specific and extremely sensitive method for determining pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, a cofactor of the enzyme, by using this spectrophotometric assay with apotyrosine decarboxylase.
TI  - [A sensitive method for determining the proteolytic activity in culture filtrates].
AB  - A new method for the quantitative determination of low proteinase activities in culture filtrates or other complex protein-containing substrates has been developed. The method is based on the inactivation of streptokinase which is monitored by following the reduction of fibrinolysis. In a time interval ranging from 1 to 500 min, the half-life of streptokinase activity is directly proportional to proteinase concentration. The enzymatic reactions are not interfered with by either other proteins or coloured substances.
TI  - Plasmid content of Streptococcus faecalis strain 39-5 and identification of a pheromone (cPD1)-induced surface antigen.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis 39-5 is a haemolytic, bacteriocinogenic strain harbouring  six plasmids. One of these plasmids, pPD1 (36.4 MDal) determines a bacteriocin and encodes a conjugative response to the sex pheromone cPD1 excreted by recipient (plasmid-free) strains. The pheromone response is characterized by the formation of mating aggregates of donors (responders) with recipients. Aggregation required the presence of phosphate and divalent cations and was inhibited by agents or conditions that destroy protein structure. Aggregation was postulated to be due to synthesis of a new proteinaceous molecule on the donor cell surface. Referred to as 'aggregation substance', such a material was identified and found to exhibit antigenic properties not associated with uninduced cells; it could be detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Aggregation substance could be extracted from induced cells but not uninduced cells as demonstrated by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Antibody raised against the aggregation substance controlled by pPD1 cross-reacted with aggregation substance determined by other plasmid systems which respond to pheromones unrelated to cPD1.
TI  - Simple additives to increase the activity of chlorhexidine digluconate against urinary pathogens.
AB  - The concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill Gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. Increased bactericidal activity was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (EDTA) and a buffer (Tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against Escherichia coli NCTC 86, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7650 Proteus mirabilis NCTC 8309 and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 8213. The type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per cent killing. The 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added EDTA and Tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. The potential of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.
TI  - High-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  - Nine clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis from a university hospital were  found to be resistant to high levels (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. The high-level resistance to these aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillin-aminoglycoside synergism were transferable by conjugation to a susceptible recipient strain. In three strains tested, the aminoglycoside resistance was mediated by four aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes: a 3'-phosphotransferase transferred from two strains, a 2"-phosphotransferase and a 6'-acetyltransferase transferred from all three strains, and a streptomycin adenylyltransferase transferred from two strains. This is the first report of the occurrence of high-level gentamicin resistance in enterococcal isolates from the United States.
TI  - Genetic transposition and insertional mutagenesis in Bacillus subtilis with Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917.
AB  - The Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 was introduced into Bacillus subtilis by transformation of competent cells with the plasmid pAM alpha 1::Tn917 and was tested for transposition activity by selection for insertions into the temperate phage SP beta. Insertions were obtained at a frequency indicating relatively efficient movement of the element, and Southern hybridization analysis of a particular insertion confirmed it to be the result of a genuine transposition event. A restriction fragment from pAM alpha 1::Tn917 containing the transposon sequences was ligated into a temperature-sensitive plasmid (pBD95), and transpositions into the B. subtilis chromosome were selected by requiring the transposon drug resistance to be maintained at temperatures nonpermissive for plasmid replication. Insertions have been recovered at many chromosomal sites, including ones that produced auxotrophy of different kinds and ones that produced various different sporulation-defective phenotypes, indicating good prospects for the use of Tn917 as a tool for insertional mutagenesis in B. subtilis.
TI  - Studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group D streptococci.
AB  - Six penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group D streptococci: Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis and S. faecium. When examined in whole organisms, the PBPs of S. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group D streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of S. faecalis (intermediate penicillin resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of S. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). On the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one PBP or group of PBPs, and the penicillin MIC value for the corresponding micro-organism. Examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to PBPs of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of S. faecalis and S. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these species. The lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group D streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size PBPs of these bacteria.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - [Characterization of the antigen in circulating immune complexes and application  to the detection of streptococcal antigens in human infectious endocarditis].
AB  - Immune complexes from patients with subacute endocarditis were used to develop a  methodology for characterization of the antigen involved in human circulating immune complexes. This model was chosen because it permits isolation of the causative agent of the streptococcal infection thought to contain the antigen present in the immune complex. A comparison was made between two methods for characterization of bacterial antigen bound to antibody. In the first, animals were immunized with purified immune complexes and the production of antistreptococcal antibodies was investigated. In the second method, a sandwich ELISA was developed, implying the double specificity of the immune complex (human immunoglobulin and streptococcal antigen). The latter method gave the best results, detecting antigen in the immune complexes of 8 out of 10 patients' sera. The application of this method to other immunopathological situations is discussed.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of commercial latex agglutination and coagglutination reagents for groups B, C, and D mastitis streptococci.
AB  - A total of 144 strains of mastitis streptococci (groups B, C, and D) were grouped by conventional technique (Lancefield precipitin test) latex agglutination (LA), and coagglutination (CA). The LA correctly grouped 98% and the CA grouped 100% of strains on the test when the instructions of the manufacturers were followed. Sensitivity of both tests was improved for strains belonging to group D when extracts from colonies grown on sheep blood agar plates were used for grouping. Nonspecific reactions between groups C and B were observed only with one kit of LA reagents, whereas cross-reactions were recorded with all groups when CA reagents were used.
TI  - Synergistic effect of N-formimidoyl thienamycin with gentamicin and amikacin against Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in vitro activities of N-formimidoyl thienamycin alone and in combination with amikacin and gentamicin were tested against 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis. Synergy was demonstrated in 35% of the combinations tested by the microtiter checkerboard technique; 50% were found to be synergistic with time killing curves.
TI  - Effect of cadmium and zinc on microbial adherence.
AB  - A study has been made of the effect of cadmium chloride and zinc acetate on the adherence of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans to buccal cells from man. Cadmium led to a significant decrease in the adherence of the three microorganisms tested. Zinc increased the adherence of S. faecalis and E. coli. These alterations in adherence were suppressed by chelating agents. S. faecalis grown in the presence of zinc or cadmium exhibited a decrease in adhesiveness. Pre-incubation of organisms with zinc interfered with the inhibitory effect of cadmium.
TI  - 'Breakthrough' enterococcal septicemia in surgical patients. 19 cases and a review of the literature.
AB  - We studied 19 surgical patients with 24 postoperative episodes of enterococcal septicemia not arising from the biliary or urinary tracts or from infected heart valves. Fifteen episodes occurred despite the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; in only one patient were these drugs effective against enterococcus. There were 14 episodes of enterococcemia in 11 patients following which the patient survived for at least one week. Thirteen (93%) of those episodes were treated with either ampicillin or drainage, or both. Five of the six long-term survivors received ampicillin therapy. Overall mortality was 68%. The data suggest that the enterococcus may emerge as a blood-borne pathogen in immunodepressed, postoperative patients receiving antibiotics for other infections of enteric origin. Antibiotic therapy specifically directed against this organism (and surgical drainage, if necessary) may be indicated during polymicrobial sepsis of enteric or mixed origin. If the spectrum of antibiotics does not include enterococcus, this organism can cause "breakthrough" sepsis, as can many other opportunistic organisms.

TI  - [Stimulation of the natural self-purification of soil].
AB  - Connected with the elaboration of the sanitary norm of cadmium in soil were performed examinations to appoint the self-purification index. This index is the highest permissible concentration of a noxious chemical substance in soil not yet injuring irreversible the process of natural self-purification. As criterions of the self-purification were selected normal and potential respiration, quantity of bacteria, actinomyceta, fungi, proteolytic, nitrifying, and cellulolytic micro-organisms, inhibition of Bacillus subtilis and Phormidium autumnale, survival and increasing ability of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Salmonella give. Among the influence of various concentrations of cadmium was find out the self-purification index of 500 mg Cd++/kg. By experience are offered methodical improvements at the elaboration of self-purification indices.
TI  - Isolation of a DNA sequence related to several plasmids from Bacillus thuringiensis after a mating involving the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1.
AB  - The transmissible plasmid pAM beta 1, which codes for resistance to erythromycin  and lincomycin, was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to several strains of Bacillus thuringiensis by a filter-mating process. Introduction of pAM beta 1 into the Emr transconjugant strains of B. thuringiensis was confirmed by Southern hybridisation using the 32P-labelled pAM beta 1 as a probe. In the B. thuringiensis transconjugant strains, used as donors, the beta plasmid conserved its ability to be transferred during intraspecific mating, with a frequency of 10(-4) per recipient cell. In addition, the transconjugant clones acted as donors of the erythromycin resistance marker and permitted the transfer of cryptic plasmids present in the B. thuringiensis (beta) strains used as donors. From a transconjugant clone of B. thuringiensis a hybrid plasmid resulting from an in vivo insertion into pAM beta 1 of a 3 Md DNA sequence was isolated. This 3 Md DNA molecule originated from a 54 Md plasmid of a kurstaki strain and is related to several plasmids found in different serotypes of B. thuringiensis.

TI  - Folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetases: properties and regulation.
AB  - The substrate specificities of folylpolyglutamate synthetases from Corynebacterium species, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are described. The purified Corynebacterium enzyme catalyzes the addition of glutamate moieties to reduced pteroylmonoglutamates, and to 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyldi- and triglutamates. The purified protein also possesses a separate dihydrofolate synthetase activity. Binding of pteroate substrates to dihydrofolate synthetase impairs folate binding to folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria and mammalian cells, which differs from source to source, appears to be a reflection of the ability of folylpolyglutamates to act as substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases from different sources. Bacterial synthetases use a variety of pteroylmonoglutamates as their preferred monoglutamate substrate, but use 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl polyglutamates as their preferred, and sometimes only, polyglutamate substrates. Mono- and polyglutamyl forms of tetrahydrofolate are the preferred substrates of the CHO cell synthetase. Products of one carbon metabolism do not affect the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in CHO cells. Although adenine changes the distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria, this effect is mediated by changing the substrate availability for the synthetase reaction, and not by regulating the levels of the synthetase per se.

TI  - [In vitro study of the lipase activity of bacterial strains isolated from the rabbit cecum on C14-labeled triolein].
AB  - The lipase activity of bacterial species isolated from the caecum of conventional rabbits was studied by means of two groups of tests: (1) bacteriologic isolation and an identification of nine aerobic and anaerobic clones and (2) incubation of each of these clones in the appropriate medium in the presence of labelled triolein (oleyl 1-14C), a biochemical analysis of the radioactivity of the fractions obtained. The main results can be expressed in the following way: maximum hydrolysis of glycerides is achieved by two species: Bacillus licheniformis and Clostridium sporogenes. The reaction is proportional to the incubation time for incubations of less than 8 h. The release of fatty acids is concomitant to the synthesis of phospholipids and of fatty acid methyl esters.
TI  - [Numerical classification of enterococci].
AB  - The taxonomic analysis of enterococci by a mathematical method has revealed that  these organisms are subdivided, according to their properties, into three taxons; of these, two taxons correspond to the species known as Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium, while the third taxon, sharply different from the rest, comprises mobile enterococci which can be probably regarded as a separate species and differentiated from the other two species by a number of characteristics.
TI  - Endophthalmitis following penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - To determine the incidence of infectious endophthalmitis in the early postoperative period following penetrating keratoplasty, and the type and origin of the causative organisms, all cases of penetrating keratoplasty performed at the Emory University affiliated hospitals between January 1977 and March 1982 were reviewed. Four (0.2%) of the 1,876 cases developed infectious endophthalmitis. In all four, evidence of infection developed within 72 hours, and in three the donor rim culture grew the same organism as was obtained from the anterior chamber or vitreous. The causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group D Streptococcus-enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eyes with positive donor rim cultures had a 22-fold increased incidence of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme content of a multiply resistant strain of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strain BM6217 was resistant to high levels of all the clinically useful aminoglycoside antibiotics. This broad aminoglycoside resistance was mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase, acetyltransferase, and adenylyltransferase activities. It was inferred that phosphorylation occurred at the 3', 5", and 2"-hydroxyl groups, acetylation at the 6'-amino group, and adenylylation, probably, at the 6-hydroxyl group of the aminoglycosides. Strain BM6217 remained susceptible to the aminocyclitol spectinomycin but the combination of penicillin G with that antibiotic appeared antagonistic to this strain.

TI  - Enhancement by Candida albicans of Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus faecalis in the establishment of infection in mice.
AB  - Candida albicans has been shown to stimulate infection in mice by a number of bacteria. Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with as little as 500 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus along with a nonlethal dose of 10(8) colony-forming units of C. albicans (one-third the dose causing 50% mortality in 7 days) developed widespread staphylococcal infection. S. aureus injected alone at that or considerably higher doses did not establish infection. Phage typing methods demonstrated that the staphylococcal infection was due to the bacterial organisms originally injected. A minimum dose of C. albicans between 1.1 X 10(5) and 1.1 X 10(7) colony-forming units was necessary for the amplification of virulence of S. aureus to take place. Serratia marcescens and Streptococcus faecalis inoculated intraperitoneally at small nonlethal doses could also be recovered from blood and tissues 5 days after animals were dually injected with C. albicans but not from animals which were inoculated with the same amounts of these bacteria alone.
TI  - Regulation of folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthesis in bacteria: in vivo and in vitro synthesis of pteroylpoly-gamma-glutamates by Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis accumulated labeled folic acid and metabolized this compound to poly-gamma-glutamates of chain lengths of up to 11 and 5, respectively. Octa- and nonaglutamates predominated in L. casei, and tetraglutamates predominated in S. faecalis. The most effective monoglutamate substrates for the L. casei and S. faecalis folylpoly-gamma-glutamate (folylpolyglutamate) synthetases were methylene- and formyltetrahydrofolate, respectively. Methylenetetrahydropteroylpoly-gamma-glutamates were the preferred poly-gamma-glutamate substrates for both enzymes and, in each case, the highest activity was observed with the diglutamate substrate. The final distribution of folylpolyglutamates in these bacteria appeared to reflect the ability of folates with various glutamate chain lengths to act as substrates for the bacterial folylpolyglutamate synthetases. The proportions of individual folylpolyglutamates were markedly affected by culturing the bacteria in medium containing adenine, whereas thymine was without effect. Adenine did not affect the level of folylpolyglutamate synthetase in either organism but caused a large increase in the proportion of intracellular folates containing one-carbon units at the oxidation level of formate, folates which are substrates for enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis. The folates with shorter glutamate chain lengths in bacteria cultured in the presence of adenine resulted from primary regulation of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, regulation which caused an accumulation of formyltetrahydropteroyl-poly-gamma-glutamates (folate derivatives that are ineffective substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases), and did not result from regulation of folylpolyglutamate synthetase per se.
TI  - [Experimental study on synergism between cefotaxime and ampicillin against Streptococcus D group].
AB  - Cefotaxime (CTX) disks and ampicillin (ABPC) disks exhibited synergism against 24 strains of Streptococcus D group isolated from various sources in our hospital. We were interested in these synergism effects and compared them with the combination index. Twenty-two out of the 24 strains examined exhibited synergism, and were identified as Streptococcus faecalis by the API strep system. We divided them into 4 groups (combination index: 19, 15, 11, 9) according to the degree of synergism. Another 2 strains showed additive effects (combination index: 1), and were identified as Streptococcus faecium. Among these 24 strains, beta-lactamases were produced by only 1. There was no direct connection between beta-lactamase production and synergism. The mechanism of synergism between CTX and ABPC has not yet been studied.
TI  - Synergism between N-formimidoyl thienamycin and gentamicin or tobramycin against  enterococci.
AB  - By the time-kill curve method, the combination of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and gentamicin showed synergism against 47 of 48 strains of enterococci, whereas the combination of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and tobramycin was synergistic against 46 strains.
TI  - Mapping of Streptococcus faecalis plasmids pAD1 and pAD2 and studies relating to  transposition of Tn917.
AB  - Plasmids pAD1 (37.8 megadaltons) and pAD2 (17.1 megadaltons) of Streptococcus faecalis strain DS16 have been mapped with restriction enzymes. The location of a hemolysin-bacteriocin determinant on the conjugative pAD1 plasmid was derived from analyses of transposon insertions. Electron microscope and hybridization analyses located Tn917(Em) and the streptomycin (Sm) and kanamycin (Km) resistance determinants on the nonconjugative pAD2 plasmid. It was shown previously that the erythromycin (Em) resistance associated with Tn917 is inducible and that transposition from pAD2 to pAD1 is also stimulated by exposure of cells to low concentrations of Em. Here we show that inducing concentrations of Em also increase the conjugative transfer potential of pAD1; this is possibly related to a mild and short-lived inhibitory stress placed on the cells before full induction of resistance. Selection of Em-resistant transconjugants arising from matings between DS16 and a plasmid-free recipient gave rise to transconjugants which primarily harbor stable pAD1::pAD2 cointegrates. A 30-min exposure of donors to Em (0.5 microgram/ml) before mating resulted in a severalfold increase in the number of such transconjugants. However, a small fraction (e.g., 3 of 40) of these Emr Smr Kmr transconjugants harbored pAD1::Tn917 and pAD2 molecules. Since we believe pAD2 is incapable of being mobilized by pAD1 without being covalently linked, it is likely that transfer in these cases involved cointegrates representing structural intermediates in the transposition of Tn917 from pAD2 to pAD1. It follows that such intermediates probably had two copies of Tn917 and readily resolved after transfer. (These cointegrates are different from the stable cointegrates which were shown to have only a single copy of Tn917; the latter are assumed not to be related to transposition.) Two variants with altered Tn917 transposition properties were derived. One of them transposed at an elevated frequency, whereas the other showed no detectabel transposition. In neither case was transposition influenced by Em exposure; however, both remained inducible for Em resistance.

TI  - Analysis of a single reference strain for determination of gentamicin regression  line constants and inhibition zone diameter breakpoints in quality control of disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing.
AB  - An equation was derived from known formulas to express the size of the inhibition zone diameter in the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test as a function of the disk content of antibiotic. The equation permitted a calculation of regression line constants for the correlation between zone diameter and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with a single reference strain. Analysis of reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, as well as 12 clinical isolates belonging to these species, showed a linearity between zone size squared and the logarithm of disk content in tests with 10-, 30-, and 100-micrograms gentamicin disks. All three species, however, gave regression line constants which were characteristic for the individual bacterial species. Calculations of zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended MIC limits with E. coli and P. aeruginosa reference strains gave an accurate prediction of gentamicin susceptibility. Histogram analysis of 48 strains of Streptococcus faecalis from clinical specimens showed a distribution of zone diameter values which would result in false classification of susceptibility with breakpoints calculated for the other bacterial species studied. Single reference strain analysis of S. faecalis ATCC 29212 (gentamicin MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) permitted the calculation of breakpoints which accurately assigned the strains tested to the intermediate category of susceptibility. Single reference strain analysis offers a quality control method for individual laboratories that allows the determination of inhibition zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended MIC limits with no MIC determinations required.
TI  - Enzymes of agmatine degradation and the control of their synthesis in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 11700 uses agmatine as its sole energy source for growth. Agmatine deiminase and putrescine carbamoyltransferase are coinduced by growth on agmatine. Glucose and arginine were found to exert catabolite repression on the agmatine deiminase pathway. Four mutants unable to utilize agmatine as an energy source, isolated from the wild-type strain, exhibited three distinct phenotypes. Two of these strains showed essentially no agmatine deiminase, one mutant showed negligible activity of putrescine carbamoyltransferase, and one mutant was defective in both activities. Two carbamate kinases are present in S. faecalis, one belonging to the arginine deiminase pathway, the other being induced by growth on agmatine. These two enzymes have the same molecular weight, 82,000, and seem quite different in size from the kinases isolated from other streptococci.
TI  - Enterococci. Biologic and epidemiologic characteristics and in vitro susceptibility.
AB  - Enterococci cause urinary tract infection (usually asymptomatic), 5% to 15% of cases of endocarditis, and rare cases of meningitis. Their role in polymicrobial infection in the abdomen and pelvis is difficult to assess. Ninety percent of enterococci are inhibited by 4 mg/L of penicillin G, by 2 mg/L of ampicillin, and by 6 mg/L of vancomycin. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin are at least fourfold less active against enterococci than penicillin G, whereas piperacillin has activity equivalent to penicillin G. The addition of an aminoglycoside to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin or piperacillin--which are not bactericidal against most strains of enterococci--results in more rapid and complete bacterial activity (ie, synergistic activity).
TI  - Antitumor and interferon-inducing activities of TH69, a whole bacterial preparation of Streptococcus faecalis, in mice.
AB  - The antitumor effect of TH69, a lyophilized whole cell preparation of Streptococcus faecalis, was examined in mice using four experimental tumors: Ehrlich carcinoma and sarcoma-180 in DDI mice, MCA tumor in syngeneic C3H mice and Meth-A tumor in syngeneic BALB/c mice. Consecutive intraperitoneal injections of TH69 started one day after the tumor implantation markedly inhibited the growth of the two allogeneic ascites tumors and two syngeneic solid tumors. However, even with the most sensitive Ehrlich ascites tumor, TH69 was ineffective when the tumor cell inoculum was more than 2 X 10(6) cells per mouse. Neither oral nor subcutaneous administrations of TH69 produced significant antitumor effects. After a single intraperitoneal administration of TH69 (300 mg/kg) to mice, interferon was induced in the serum with a titer of 220 U/ml at 14 hr after administration. As TH69 has no direct cytotoxic activity against Ehrlich tumor cells, the antitumor effect of TH69 in mice must be ascribed to some immunopotentiating activity including interferon induction.
TI  - Membrane-DNA attachment sites in Streptococcus faecalis cells grown at different  rates.
AB  - The M-band technique was used to assess the number of attachment points of DNA to the cell membrane of Streptococcus faecalis grown at three different rates. Cells were X irradiated in liquid nitrogen and then analyzed simultaneously for the introduction of double-strand breaks into the chromosome and the degree of removal of DNA from the cell membrane (M band). Consideration of the data from these experiments and of the topology of the bacterial chromosome resulted in a reevaluation of former quantitative models. Our results are consistent with a semiquantitative model in which the bacterial chromosome is organized around a core structure. We interpret our data to mean that the core is attached to the membrane and that the complexity of the core changes more drastically with growth rate than does the number of membrane-DNA attachment points. An alternative model in which RNA hybridizes with DNA containing single- and double-strand breaks is also discussed. In any event, the complexity of these interactions precludes a reliable estimate of the number of membrane-DNA attachment sites.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of cefmenoxime in pediatric infections].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinical isolated organisms was measured; CMX was more active than cefotiam and cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The serum concentrations of CMX following intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 25.6, 10.3, 3.0 micrograms/ml at 30, 60, 120 minutes after injection, respectively. CMX was excreted 60.9% in urine within 6 hours after injection. CMX was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections (respiratory tract infection 16 including 1 pyothorax, urinary tract infection 4, tonsillitis with sinusitis 2) at the dose of 39 approximately 96 mg/kg/day for 4 approximately 9 days, and the following satisfactory results were obtained; excellent in 11, good in 9, and poor in 2. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 90.9%. Eosinophilia 2 cases, slight elevation of transaminase 3 cases, slight elevation of BUN 1 case and transient diarrhea 1 case were observed. But no other serious side effects were observed.
TI  - In vitro activity of teichomycin A 2 in comparison with penicillin and vancomycin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Teichomycin A2, a glycopeptide antibiotic from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, was  tested for its in vitro activity against 190 gram-positive cocci under variable test conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were fairly insensitive to both changes of inoculum size and pH, but were higher on agar than in broth. Teichomycin was about as active as vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin resistant and sensitive strains), slightly inferior to vancomycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and distinctly more active against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - [Characterization and bioactivity of interferon induced by Streptococcus faecalis preparation, TH69].
AB  - It was demonstrated that TH69, an lyophylized preparation of streptococcus faecalis TH001 (ATCC No. 31663) induced interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in spleen cell cultures. The IFN activity was found in 8 hrs and reached to the peak of 120-240 U/ml 24-48 hrs after incubation in every concentration of 4, 20, and 100 micrograms/ml of TH69. TH69-induced IFN (TH69-IFN) was produced by T cells assisted by macrophages which were stimulated with TH69, and the activity was neutralized by 80-90% with anti-IFN gamma serum but hardly neutralized with anti-IFN alpha, beta serum. Therefore, TH69-IFN was found to be mostly gamma type. The elution profile of TH69-IFN activity on a column with Toyopearl HW-55S showed that molecular weight of IFN was estimated at 18,000-28,000. Sequential purification on this column of TH69-IFN increased the specific activity to approximately 2.5 X 10(4) U/mg protein (partially purified TH69-IFN: TH69-IFNp). A small amount of TH69-IFNp (5-50 U/ml) augmented NK activity and induced cytotoxic macrophages in vitro. Growth of Meth-A tumor cells exposed to TH69-IFNp of 100 U/ml in vitro declined to 50% and three times injection of TH69-IFN (200 U/50 microliters) into the tumor sites of mice given implants of Meth-A suppressed the tumor growth.
TI  - Group and type distribution of beta-haemolytic streptococcus strains in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 1973-1980.
AB  - Group and type differentiation by Griffith' method of agglutination was performed on 7514 haemolytic streptococcal strains isolated from patients with acute streptococcal infections. Thirteen different groups were found--the most frequent were groups A (63.0%), B (12.5%), C (8.1%) and G(2.5%). The group A was predominant among strains isolated from upper respiratory tract, but in later years the frequency of group A strains among streptococci causing respiratory infections was significantly lower. In every year of the study period the most prevalent group A types were T1, T2, T4, T12 and T28--only their relative distribution was changing in the course of time.

The results of the antibody-coated bacteria test (ACB test) were usually negative at the end of follow-up time. Confirming previous results in streptococcus D urinary infection in the child, this experimental model shows that the ACB test is not reliable in urinary infections due to streptococcus D.
TI  - [Higher fatty acid composition of enterococci].
AB  - The content of unsaturated fatty acids in enterococcal cells has been found to have no essential relation to the composition of the culture medium. When cultivated in the same media, S. faecium had the degree of lipid unsaturation 1.5-2 times higher than S. faecalis. Mobile enterococci are sharply differentiated from immobile species by the content of cyclopropanic acid with 19 carbon atoms, constitute a heterogenous group and consist of at least 2 taxons, differing in the content of acids with 18 carbon atoms and the degree of lipid unsaturation.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial activities of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) with those of other recently developed beta-lactam derivatives.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 Acinetobacter spp., 50 Streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was compared with the recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. Among the gram-negative bacteria, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. but had comparable activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter strains. Activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat lower than that of moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. Moreover, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all gram-negative isolates tested. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90% MIC, 0.25 micrograms/ml); however, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90% MIC. The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of R-plasmids from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  - R-plasmids originally isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes(pAC1,pAM15346), Streptococcus agalactiae(pIP501), and Streptococcus faecalis(pAM beta 1) were shown to be self-transferable on filter membranes from S. faecalis JH2-2 to Staphylococcus aureus recipients. The nonconjugative plasmid pAM alpha 1 was mobilized into S. aureus by pAM beta 1. Once in S. aureus, conjugative R-plasmids could be transferred to a second S. aureus recipient or back into S. faecalis. Determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in S. aureus. Agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as self-replicating elements in S. aureus recipients.

TI  - Experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 7. Results of long-term combined therapy of Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis with penicillin and gentamicin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of long-term penicillin-gentamicin treatment on experimental S. faecalis endocarditis due to selected strains; one strain was homogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin (IC50 and MIC greater than 8000 micrograms ml), the other strain heterogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin (IC50: 3300 micrograms/ml, MIC: greater than 8000 micrograms/ml. Both strains showed low-grade resistance to gentamicin (MIC 10.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively). The results showed that there was significant effect of the treatment in rabbits with endocarditis due to both strains, as measured by lowered mortality and by high bacteriologic cure rate. Despite effective antibiotic treatment, a high incidence (57%) of congestive heart failure was noted in rabbits late in the treatment period or after termination of antibiotic treatment, probably due to healing processes on the aortic valves. In human cases of S. faecalis endocarditis the antibiotic treatment should be either penicillin plus streptomycin or penicillin plus gentamicin. However, in cases where the infecting strain is homogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin, the treatment with penicillin plus gentamicin is clearly the drug combination of choice.
TI  - Effects of growth temperature on transport and membrane viscosity in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A shift in the growth temperature of Streptococcus faecalis from 37 to 10 degrees C resulted in an 18% increase in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Electron spin resonance spectra of spin-labeled membranes and extracted phospholipids indicated viscosity changes consistent with the alterations in fatty acid composition. Growth temperature had no significant effect on the active transport of leucine and alanine; uptake rates assayed at 10 or 35 degrees C were essentially the same in cells grown at either 10 or 37 degrees C. The relative rapidity of amino acid transport, which presumably contributes to the ability of S. faecalis to thrive in cold environments, is evidently unrelated to adaptive changes in the viscosity of membrane lipids.
TI  - Identification of bacterial antigens in circulating immune complexes of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The presence of circulating immune complexes (IC) in patients with infective endocarditis has been well documented but the contributions of host and bacterial components to these IC have not been defined. To study this question, IC were isolated from serum of a patient with Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis by differential polyethylene glycol precipitation and competitive binding to staphylococcal protein A. A rabbit antiserum raised against the purified IC had reactivity by crossed immunoelectrophoresis primarily with an antigen derived from the cytoplasm of the infective organism. The antigen was a protein with a 12,000-dalton molecular mass. In situ radiolabeling of the IC bound to the protein A demonstrated a component of the same molecular mass as the bacterial antigen recognized by the antiserum. The patient serum had multiple antibody specificities reactive with bacterial antigens, including the antigen recognized by the rabbit anti-IC antiserum. These techniques for isolation and characterization of circulating IC may have value in the study of IC diseases in which the inciting antigens are not known.
TI  - Genetic and physiological analysis of conjugation in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of conjugal plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis, a genetic analysis of the sex pheromone-dependent tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF-10 was initiated. Rare transconjugants obtained from short matings with wild-type donors not exposed to sex pheromones were screened for increased donor potential in a subsequent mating. From this screening, a mutant plasmid, designated pCF-11, whose transfer functions are expressed in the absence of pheromone induction was isolated. Cells carrying pCF-11 spontaneously clump when grown in broth culture but do not excrete sex pheromones active against wild-type donors. In the course of initial experiments, it was observed that physiological conditions could affect plasmid transfer frequency. Therefore, a set of standardized optimal mating conditions was defined. The experiments carried out to determine these conditions revealed that a transient increase in transfer frequency of about 2 order of magnitude occurred in early-exponential-phase donor cells. This peak of activity is independent of sex pheromone response, since it was observed with induced or uninduced donor cells carrying either pCF-11 or pCF-10.
TI  - A comparison of the levels of faecal indicator bacteria in water and human faeces in a rural area of a tropical developing country (Sierra Leone).
AB  - The levels of faecal coliforms (FC), indole-positive FC (presumptive Escherichia  coli), faecal streptococci (FS), Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens in the natural water sources used by 29 rural settlements in Sierra Leone were investigated. Levels of the same indicators in human faeces were also investigated. The incidence of Salmonella spp. in both habitats and the temperature, pH and conductivity of water sources were also recorded. All water sources were contaminated with the indicator bacteria, mean numbers of which occurred in the relationship FC greater than presumptive E. coli congruent to FS congruent to C. perfringens greater than S. faecalis. FC were also predominant in human faeces, the relationship of means being FC congruent to presumptive E. coli greater than FS greater S. faecalis greater than C. perfringens. The need for confirmation of FC counts obtained from water sources was indicated by the large number of positive tubes produced in the FC multiple-tube dilution test from some samples which could not be confirmed as presumptive E. coli. Salmonella spp. Were isolated from 13 water sources and 6% of faecal samples. Mean water temperature was high (26.2 degrees C), pH low (5.04) and conductivity low (34 microS cm-1). Presumptive E. coli was considered the most appropriate indicator of faecal pollution of the types of water investigated.
TI  - Pathogenicity of enterococci outside of urinary tract and blood stream.
AB  - It is evident at this time that enterococci by themselves are able to cause infections outside the bloodstream and the urinary tract only rarely and under very special circumstances in which local defense mechanisms are severely compromised (e.g., by plastic devices). In most instances, they have been found in mixed culture and probably act synergistically with other bacteria to cause damage to the host. They could, however, be carried from their habitat into the bloodstream and eventually cause septicemia. Such a danger is probably heightened if supercolonization is fostered through antibiotics that are ineffective against them, e.g., cephalosporins.
TI  - Resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics in enterococci from the intestines of animals.
AB  - Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin group B (MLS) resistant strains were found among enterococci isolated from caeca of poultry, pigs and cattle. The percentage of MLS resistance among the poultry strains was 70 per cent. The Streptococcus faecium strains were more susceptible than the other enterococcal strains to virginiamycin, a member of the streptogramin class of antibiotics. This was due to higher susceptibility of the S faecium strains to the virginiamycin component M which belongs to the streptogramin group A antibiotics. Ability to inactivate clindamycin, an antibiotic of the lincosamide class of antibiotics, was noted in an unclassified group D streptococcus strain isolated from a pig.
TI  - The pH of ascitic fluid in the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  alcoholic cirrhosis.
AB  - Fifty-six patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and ascites were studied. The ascitic fluid was analyzed for pH, PO2, PCO2 glucose, protein, specific gravity, amylase, lactic dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, polymorphonuclear count, and cytology. It was also cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Simultaneously, arterial blood was analyzed for pH, PO2, and PCO2. Venous blood was analyzed for complete blood count, protein, aspartate transaminase, and it was also cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Six patients had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), i.e., culture was positive for Escherichia coli in five and Streptococcus faecalis in one. The mean (+/- S.E.) ascitic fluid pH in the SBP group wa 7.25 +/- 0.06 with a range of 7.12 to 7.31, while the ascitic fluid pH in the group with sterile ascites was 7.47 +/- 0.07 with a range of 7.39 to 7.58. The pH of the blood in both groups was 7.47 +/- 0.03. The pH of the ascites in the SBP group was significantly different from the pH in the group with sterile ascites, p less than 0.001. It was also significantly different from the blood pH, p less than 0.001. Highly significant inverse correlations existed between the ascitic pH in the SBP group and the ascitic white blood cell count (r = 0.84, p less than 0.01) and between the ascite pH in the SBP group and the ascitic polymorphonuclear count (r = -0.87 ,p less than 0.01). The ascitic fluid pH is recommended as an easy, quick, sensitive, and specific means of diagnosing SBP and it overcomes the problem of the present SBP diagnostic methods of utilizing an absolute white blood cell count greater than 500 per mm3 or a polymorphonuclear count greater than 250 per mm3 in which false positive interpretations occur.
TI  - Third-generation cephalosporins: comparative antibacterial activity against routine clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of five third-generation cephalosporins (thienamycin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, moxalactam and cefoperazone) was compared with that of three second-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime) against 313 routine clinical isolates. Thienamycin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and moxalactam had superior activity against coliform bacilli compared to cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime. Only three cephalosporins (ceftazidime, thienamycin and cefoperazone) had significant activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both third-and second-generation cephalosporins had similar activity against gram-positive cocci, except for thienamycin, which was the most active cephalosporin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. No single cephalosporin showed overall superiority in antibacterial activity, but thienamycin and ceftazidime were the most active against the range of bacteria tested.
TI  - HPr proteins of different microorganisms studied by hydrogen-1 high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance: similarities of structures and mechanisms.
AB  - The HPr proteins of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were studied by 1H NMR at 360 MHz. The "active-center" histidines of all HPr proteins are characterized by a low pK value between 5.6 and 6.1 and similar spectral parameters. Phosphorylation of the histidyl residues leads to an increase of the pK value of 2-3 units and spectral changes characteristic for N-1 phosphorylation of the histidyl ring. The spectra of the HPr proteins of S. lactis, S. Faecalis, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus reveal many similarities, whereas the spectrum of the E. coli protein is different with exception of the active-center histidine. The HPr protein of S. lactis is formylated at its terminal amino group.
TI  - [Faecal streptococci as indicator organisms of drinking water].
AB  - The rules of the European Economic Community to harmonize the hygienic quality of drinking water write out the faecal streptococci as indicator organisms. This operating definition of the faecal streptococci prohibits its taxonomic limitation to enterococci or group D streptococci. Therefore, we have undertaken studies concerning the methods for routine examinations. Comparative investigations of selective enrichment broths showed no significant differences of the end concentration of glucose in the range of 0.5-1.0% and of sodium azide in the range of 0.02-0.05%. 36 degrees C was a better incubation temperature than 44 degrees C and the results were better after 24 h than after 48 h. Comparative investigations of selective plating media showed less selectivity of the bile-aesculin agar and gentamicinthallous-carbonate agar than that on the one hand of citrate-azide-tween-carbonate agar, KF streptococcal agar or Slanetz-Bartley enterococcal agar, and on the other hand of kanamycin-aesculin-azide agar. All together the kanamycin-aesculin-azide agar seems to be a little better than the other media (Table 2) 356 strains of faecal streptococci were isolated from the studied media. More than 20 characteristics were investigated and, there upon, the strains were differentiated (Table 3). S. faecalis predominates in human materials, i.e. urine, S. faecium and S. durans were isolated specially from sewage and waste water (Table 4). The single species of faecal streptococci grow specificly on the different selective media, and therefore, each agar specimen prefers the one or other species more or less selectively (Table 5).
TI  - The characteristics of peptide uptake in Streptococcus faecalis: studies on the transport of natural peptides and antibacterial phosphonopeptides.
AB  - Transport of natural peptides and antibacterial phosphonopeptide analogues was studied in Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790. Competition studies, and the isolation of peptide-transport deficient mutants, indicate the presence of two peptide permeases. One is a high-rate system used by dipeptides, and to a lesser extent tripeptides; the other is a low-rate oligopeptide system. Following uptake, peptides are cleaved and their amino acid residues may undergo rapid exodus. Different strains of S. faecalis differ in their rates of peptide transport.
TI  - [Nucleotide composition of enterococcal DNA].
AB  - A simple method for isolating DNA from enterococci has been developed. This method allows one to extract DNA of good quality in optimal amounts irrespective of the method used for obtaining the culture and the duration of its incubation. Mobile enterococci are sharply differentiated into 3 groups in accordance with their nucleotide composition, the content of GC pairs in DNA being 31.6% in group 1, 35.8-38.0% in group 2, and 40.6-41.5% in group 3.
TI  - Apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  - Experimental infections in root canals with Streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (Strep-MC4). Actinomyces bovis (Act-MC6) and Bacteroides oralis (Bact-MC3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. The immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. The antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. In 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. After 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and histologically examined. The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. The cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. The radiographic and histologic examinations revealed no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number of teeth with periapical lesions. The radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. Histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. In the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. Mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.
TI  - Microcystis aeruginosa toxin: cell culture toxicity, hemolysis, and mutagenicity  assays.
AB  - Crude toxin was prepared by lyophilization and extraction of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa from four natural sources and a unicellular laboratory culture. The responses of cultures of liver (Mahlavu and PCL/PRF/5), lung (MRC-5), cervix (HeLa), ovary (CHO-K1), and kidney (BGM, MA-104, and Vero) cell lines to these preparations did not differ significantly from one another, indicating that toxicity was not specific for liver cells. The results of a trypan blue staining test showed that the toxin disrupted cell membrane permeability within a few minutes. Human, mouse, rat, sheep, and Muscovy duck erythrocytes were also lysed within a few minutes. Hemolysis was temperature dependent, and the reaction seemed to follow first-order kinetics. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Tetrahymena pyriformis were not significantly affected by the toxin. The toxin yielded negative results in Ames/Salmonella mutagenicity assays. Microtiter cell culture, trypan blue, and hemolysis assays for Microcystis toxin are described. The effect of the toxin on mammalian cell cultures was characterized by extensive disintegration of cells and was distinguishable from the effects of E. coli enterotoxin, toxic chemicals, and pesticides. A possible reason for the acute lethal effect of Microcystis toxin, based on cytolytic activity, is discussed.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associated with acute viral hepatitis.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) occurs most frequently in patients with cirrhosis and preexistent ascites; SBP has not been previously recognized in association with acute liver disease. We report two patients with acute hepatitis B infection who developed SBP. Patient 1 had Streptococcus pneumoniae peritonitis and bacteremia, but did not have ascites until after the peritoneal infection was evident. Subsequent liver biopsy and follow-up studies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of acute hepatitis. Patient 2 had submassive hepatic necrosis due to hepatitis B and developed ascites before Streptococcus fecalis SBP. Although the association of SBP with acute hepatic injury is rare, these two patients illustrate that the syndrome of SBP does occur with acute liver disease.
TI  - Control of enzyme synthesis in the arginine deiminase pathway of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The formation of the arginine deiminase pathway enzymes in Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 11700 was investigated. The addition of arginine to growing cells resulted in the coinduction of arginine diminase (EC 3.5.3.6), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3), and carbamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3). Growth on glucose-arginine or on glucose-fumarate-arginine produced a decrease in the specific activity of the arginine fermentation system. Aeration had a weak repressing effect on the arginine deiminase pathway enzymes in cells growing on arginine as the only added substrate. By contrast, depending on the growth phase, a marked repression of the pathway by oxygen was observed in cells growing on glucose-arginine. We hypothesize that, in S. faecalis, the ATP pool is an important signal in the regulation of the arginine deiminase pathway. Mutants unable to utilize arginine as an energy source, isolated from the wild type, exhibited four distinct phenotypes. In group I the three enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway were present and probably affected in the arginine uptake system. Group II mutants had no detectable arginine deiminase, whereas group III mutants had low levels of ornithine carbamoyltransferase. Group IV mutants were defective for all three enzymes of the pathway.
TI  - Origins of the mycoplasmas: sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas evolved from streptococci.
AB  - We report the establishment of a phylogenetic relationship between the sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas (Acholeplasma species) and streptococci. Three specific antisera prepared against purified Streptococcus faecalis fructose diphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and Pediococcus cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used for comparative enzyme immunological studies; the Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique and the quantitative microcomplement fixation procedure were employed. The reactions obtained provide evidence showing that all seven ACholeplasma species studied (A. laidlawii, A. granularum, A. modicum, A. oculi, A. axanthum. A. hippikon, and A. equifetale) are phylogenetically related to streptococci and that they evolved from streptococci. The data strongly suggest that the acholeplasmas comprise a distinct evolutionary group that has diverged from streptococci belonging to Lancefield group D or N. No reactions were observed between these enzyme antisera and cell extracts from six fermentative Mycoplasma species. These results support the view that mycoplasmas are derived from various bacteria.

TI  - [Activity of new beta-lactam antibiotics].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the newer beta-lactam compounds mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, lamoxactam, and cefsulodin was evaluated in 335 strains of ampicillin-resistant (MIC greater than 16 mg/l) enterobacteria, 50 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 28 acinetobacter species, and 50 streptococcus faecalis isolates. With the exception of some strains, enterobacteria were inhibited by low levels of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime, respectively. Between these both compounds there was an almost complete cross-resistance. In each species lamoxactam inhibited at least 90% of the isolates. The antibacterial activity of cefoperazone against enterobacteria was decreased; however, it was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to that of azlocillin. Cefsulodin proved to be the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa exceeding to some extent even piperacillin. Ceftizoxime was the most active drug against acinetobacter species. Among the new cephalosporins, it was only cefoperazone that exhibitediting antibacterial activity comparable to that of azlocillin. Cefsulodin proved to be the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa exceeding to some extent even piperacillin. Ceftizoxime was the most active drug against acinetobacter species. Among the new cephalosporins, it was only cefoperazone that exhibitediting antibacterial activity comparable to that of azlocillin. Cefsulodin proved to be the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa exceeding to some extent even piperacillin. Ceftizoxime was the most active drug against acinetobacter species. Among the new cephalosporins, it was only cefoperazone that exhibited some activity against streptococcus faecalis, which was comparable to that of cephalothin, but markedly impaired to that of cefazedone. With respect to streptococcus faecalis, the penicillin derivatives still remain the by far most active compounds.
TI  - Growth of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes on glycerol: the effect of aerobic and anaerobic growth in the presence and absence of haematin on enzyme synthesis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was grown aerobically and anaerobically in  the presence and absence of haematin, with glycerol as the carbon and energy source. Aerobic growth was stimulated by the inclusion of haematin in the medium but fumarate had no effect on growth. The bacterium was unable to grow anaerobically on glycerol unless fumarate was present; haematin had no effect on growth. NADH oxidase activity, which catalysed the oxidation of NADH + H+ to form H2O rather than H2O2, was found in the soluble fraction and was induced by aerobic growth but partially repressed when haematin was present in the medium. In contrast, a particulate NADH oxidase, which was sensitive to inhibition by antimycin A and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, was induced by aerobic growth in the presence of haematin. NADH peroxidase was massively induced by aerobic growth, whereas more lactate dehydrogenase activity was found in anaerobically grown bacteria. Catalase was formed only during aerobic growth in the presence of haematin.
TI  - Comparison of recovery of organisms from blood cultures diluted 10% (volume/volume) and 20% (volume/volume).
AB  - We compared blood cultures that were diluted 1:5 (20%, vol/vol) and 1:10 (10%, vol/vol) and contained specimens from patients with suspected septicemia. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered significantly more frequently from blood cultures diluted 20%, whereas gram-negative bacilli, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp. were recovered significantly sooner and more frequently from blood cultures diluted 10%. Statistically significant differences in isolation rates, however, represented only a small number of patients for whom the positive cultures affected therapy. We conclude that as long as at least two separate sets of blood cultures are obtained per septic episode from each patient, a 1:5 to 1:10 blood/vented (aerobic) medium ratio provides acceptable results. Nevertheless, the results also demonstrate that blood cultures diluted 10% provided greater and faster yields than those provided by blood cultures diluted 20%.
TI  - Characterization of two tetracycline resistance determinants in Streptococcus faecalis JH1.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strain JH1 harbors two conjugative plasmids: pJH1, an R plasmid mediating resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, and pJH2, a hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid. Studies of plasmid-cured derivatives of strain JH1 and of transconjugates obtained after mixed incubation of JH1 with the plasmid-free S. faecalis strain JH2-2 revealed the presence of two tetracycline resistance determinants in strain JH1. One determinant mediated constitutive resistance to 40 micrograms of tetracycline per ml and was associated with plasmid pJH1. The second determinant, either on the chromosome of strain JH1 or on an undetectable plasmid, was inducible by tetracycline and enabled the host strain, in the absence of pJH1, to grow in the presence of 80 micrograms of tetracycline per ml. One transconjugant, strain DL172, was resistant to 80 micrograms of tetracycline per ml, sensitive to kanamycin, streptomycin, and erythromycin, and hemolytic in the presence, but not in the absence, of tetracycline. A single plasmid, pDL172, from this strain consisted of plasmid pJH2 and a 17.8-kilobase segment of DNA homologous to total cell DNA from strain JH1 but did not contain plasmid pJH1. Whether the addition of heterologous DNA to plasmid pJH2 occurred by translocation of a 17.8-kilobase tetracycline resistance transposon or by classical recombination with pJH2 has not been determined.
TI  - ATP-driven sodium pump in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Sodium extrusion by bacteria is generally attributed to secondary antiport of Na+ for H+ energized by the proton circulation. Streptococcus faecalis is an exception, in that sodium expulsion from intact cells requires the generation of ATP but does not depend on the protonmotive force. Unfortunately, studies with everted membrane vesicles failed to reveal the expected sodium pump; instead, the vesicles contained a conventional secondary Na+/H+ antiporter. We report here that everted membrane vesicles prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors retain an ATP-driven sodium transport system. The evidence includes the findings that (i) accumulation of 22Na+ by these vesicles is resistant to reagents that dissipate the protonmotive force but requires ATP and (ii) the vesicles contain a sodium-stimulated ATPase that is distinct from F1F0 ATPase, and whose presence is correlated with sodium transport activity. Sodium movements appear to be electroneutral and are accompanied by movement of H+ in the opposite direction. When membranes are incubated in the absence of protease inhibitors, a secondary Na+/H+ antiport activity emerges, possibly by degradation of the sodium pump. We suggest that S. faecalis expels Na+ by means of an ATP-driven primary transport system that mediates exchange of Na+ for H+. The Na+/H+ antiporter seen in earlier membrane preparation is an artefact of proteolytic degradation.
TI  - Second system for potassium transport in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - It has been reported that the accumulation of K+ by Streptococcus faecalis is mediated by a transport system which required both ATP and the proton motive force (Bakker and Harold, J. Biol. Chem. 255:433-440, 1980). My results indicate that S. faecalis has a second transport system for K+. The features of this system are as follows: (i) the system is driven by ATP (or a derivative of ATP) and does not require the proton motive force; (ii) the system is normally absent in the wild-type strain but can be derepressed by lowering rhe intracellular concentration of K+; (iii) the pH optimum of this system is about 8.5, and no detectable K+ is accumulated at pH values below 6.5; and (iv) the rate of Rb+ accumulation by this system is very low. These properties are quite different from those of the transport system described by Bakker and Harold. Therefore, I propose that S. faecalis has two K+ transport systems.
TI  - Role of glutathione in the regulation of inorganic pyrophosphatase activity in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - When the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide was added to a batch culture of Streptococcus faecalis during exponential growth, the specific activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) decreased to the level observed in the stationary phase. The effect of diamide was completely reversed by reduced glutathione. Furthermore, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione and the specific activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase changed in a very similar fashion during batch culture. These findings, together with our earlier results, suggest that the activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase in S. faecalis is regulated by glutathione via the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione.

TI  - Membrane stimulation and intracellular killing by monocytes.
AB  - The present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. The findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the Fc part of IgG and complement component C3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. Similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. The studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.

TI  - Anatomical and immunological responses of rabbit gallbladders to bacterial infections.
AB  - To study the sequential morphological and immunological response of the rabbit gallbladder to bacterial infection and to compare the inflammatory responses with different pathogens, gallbladders were infected with Streptococcus faecalis and two strains of Escherichia coli, one of which produced enterotoxin. Gallbladder infection was produced either by intravenously injecting bacteria into rabbits with a small liver infarct or by injecting bacteria directly into the gallbladder of normal rabbits. The percentage of gallbladders infected intravenously with a nonenterotoxigenic E. coli strain was 86% at 1 week, 70% at 3 weeks, and 15% at 6 weeks. Epithelial necrosis and leukocyte infiltration were prominent 1 week after infection. At 3 and 6 weeks after infection, there was crypt distortion and increased mucus secretion in the epithelium as shown by periodic acid-Schiff staining. The lamina propria was infiltrated with mononuclear cells, many of which were plasma cells. Myofibroblasts (contractile fibroblasts) were also identified on transmission microscopy, In addition to these changes, toxigenic E. coli produced subepithelial capillary dilation in the villus core. Morphological changes (excluding toxin-associated changes) were related to the duration of infection rather than to the specific species of infecting bacteria. Infected gallbladders studied by immunofluorescence had a greater than 50-fold increase in plasma cells compared with control cells. In addition, the number increased with the duration of infection. Immunoglobulin A cells were the major cell type in gallbladders infected by intravesical injection, whereas immunoglobulin G cells predominated in gallbladders infected intravenously. The gallbladder appears to mount a local immune response to bacterial infection.
TI  - Effect of twelve antimicrobial drugs on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract of mice and on endogenous potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Twelve antimicrobial drugs were studied for their effect on the endogenous aerobic potentially pathogenic bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus faecalis) in the intestines and on the colonization resistance (CR) of the digestive tract. Three subclasses of antimicrobial drugs could be recognized: (1) those which suppress the CR following low oral doses (rifamycin, penicillin V, cloxacillin, fenethicillin); (2) those in which the CR is suppressed only following relatively high oral doses (amoxycillin); and (3) those in which no obvious suppression of the CR was noticed even following substantial oral doses (nalidixic acid, cinoxacin, co-trimoxazole, oral cephalosporins, piv-mecillinam and doxycyclin). Some of the drugs in the third category were found to suppress endogenous Enterobacteriaceae (nalidixic acid, co-trimoxazole, piv-mecillinam and doxycyclin) and S. faecalis (doxycyclin) at dose levels at which they did not decrease CR.
TI  - Heterogeneity of tetracycline resistance determinants in Streptococcus.
AB  - We found that naturally occurring tetracycline resistance in streptococci is encoded by more than one genetic determinant. Two of these distinct determinants were cloned, and the regions that are necessary and sufficient for expression of tetracycline resistance were defined by deletion analysis. These cloned determinants were further characterized by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments which also identified a third genetically unrelated tetracycline resistance determinant. Some of these genetic differences appear to represent mechanistic differences. The tetL determinant was associated with small nonconjugative plasmids and mediated resistance to tetracycline. The tetM determinant was most often "nonplasmid" associated and mediated resistance to minocycline as well as tetracycline. The tetN determinant was represented on a large conjugative plasmid and was genetically distinct from tetL and tetM, although phenotypically it resembled tetM.
TI  - High performance liquid chromatography of folates: identification of poly-gamma-glutamate chain lengths of labeled and unlabeled folates.
AB  - A sensitive method is described for the identification of the polyglutamate chain lengths of labeled and unlabeled folates in biological extracts. Folates in bacterial or mammalian tissue extracts were quantitatively cleaved to rho-aminobenzoylpolyglutamates. The primary aromatic amines were converted to azo dyes of naphthylethylene diamine and were purified by chromatography on BioGel P2 polyacrylamide columns. The purified azo dyes were reductively reconverted to rho-aminobenzoylpolyglutamates, which were separated according to glutamate chain length by high performance liquid chromatography on a Partisil 10 SAX anionic exchanger. Unlabeled derivatives derived from tissue folates were detected and quantitated by their absorbance at 280 nm. Lactobacillus casei contained folates of glutamate chain length up to 11 with the octa- and nonaglutamates predominating, while tetraglutamates predominated in Streptococcus faecalis. Vitamin in rat liver was a mixture of pteroylmono- to heptaglutamate with the pentaglutamate predominating.

TI  - Influence of Escherichia coli on Streptococcus faecalis in mixed cultures and experimental animal infections.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli (four strains) and Streptococcus faecalis (three strains) randomly isolated from faecal samples were cultured together in vitro and in experimental animal infections in order to evaluate the interaction of these two species. Streptococcus faecalis was eliminated from mixed cultures and infections at population ratios of Escherichia coli to Streptococcus faecalis of 10-100:1. The mechanism involved was probably an antibiotic substance produced by Escherichia coli which was antagonistic to Streptococcus faecalis. The substance appeared to be diffusible, water-soluble, of low molecular weight and insensitive to the protease trypsin. It was produced and remained active in vitro and in vivo and can probably be classified as a microcin.

TI  - Experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 6. Results of long-term combined therapy of Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis with penicillin and streptomycin.
AB  - The synergistic action of penicillin and streptomycin was investigated on animals with experimental endocarditis, using the previously described model and four different strains of Streptococcus faecalis. Two strains represented a moderate and two strains a high level of resistance to streptomycin. The purpose was to determine the effect of the combined penicillin and streptomycin treatment, since previous in vitro investigations showed that strains highly resistant to streptomycin were also resistant to combination of the drugs. Antibiotic treatment of the animals was carried out for 28 days, followed by a period of four weeks observation. The treatment resulted in a demonstrable effect against infection caused by the least streptomycin-resistant strain, but was completely ineffective in rabbits infected with the strain homogeneously resistant to 8000 micrograms/ml streptomycin. The synergistic effect of penicillin and streptomycin towards strains within a range of streptomycin resistance of 2000-8000 micrograms/ml could be predicted by the IC50 test, but not by MIC or the in vitro killing curve test for synergism. Besides the therapeutic results, this report also considers the following features: pathoanatomic and physiologic processes related to the number of viable bacteria in the endocardial vegetations; the influence of the proteolytic capacity of infecting strains; the development of congestive heart failure.
TI  - Experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 5. Results of long-term penicillin or streptomycin treatment of streptococcus faecalis endocarditis and the effect of long-term exposure of healthy rabbits to the same drugs.
AB  - A previously described model of experimental Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis  in rabbits without an indwelling catheter during the infectious processes was used to study the effect of long-term treatment with antibiotics. Groups of animals infected with six different strains were treated for four weeks and the following parameters were determined: survival rate, bacterial concentration in blood and vegetations, signs at autopsy indicating congestive heart failure. Before the therapeutic experiments, the tolerance of the rabbit to long-term exposure of the drugs penicillin and streptomycin was considered in a group of non-infected animals. Two out of 20 rabbits died with enteritis during the penicillin exposure, and a general weight reduction was observed. Streptomycin was apparently completely harmless. There was no therapeutic effect of streptomycin on S. faecalis endocarditis due to strains all designated resistant to streptomycin by MIC, except in rabbits infected with a strain, which showed partial susceptibility to the drug by IC50. Regardless of the therapeutic effect, evidence was obtained for rapid development of increased resistance of the infecting strains towards streptomycin. After long-term treatment with penicillin in either low or high dose some of the animals survived and the valves were sterilized in 37% of the animals after low-dose and in 39% after high-dose. It was observed that congestive heart failure occurred with the greatest frequency and intensity after infection with proteolytic strains.
TI  - Enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Ten to twenty percent of all cases of bacterial endocarditis are caused by enterococci. The enterococci are penicillin-resistant group D streptococci that can be distinguished from other streptococci by certain biochemical reactions, including growing the bile or 6.5% sodium chloride. In patients with enterococcal endocarditis, the portal of entry often is the genitourinary tract. Therapy is difficult; combination chemotherapy with penicillin G or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside is required. Although specimen streptomycin is preferred, occasional strains of enterococci are resistant to this agent, and gentamicin must be substituted. The minimal duration of therapy is 4 weeks.
TI  - Dietary fibre, bacterial metabolism and toxicity of nitrate in the rat.
AB  - 1. A semi-synthetic diet, the semi-synthetic diet plus pectin, and a stock diet were fed to rats, and three metabolic functions of the caecal bacteria (reduction of amaranth, p-nitrobenzoic acid and nitrate) were measured in vitro. 2. No consistent differences were noted between diets for the reduction of amaranth and p-nitrobenzoic acid. 3. No consistent differences in nitrate reductase activity were noted for rats maintained on a stock diet or a fibre-free diet. However, the addition of 5% pectin to the latter diet resulted in a several-fold increase in nitrite production. 4. This increased nitrite production in vitro was associated with methaemoglobinaemia following the oral administration of nitrate to rats fed the diet containing pectin. Animals receiving the basal fibre-free diet were unaffected by nitrate.
TI  - Bacterial invasion of pulpal dentin wall in vitro.
AB  - Instrumented root canals of extracted human teeth were inoculated with known pulpal bacterial isolates. The inoculated teeth were immersed in the appropriate culture media and incubated at 37 degrees C for varying periods. Streptococci multiplied in the root canals and invaded the radicular dentinal tubules. The extent of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. This experimental model of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. This experimental model may be useful in investigating the effect of intra-canal medicaments on microorganisms lodged in the pulpal dentin wall.
TI  - beta-D-Glucose 1-phosphate. A structural unit and an immunological determinant of a glycan from streptococcal cell walls.
AB  - Glycose 1-phosphate moieties are emerging as important structural units of macromolecular substances imparting special biological functions to these molecules. In the present study, beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate moieties are shown to be structural units and immunological determinants of a bacterial glycan. The glycan is a tetraheteroglycan from the cell wall of Streptococcus faecalis, strain N and is composed of glucose, galactose, rhamnose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and phosphate. Several lines of evidence have been obtained for the presence of beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate units in the glycan, including the liberation of glucose by mild acid hydrolysis, the inhibition of the precipitin reaction by beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate, and the formation of levoglucosan on treatment of the glycan with alkali. Work on the preparation of affinity adsorbents for isolating the new types of antibodies directed at the beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate moieties is in progress.
TI  - Identification of group D streptococci by SeroSTAT.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group D streptococci presumptively identified by biochemical methods were grouped by latex agglutination using a commercially prepared reagent specifically sensitized with group D antiserum (SeroSTAT; Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskeville, R.I.). Streptococcus species tested included S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. durans, S. avium, S. bovis, and S. equinus. Colonies of the organism to be tested were picked from agar plates, emulsified in a drop of glycine-buffered saline on a slide, and mixed with a drop of the latex reagent. Macroscopic agglutination occurred within 60 s. A total of 115 isolates of group D streptococci were tested; 103 (89.6%) gave positive reactions with SeroSTAT. Twelve strains failed to react with the latex reagent; these 12 strains also gave negative results with group D antiserum when tested by the Lancefield method. Two of 14 group A streptococci also reacted with the SeroSTAT group D reagent; after trypsinization, the cross-reaction was eliminated. Group B streptococci, viridans group streptococci, anaerobic streptococci, and staphylococci all gave negative reactions with the SeroSTAT reagent. The SeroSTAT reagent is a useful diagnostic tool for the prompt identification of enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci.

TI  - Ceftazidime in the treatment of urinary tract infection.
AB  - Twenty-nine patients with urinary tract infection were treated with ceftazidime intramuscularly, at a dosage of 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The patient series was predominantly geriatric, with a mean age of 70.9 years and including 17 patients over 75 years. Nine had an in-dwelling catheter and azotaemia was found in 14 cases. In this clinically difficult group, a positive bacteriological response to treatment was obtained in 72.9% and, if patients with in-dwelling catheters are excluded, 90% were cured. Ceftazidime-resistant Streptococcus faecalis was cultured before treatment in 6 of the 8 unsuccessful cases. In the remaining 2 treatment failures, Streptococcus faecalis was isolated immediately after treatment. In terms of clinical response to therapy all patients were cured or improved. Treatment with ceftazidime was well tolerated. No subjective side-effects occurred. One patient developed a distinct but transient elevation of liver enzymes, and in 2 cases a negative direct Coombs test was temporarily positive.

TI  - Quantitative bacteriological analysis of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Quantitative bacteriological analysis of amniotic fluid (AF) was performed on 60  fluid samples collected by catheter from 50 selected labor patients regarded as liable to infection. AF cultures were positive in 52 cases. The bacterial colony counts ranged from less than 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter to 10(9) CFU/ml. Pathogenic bacteria in neonates such as group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes were encountered with numerations equal to or greater than 10(7) CFU/ml in groups with clinical findings. An excellent correlation was noted between bacterial counts in AF and clinical data (p less than 0.00006). The results confirm that the quantitative bacteria analysis of the AF is a useful tool for evaluation of an infection risk for neonates.
TI  - Pyrolysis gas chromatography of Streptococcus faecalis: effect of cultural conditions on pyrochromatograms.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis 251 was cultured under a variety of different growth conditions, i.e. incubation for 24 or 70 h; at 22 degrees, 37 degrees or 45 degrees C; on blood agar or on MacConkey agar plates; aerobically or anaerobically. Replicate cultures were analysed by pyrolysis-gas liquid chromatography on columns of 7% Carbowax 2 M, TPA on Chromosorb G (AW-DMCS, 80-100 mesh) programmed from 40 degrees C up to 170 degrees C. Culture grown under identical conditions resulted in reproducible pyrochromatograms which were only slightly modified by change in temperature of growth from 37 degrees to 45 degrees C, or length of growth from 24 to 70 h, or growth on MacConkey agar instead of blood agar. Growth under anaerobic conditions resulted in a modified pyrochromatogram; while growth at only 22 degrees C resulted in a major change in pyrochromatogram.
TI  - Nonspecificity of some commonly used inhibitors of DNA synthesis in cultures of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The specificity of three commonly used inhibitors of DNA synthesis were tested in the batch culture of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 in rich broth medium. It was shown that nalidixic acid, mitomycin C and 6-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)uracil inhibit the growth of the cell mass as much as they decrease net DNA synthesis. Hence the drugs tested are highly unspecific inhibitors of DNA synthesis in S. faecalis; i.e. they all interfere with other processes as well as with DNA synthesis.

AB  - The growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. Subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators E. coli (faecal indicator), Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), Enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), Staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and Bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). It was found that --Hydrodictyon reticulatum and Aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while Chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. With respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. Therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

TI  - Experimental Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis  pyelonephritis in diabetic rats.
AB  - Pyelonephritis was studied after an intravenous injection of Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, or enterococcus in alloxan-diabetic rats and in water-diuresing or non-diuresing nondiabetic rats. The renal microbial populations of C. albicans or S. aureus were found to be greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per g for up to 42 days in diabetic rats, whereas the kidneys tended to become sterile in nondiabetic rats. No significant difference was found in the course of enterococcal pyelonephritis in diabetic versus control rats. The difference in the 50% infective dose for each microorganism between diabetic and control rats was less than or equal to log10. Neither duration of diabetes nor weight loss contributed to the greater and more sustained renal populations of C. albicans and S. aureus in diabetic rats. The inflammatory reaction in kidneys infected with S. aureus or C. albicans was greater in diabetic rats. Fungus balls associated with ureteral obstruction and gross multiple renal abscesses occurred in diabetic, but not in nondiabetic, rats infected with Candida. Growth of C. albicans and S. aureus in vitro in urine from diabetic rats was significantly greater than it was in urine from control rats. Addition of water or glucose to the urine of non-diuresing, nondiabetic rats significantly increased in vitro growth of S. aureus and C. albicans. These studies demonstrate greater severity of infection in the diabetic kidney due to S. aureus and C. albicans, which can be partially explained by decreased inhibitory activity of urine for these organisms in diabetic rats.
TI  - Some structural and physiological properties of fimbriae of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Three strains of Streptococcus faecalis examined by negative-staining showed the  presence of flexible, peritrichous fimbriae on the cell surface. These structures were up to 0.5 micron long and 4.5 nm in diameter. The numbers of fimbriae per cell varied from a few to hundreds, and not all cells in a culture were fimbriate. Two strains were selected for particular study: strain JH2, which is plasmid free, and strain JH3, which carries a self-transferable plasmid, pJH3. Fimbriation varied with the growth phase and was maximum in late-exponential phase for strain JH2, and early-stationary phase for strain JH3. The maximum percentage of fimbriate cells produced was within the range 75-90% for strain JH2 and 40-53% for strain JH3. Both strains showed a decrease in the percentage of fimbriate cells in stationary phase dropping very rapidly in strain JH2 and less rapidly in strain JH3. Fimbriae were present on cells grown under a variety of environmental conditions. No surface structures unique to the plasmid-containing strains were found.
TI  - [Results from the Central Laboratory for Streptococci Research in Kiel from 1965  to 1980 - group D-streptococci (enterococci) (author's transl)].
AB  - In accordance with previous papers published within a series of publications which describe the results obtained from the Central Laboratory for Streptococcal Research in Kiel (1. Survey, 2. Mastitis-Streptococci) the group of Enterococci is discussed herewith. On the basis of more than 6000 strains which are stored in our databank including all biological characteristics, the distribution of the cultural, biochemical and serological parameters is listed in percentages, and the usefulness and reliability for the identification of the enterococcal group and also the differentiation of particular species is discussed. The results are tabulated for every single species and additionally, for serologic-positive and negative strains. For example, it can be shown that a third of all Str. faecium strains are motile, that lack of growth at 45 degrees C varies between 1.1% and 31.3% and that lack of serological reaction with group D-serum between 0.9% and 70%. In a comprehensive table and flow diagram these figures result in a proposal for a simple but sufficient identification procedure on different stages (enterococci, faecalis- or faecium-group, single species) depending on the individual requirements. With regard to the incidence of enterococci in man and animals, which was presented in the first paper, the organ sources of the different species are compared now. Apart from some interesting findings it can be stated that a typical predominance of the faecalis and faecium-group resp. in man or animals cannot be confirmed. But there seems to be a relation between the species and the organ source. For example, in humans the faecium-group predominates in the respiratory tract, but in the urogenital tract the presence of Str. faecalis is seven times higher than the faecium-group. The above results may also be of interest for ecological reasons and may be important for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this streptococcal group.

TI  - Bacterial endocarditis in the community hospital.
AB  - The clinical records of 66 patients with bacterial endocarditis hospitalized in three community hospitals in Saginaw, Michigan, from 1964 through 1979 were reviewed. Data from these nonreferral hospitals demonstrate that infective endocarditis often does not present to the primary care physician with classical physical findings. The etiological organisms were noted to change from being primarily alpha-hemolytic streptococci during the early part of the study to staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis during later years. Narcotic addiction was a factor of increasing importance in the development of endocarditis and in the changing microbiology of this clinical syndrome.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on streptococcal adhesion in vitro and the development of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. Subinhibitory concentrations (subMIC) of some antibiotics decrease bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro. We utilized an in vitro assay system to study the effect of subMIC of various antibiotics on streptococcal adhesion to a fibrin-platelet matrix (simulating NBTE). The results were (a) bacterial adhesion of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus faecalis to NBTE was significantly reduced by vancomycin, penicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin (P less than 0.01 vs. controls) but not rifampin or trimethoprimsulfametrole; (b) the effect was dose-dependent and increased with duration of exposure to antibiotic; (c) reduction in bacterial adhesion did not correlate with altered retention by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. This reduction in adhesion correlated with a diminished capacity of subMIC exposed Streptococcus sanguis (1/4 vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) X 4 h) to produce endocarditis in vivo. After intravenous inoculation of 10(6) colony-forming units of preincubated organisms into rabbits with traumatized aortic valves, 6 of 22 developed endocarditis vs. 17 of 22 controls (P = 0.03). These results may be relevant to prophylaxis of endocarditis since exposure of bacteria to subMIC of various antibiotics may reduce bacterial adherence both, to mucosal surfaces, and to damaged cardiac valves.
TI  - Rifampin, ampicillin, streptomycin, and their combinations in the treatment of enterococcal pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The activities of ampicillin, rifampin, streptomycin, and their combinations were evaluated in vitro against Streptococcus faecalis strain GK and in vivo in rats with an established pyelonephritis resulting from challenge with this same enterococcus. In vitro synergy was demonstrated between all combinations. Comparison of the log colony-forming units of S. faecalis recovered per gram of kidney tissue showed that all treated groups had significant lower numbers than controls (P less than 0.001). Ampicillin plus streptomycin or ampicillin alone was superior to rifampin alone or rifampin plus streptomycin at each interval (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between ampicillin and rifampin plus ampicillin. The disparity between in vitro and in vivo results again raises some doubts as to the relevance of in vitro observations to clinical outcome.

TI  - Homology among tet determinants in conjugative elements of streptococci.
AB  - A mutation to tetracycline sensitivity in a resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was shown by several criteria to be due to a point mutation in the conjugative omega (cat-tet) element found in the chromosomes of strains derived from BM6001, a clinical strain resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Strains carrying the mutation were transformed back to tetracycline resistance with the high efficiency of a point marker by donor deoxyribonucleic acids from its ancestral strain and from nine other clinical isolates of pneumococcus and by deoxyribonucleic acids from group D Streptococcus faecalis and group B Streptococcus agalactiae strains that also carry conjugative tet elements in their chromosomes. It was not transformed to resistance by tet plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids from either gram-negative or gram-positive species, except for one that carried transposon Tn916, the conjugative tet element present in the chromosomes of some S. faecalis strains. The results showed that the tet determinants in conjugative elements of several streptococcal species share a high degree of deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homology and suggested that they differ from other tet genes.
TI  - Folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthesis by bacteria and mammalian cells.
AB  - The purification and properties of folylpolyglutamate synthetase from Corynebacterium sp, and some properties of partially purified enzyme from Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis, Neurospora crassa, pig liver, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, are described. The Corynebacterium enzyme catalyzes a MgATP-dependent addition of glutamate to a variety of reduced pteroate and pteroylmono-, di-, and triglutamate substrates, with the concomitant production of MgADP and phosphate. Although glutamate moieties are added in a sequential fashion, the kinetic mechanism, which is Ordered Ter Ter, precludes the sequential addition of glutamate moieties to enzyme-bound folate. It is suggested that catalysis precedes via the formation of a pteroyl-gamma-glutamyl phosphate intermediate. The in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria and mammalian cells, which differ from source to source, appear to be a reflection of the ability of folylpolyglutamates to act as substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases from different sources. Only one enzyme appears to be involved in the conversion of pteroylmonoglutamates to polyglutamate forms in both bacteria and mammalian cells. Bacterial folylpolyglutamate synthetases use a variety of pteroylmonoglutamates as their preferred monoglutamate substrate, but use 5,10-methylenetetrahydro-pteroylpolyglutamates as their preferred, and sometimes only, polyglutamate substrate. Mono- and polyglutamyl forms of tetrahydrofolate are the preferred substrates of mammalian folylpolyglutamate synthetases.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.
TI  - Experimental retrograde pyelonephritis and cystitis induced in rabbits by a group D Streptococcus sp.: serum antibody assay by a hemagglutination test.
AB  - Experimental models of urinary tract infection caused by a group D Streptococcus  sp. in rabbits are described: retrograde pyelonephritis was induced by injecting 10(9) group D streptococci into the renal pelvis and obstructing the ureter by ligature for 24 h; cystitis was induced by injecting 5.10(9) group D streptococci through a transurethral catheter. The animals were observed for 3 months. Microbiological data from the urine and from the renal parenchyma were well correlated in 12 of 14 animals. A hemagglutination test for titration of serum antibodies in these infected rabbits is described. Before the beginning of experimentation, hemagglutination titers for all animals were below 160. During experimentation, titers for rabbits with cystitis were always below 640; in those with pyelonephritis, the highest titer was much greater than 640. These results show a positive correlation between serum antibody levels and the localization of urinary tract infection.

TI  - Interconversion of components of the bacterial proton motive force by electrogenic potassium transport.
AB  - The influence of K+ ions on the components of the transmembrane proton motive force (delta mu H+) in intact bacteria was investigated. In K+-depleted cells of the glycolytic bacterium STreptococcus faecalis the addition of K+ ions caused a depolarization of the membrane by about 60 mV. However, since the depolarization was compensated for by an increase in the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH), the total proton motive force remained almost constant at about 120 mV. Half-maximal changes in the potential were observed at K+ concentrations at which the cells accumulated K+ ions extensively. In EDTA-treated, K+-depleted cells of Escherichia coli K-12, the addition of K+ ions to the medium caused similar, although smaller changes in the components of delta mu H+. Experiments with various E. coli K-12 K+ transport mutants showed that for the observed potential changes the cells required either a functional TrkA or Kdp K+ transport system. These data are interpreted to mean that the inward movement of K+ ions via each of these bacterial transport systems is electrogenic. Consequently, it leads to a depolarization of the membrane, which in its turn allows the cell to pump more protons into the medium.
TI  - Reverse and forward reactions of carbamyl phosphokinase from Streptococcus faecalis R. Participation of nucleotides and reaction mechanisms.
AB  - The participation of Mg complex of nucleoside diphosphates and nucleoside triphosphates in the reverse and forward reactions catalyzed by purified carbamyl phosphokinase (ATP : carbamate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.2) of Streptococcus faecalis R, ATCC-8043 were studied. The results of initial velocity studies of approx. 1 mM free Mg2+ concentration have indicated that in the reverse reaction MgdADP was as effective a substrate as MgADP. The phosphoryl group transfer from carbamyl phosphate to MgGDP, MgCDP and MgUDP was also observed at relatively higher concentrations of the enzyme and respective magnesium nucleoside diphosphate. In the forward direction MgdATP was found to be as efficient a phosphate donor as MgATP. On the other hand, Mg complexes of GTP, CTP and UTP were ineffective even at higher concentrations of the enzyme and respective magnesium nucleoside triphosphate. Product inhibition studies carried out at non-inhibitory level of approx. 1 mM free Mg2+ concentration have revealed that the enzyme has two distinct sites, one for nucleoside diphosphate or nucleoside triphosphate and the other for carbamyl phosphate or carbamate, and its reaction with the substrates is of the random type. Further tests of numerical values for kinetic constants have indicated that they are partially consistent with the Haldane relationship which is characteristic of rapid equilibrium and random mechanism.
TI  - [Prophylaxis and treatment of streptococcus infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Authors review and bring up to date problems related to prophylaxis and treatment of streptococcus infections in children. In those caused by the Group A streptococcus, the problem is rather one of medical education and practical application of techniques, and medicines. Active vaccination is still a remote possibility. In the case of streptococcus B and its perinatological incidence, there is still no standard therapeutic prophylaxis covering both the mother and child. With reference to streptococcus D plans proposed are somewhat discordant since it is difficult to carry out studies with sufficiently large groups but there are also proposals which can be carried out perfectly well and are reasonably safe. As far as the infectious, and to a great extent contagious, processes are concerned, measures of individual and collective hygiene are particularly important.
TI  - Radiosensitization of microorganisms by radical anions. II. Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The inactivation of Streptococcus faecalis by radiolytically generated selective  inorganic radical anions was investigated. The Br-2 radical, but not (CNS)-2, had a pronounced radiosensitizing action. In gamma-irradiated solutions at pH 7.0, the radiosensitization of a variety of scavenging systems was studied. Among these the D10 for N2/Br- was 0.082 kGy while N2O/CNS- = 0.35 kGy, N2O = 0.25 kGy, N2 = 0.47, and O2 = 0.16 kGy. As shown previously, inactivation in N2O/Br- systems is due mainly to Br2 and HOBr. From the variation of the inactivation with pH by Br-2 and (CNS)-2 it was deduced that tyrosine is crucial for the survival of S. faecalis via inactivation of enzymes with essential tyrosine residues such as aldolase and lipoyl dehydrogenase which are presumably needed to make energy available for DNA repair. Studies with a variety of scavengers also revealed that the t-butanol radical produced some radiosensitization of S. faecalis while the damaging effect of e-aq was much less than OH as shown by the D10 at pH 7.0; N2/t-butanol = 0.32 and N2/ethanol = 0.71. The radiosensitizing action of Br-2 in a natural environment containing sewage sludge was also determined, using the faecal streptococcal group as test organisms.
TI  - Radiosensitization of microorganisms by radical anions. I. Medium effects.
AB  - Irradiation of Streptococcus faecalis in a neutral, N2O/Br- system leads to practically complete killing with extraordinarily low doses of irradiation, namely a D10 of 13 Gy compared to 470 Gy in N2, 250 Gy in N2O and 160 Gy in O2. However, irradiation and chemical investigations demonstrated that the apparent radiosensitization in neutral, N2O/Br- is due mainly to bromine, Br2 and HOBr rather than Br-3 or the radical anion, Br-2. For example, addition of unirradiated bacteria to a previously irradiated neutral solution of N2O/Br- reduces survival. The medium effects are eliminated by radiation chemical and/or chemical reactions which destroy bromine, such as occur in basic solutions, in N2/Br- or O2/Br- systems because of back reactions of Br2 with e-aq in the former and of Br2 with H2O2 and O-2 in the latter. Neither are medium effects produced in N2O/Br- systems at pH greater than 9. However, in N2/Br- the D10 = 82 Gy compared to 160 Gy in O2 which indicates that for S. faecalis Br-2 is intrinsically a more effective radiosensitizing agent than oxygen.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the membrane adenosine triphosphatase complex from the wild-type and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-resistant strains of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We have purified the F1-F0 adenosine triphosphatase complex from wild-type Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 and an N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-resistant mutant strain, SF-dcc-8. For preliminary purification of the complex, reconstituted F1-F0, prepared from isolated F1 adenosine triphosphatase and depleted membranes, was extracted with sodium deoxycholate and fractionated by salt precipitation. By means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the F1-F0 complex was purified as a single, catalytically active band in the first dimension and then resolved into constituent subunits under denaturing conditions in the second dimension. The electrophoretic purification of F1-F0 removed a delta-less form of F1 as well as other impurities, including lipoteichoic acid. Both the DCCD-sensitive and the DCCD-resistant F1-F0 adenosine triphosphatase appeared to consist of eight proteins, five of which corresponded to the F1 subunits alpha, beta,, gamma, delta, and epsilon. The F0 sector proteins, designated M27, M15, and M6, had Mr values of 27,000, 15,000, and 6,000, respectively. There appear to be multiple copies of M6 in the complex. [14C]DCCD reacted specifically and covalently with M6 in the wild-type F1-F0 but failed to label the M6 protein in the complex from the DCCD-resistant strain. It is suggested that DCCD resistance in the SF-dcc-8 mutant may be due to a modification of the M6 protein which hinders access of DCCD to the reactive site.

TI  - [Causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.
TI  - Effects of physiologic variations in temperature on the rate of antibiotic-induced bacterial killing.
AB  - The effects of physiologic temperature variations on antibiotic-induced killing of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied. At concentrations less than or equal to four times the minimal bactericidal concentration, the activity of each of the antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate, sodium ampicillin, and chloramphenicol) against the test bacteria was influenced by changes in temperature. Only with S. pneumoniae did such influence appear to result directly from temperature-induced changes in the multiplication rate of the bacteria. Repeated subculturing of bacteria at 41 degrees C to induce temperature adaptation had a variable effect on the rate of bacterial killing by appropriate antibiotics. The magnitude of the effect of temperature on antibiotic-induced rates of bacterial killing varies with the antibiotic class, the species of bacteria, and the temperature to which bacteria have been adapted.
TI  - Leukocyte and 67Ga-citrate dynamics in experimental subcutaneous Streptococcus faecalis infections.
AB  - The dynamics of white blood cell (WBC) and 67Ga-citrate accumulation were studied in rabbits with subcutaneous polyethylene chambers. Uninfected chamber fluid (CF) contained less than 1,000 WBCs/mm3, most of which were mononuclear. After 67Ga injection, radioactivity increased slowly in uninfected fluid, peaked between 24 and 48 hours, and then gradually decreased. 67Ga scans showed no uptake in excess of background levels around the uninfected chambers. After injection of Streptococcus faecalis directly into the chambers, bacterial concentrations initially decreased, increased by 4-24 hours, and then decreased slightly. WBCs began to increase 4 hours after infection due to influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. 67Ga localized in infected chambers before the increase in WBCs. Use of the subcutaneous chamber model could help elucidate the mechanism(s) of 67Ga accumulation at sites of inflammation.
TI  - Activity changes of inorganic pyrophosphatase of Streptococcus faecalis during batch culture.
AB  - The state of inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 was studied in different phases of batch culture. The degree of inactivation (i.e. the ratio of activities observed before and after incubation at 37 degrees C without cysteine) was highest, and the degree of activation (i.e. the ratio of activities after and before incubation in the presence of cysteine) was lowest, in samples taken during the early-exponential growth phase. During the various phases of batch culture, the specific activity before incubation and the degree of inactivation changed in parallel, whereas the specific activity observed after incubation remained nearly constant. During the early-exponential phase of growth almost all the enzyme was in the high-activity form, whereas during the stationary phase the highly active and the less active forms existed in equal amounts. These findings suggest that inorganic pyrophosphatase in S. faecalis is synthesized constitutively and is primarily regulated at the level of activity.
TI  - Purification and some properties of inorganic pyrophosphatase from Streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  - Inorganic pyrophosphatase [EC 3.6.1.1] from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 was  purified to homogeneity as judged by slab gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The purification consisted of the following steps: streptomycin sulfate precipitation, (NH4)2SO4 treatment in a Sepharose CL-4B column, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography, gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34, and preparative slab gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34 was used to determine the molecular weight and slab gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate to study the subunit molecular weight. The enzyme appeared to be composed of four subunits with molecular weights of approximately 32,500. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was about 128,000. The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate, and no activity was found with a variety of other phosphate esters. The cation Mg2+ was required for maximum activity; Co2+ and Ca2+ supported 24% and 5.6% of the activity observed with Mg2+, respectively. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid inhibited the reductants containing SH-groups activated the enzyme suggesting that lysine and cysteine have essential roles in the enzyme.
TI  - Streptococcal infections in pregnancy. A study of 48 bacteremias.
AB  - During a 4-year period, 48 obstetric patients with aerobic streptococcal bacteremia were identified. The isolates were group B (31); group D, enterococci (5); group A (4); group D, not enterococci (3); Streptococcus pneumoniae (3); and viridans streptococci (2). The most common diagnoses were endometritis (36) and chorioamnionitis (8). For all streptococcal genital infections, the clinical presentation included early-onset fever, often with few localizing signs. Only one patient had a chronic debilitating disease. There was an excellent correlation between genital and bloodstream isolates (36 of 42). Maternal response to therapy was good, with no deaths nor episodes of septic shock. Possible infectious complications developed in two fetuses and four neonates. The microbiologic and clinical features of aerobic streptococci were reviewed, and the outcome in obstetric patients and that in other adults were compared.
TI  - Factors affecting sperm motility. VI. Sperm viability under the influence of bacterial growth in human ejaculates.
AB  - The influence of bacterial growth on human sperm motility and viability was evaluated objectively with the multiple-exposure photography method. Experimental semen specimens, obtained from normal donors bh nonaseptic means of masturbation, were incubated with antibiotics at room temperature or body temperature for 24 hours. Although bacteria, grew in control specimens, were totally eradicated in all antibiotic-treated specimens, no significant difference was found between these groups with regard to sperm motility throughout the time of incubation. Sperm survival was not inhibited, nor was it extended as a result of suppression of bacterial growth. In both groups, survival time was much shorter in specimens incubated at body temperature than in those kept at room temperature. Sperm motility was not affected after 2 hours of incubation of fresh specimens with concentrations of various pathogenic bacteria similar to those found in severe prostatitis. The question of whether the use of antibiotics in the treatment of asthenospermia per se has a prognostic value is discussed.
TI  - Streptococcus bovis meningitis and carcinoma of the colon.
AB  - A 90-year-old woman who presented with Streptococcus bovis meningitis was found at autopsy to have a colonic carcinoma. Although the association between colonic carcinoma and S. bovis endocarditis or bacteremia is well-documented in the literature, S. bovis meningitis is uncommon. A thorough investigation of the gastrointestinal tract should be undertaken in patients with S. bovis infections even in the absence of gastrointestinal signs or symptoms.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes to N-Formimidoyl thienamycin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 12 strains of enterococci and 10 stains of Listeria monocytogenes to N-formimidoyl thienamycin were determined by a standard broth dilution method. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for L. monocytogenes strains were less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. As a group, strains of Streptococcus faecium were less susceptible than Streptococcus faecalis strains, but even for the latter, the minimal inhibitory concentrations were slightly greater than those previously reported. Minimal bactericidal concentrations against all organisms were many-fold higher than the corresponding inhibitory concentrations. In time-kill studies, combinations of N-formimidoyl thienamycin with gentamicin were synergistic against (or they completely sterilized cultures of) all the enterococcal strains and nine to 10 strains of L. monocytogenes. The magnitude of killing by the combinations was comparable to that previously observed with penicillin-gentamicin combinations. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin-tobramycin combinations were synergistic against those strains of S. faecalis and L. monocytogenes tested, but not against those of S. faecium.
TI  - Nucleoid structure in freeze fractures of Streptococcus faecalis: effects of filtration and chilling.
AB  - With the techniques used in this study, the nucleoid of Streptococcus faecalis could not be seen in freeze-etch preparations unless glutaraldehyde had been added to cultures of cells before they were frozen. With time, the nucleoid became visible as a network of fibers, apparently as a result of the aggregation of individual chromosomal elements in the presence of glutaraldehyde. When glutaraldehyde was added to undisturbed cultures, the fibers that became visible were observed in small patches that were seemingly scattered throughout the cytoplasm. However, if cells were chilled or placed on filters before glutaraldehyde was added, the fibers which then developed were seen in large central areas. The appearance of centralized nucleoids in freeze fractures of cells that had been chilled or filtered could be correlated with a decrease in the central density of the cytoplasm, as seen by light microscopy, in cells embedded in gelatin or bovine serum albumin. These observations are discussed in relation to a model for the normal structure of the nucleoid which suggests that the treatments routinely used to study the morphology-physiology of cells (chilling, filtration, and fixation) result in a reorganization of the cytoplasm, leading to an increase in the centralization of nuclear material.
TI  - Effect of cerulenin on cellular autolytic activity and lipid metabolism during inhibition of protein synthesis in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Cellular autolytic activity as well as lipid and lipoteichoic acid metabolism have been studied in cultures of Streptococcus faecalis receiving various combinations of the following treatments: chloramphenicol addition, starvation for an essential amino acid (valine), and cerulenin treatment. Lipoteichoic acid initially accumulated in chloramphenicol-treated and amino acid-starved cells and decreased relative to the cellular mass in cerulenin-treated cells. The relative phosphatidylglycerol content of amino acid-starved cultures or of cultures treated with either antibiotic rapidly decreased upon initiation of each treatment. In all cases, cerulenin initially stimulated diphosphatidylglycerol synthesis. Pretreatment of cultures with cerulenin prevented the inhibition of cellular synthesis autolysis normally observed during chloramphenicol treatment, but did not affect amino acid starvation-induced inhibition of autolytic activity. Variations in the levels of the nonionic lipid fraction, predominantly diglycerides, correlated best with the patterns of autolytic activity observed during chloramphenicol treatment, whereas variations in the levels of diphosphatidylglycerol and lipoteichoic acid correlated best with the patterns of autolytic activity observed during amino acid starvation. Components of the nonionic lipid fraction were demonstrated to inhibit autolytic activity 50% in whole cell and in cell wall assays at 60 and 120 nmol/mg (dry weight), respectively.
TI  - Active transport of Ca2+ in bacteria: bioenergetics and function.
AB  - The bioenergetics of Ca2+ transport in bacteria are discussed with special emphasis on the interrelationship between transport and other cellular functions such as substrate oxidation by the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. The unusual polarity of Ca2+ movement provides an exceptional tool to compare active transport and other ATP requiring or generating processes since this ion is actively taken up by everted vesicles in which the coupling-factor ATPase is exposed to the external medium. As inferred from studies with everted vesicles, the active extrusion of Ca2+ by whole cells can be accomplished by substrate driven respiration, hydrolysis of ATP or as in the case of Streptococcus faecalis by a nonhydrolytic unknown process which involves ATP directly. Substrate oxidation and the hydrolysis of ATP result in the generation of a pH gradient which can energize the Ca2+ uptake directly (Ca2+/H+ antiport) or via a secondary Na+ gradient (Ca2+/Na+ antiport). In contrast to exponentially growing cells sporulating Bacilli accumulate Ca2+ during the synthesis of dipicolinic acid. Studies involving Ca2+ transport provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that the Mg2+ ATPase from Escherichia coli not only provides the driving force for various cellular functions but exerts a regulatory role by controlling the permeability of the membrane to protons. The different specificity requirements of various naphthoquinone analogs in the restoration of transport or oxidative phosphorylation, after the natural menaquinone has been destroyed by irradiation, has indicated that a protonmotive force is sufficient to drive active transport. However, in addition to the driving force (protonmotive force) necessary to establish oxidative phosphorylation, a specific spatial orientation of the respiratory components, such as the naphthoquinones, is essential for the utilization of the proton gradient or membrane potential or both. Finally, evidence suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ levels might play a fundamental role in bacterial homeostasis is discussed, in particular the role of Ca2+ in the process of chemotaxis and in conferring bacteria heat stability. A vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction has been found in Escherichia coli which is similar to that reported in mammalian systems which results in gamma carboxylation of glutamate residues. Although all of the proteins containing gamma-carboxyglutamate described so far are involved in Ca2+ metabolism, the role of these proteins in Escherichia coli is unknown and remains to be elucidated.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotic synergism in Streptococcus faecalis: further studies with amikacin and with a new amikacin derivative, 4'-deoxy, 6'-N-methylamikacin.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strains may resist penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy by the production of plasmid-mediated aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. One of these enzymes, aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, has been shown to have a broad range of substrate specificity, including amikacin. We have studied a derivative of amikacin, 4'-deoxy, 6'-N-methylamikacin (BB-K311), against 11 clinical blood isolates of S. faecalis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of BB-K311 were quite similar to those of amikacin, ranging from 125 to 1,000 micrograms/ml. In assays for antibiotic synergy, penicillin and amikacin produced enhanced killing compared with the penicillin alone only against those three strains which lacked the phosphotransferase enzyme. The other eight enzyme-positive strains actually demonstrated significant antagonism between penicillin against all 11 strains, regardless of enzyme production. Analysis of substrate profiles with crude preparations of the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase enzyme confirmed that BB-K311 was a very poor substrate for modification, as expected from the synergy studies. Use of other aminoglycoside analogs confirmed the 3'-OH site of modification. These findings suggest that removing the 4'-OH group in amikacin effectively blocks 3'-phosphorylation by S. faecalis enzyme.

TI  - Gentamicin-thallous-carbonate medium for isolation of fecal streptococci from foods.
AB  - Gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (GTC) agar was formulated by Donnelly and Hartman (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 35:576-581, 1978) to select for fecal streptococci in sewage and water samples. The present study was conducted to determine the usefulness of GTC agar for the enumeration of fecal streptococci in foods. Comparisons were made with KF streptococcal (KF), Pfizer selective enterococcus (PSE), and thallous acetate (TA) agars. Samples of ground beef pork sausage, frozen broccoli, frozen fish, and ice cream were examined. Presumptive streptococcal counts obtained on GTC agar were significantly higher than those obtained on KF and PSE agars and were comparable to those obtained on TA agar. GTC was more sensitive than KF or PSE agars primarily because of the recovery of greater numbers of Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus strains. Percentages of confirmed fecal streptococci obtained on GTC, KF, PSE, and TA agars were 70, 95, 80, and 74, respectively. Differences between these percentages were not statistically significant, but they indicated that selectivity of GTC agar could be improved. Advantages of using GTC agar to isolate fecal streptococci from foods include a short incubation time (16 to 18 h) and large, distinct colonies that facilitate rapid enumeration and subsequent confirmation.
TI  - [Effects of cefotaxime on the intestinal bacterial ecosystem in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime activity was studied in pediatric practice on the intestinal bacteria  flora of 10 children, by means of a differential quantitative method for aerobic and anaerobic faecal flora and was compared to that of 41 controls not receiving any antibiotics. Cefotaxime was given alone in 7 children, and in combination with gentamicin in 3. An effect on the intestinal bacterial flora was noted on E. coli, which disappeared in 4 cases and diminished considerably in 5. A slight increase in Streptococcus D was observed without excessive multiplication of the flora. The study showed no significant alteration for the other aerobic or anaerobic bacilli. There was no selection of resistant organisms. Cefotaxime is a new cephalosporin which does not seem to produce an increase in many resistant pathogens due to a break-down of the barrier effect observed on the bacterial flora of the gut in children.
TI  - [Observations on the fecal streptococcal flora in carnivorous domestic animals (author's transl)].
AB  - From 1200 feces-samples streaks of carnivorous domestic animals (1027 from dogs,  173 from cats) 744 streptococci-strains were isolated and differentiated. 87% proved their, self to be streptococcus group D/enterococcus, 13% falled to 11 others species, much-numerous represented streptococci of Viridans-group (Sc. MG, Sc. milleri, Sc. salivarius, Sc. viridans), Sc. group G (beta-hemolytic biotypes) and Sc. lactis (group N). Among the group D-spezies the most showed species at dogs was Sc. bovis (35%), retinued by Sc. faecium and Sc. durans (ever about 18%) and the both Sc.-faecalis-sub-spezies var. liquefaciens and var. faecalis (ever about 8%). At cats, the relation respecting to group D-shares, especially of Sc. bovis, were strong varying. All together an interesting survey on the qualitative composition of the streptococcal flora in dog- and cat-intestine was obtained.

AB  - Studies were carried out on a total of 75 samples of raw-dried meat products of a compact type--dried beef, Gabrovska Keiser dried meat, pig salted neck, rolled meat Trapezitsa, V. Turnovo delicacy, and Elena fillet, to establish the amount of Staphylococcus bacteria. It was found that the enterococcus titer of this type of meat products varied from 10(-1) to 10(-4), depending on the product. Most strongly contaminated with enterococci proved the pig salted neck. The higher amounts of enterococci in the studied products as well as their higher resistance to the action of unfavourable factors (ph, NaCl, water content) showed their advantage over the coliform bacteria as sanitary-index organisms in raw-dried meat products of a compact type. Various ratios of all species of enterococci were established in these products. Str. faecius was most often found (32.44 per cent), followed by Str. faecalis (26.22 per cent), Str. faecalis var. liquefaciens (16.00 per cent), and Str. durans (12.00 per cent). Str. faecalis var. zymogenes (8.00 per cent) and Str. bovis (5.33 per cent) were isolated less frequently from some of the products only.

TI  - [The subclavian vein catheter related infections (author's transl)].
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to study the possible means to prevent the subclavian vein catheter related infections. The tip of the catheter and the part situating at the skin puncture were cultured using the semiquantitative culture method. The growth of the micro-organisms was divided into three groups: classical pathogenic, opportunistic and non pathogenic. We did not find any growth in 64 p. cent of the catheters. The puncture site gave growth in 15 p. cent, the catheter tip in 6,5 p. cent and both of them in 14 p. cent In this study four cases (1,5 p. cent) of septicemias were found. In these cases Streptococcus fecalis was the most common microorganism. The aim of the semiquantitative culture method was to differentiate a real catheter related infection and contamination. The real infection was found only in 32 catheter tips though growth was seen in 54 catheter tips. According to this investigation it seems that the most important factor in preventing catheter related infections was strict sterility during the catheter placement as well as during the maintenance. A small dose of heparin probably reduces the formation of fibrin sleeve around the catheter tip and thus prevents infections. The time the patient is catheterized is also of importance, patients with catheter related septicemia had twice as long duration than cases without growth of catheter tip.

TI  - [Interest of humoral antibodies assay for diagnosis and survey of urinary tract infections by gram negative bacilli and streptococcus D in children (author's transl)].
AB  - The assay of humoral antibodies during urinary tract infections of children is performed by passive haemagglutination. In gram negative bacilli infections (176 children) the antigens are derived from the patients' bacteria. For streptococcus D infections the antigen is a phenol extract, specifically tested and used for all streptococcus D urinary tract infections (40 children). The humoral antibodies assay is of first interest to distinguish between high urinary tract infections with renal parenchym bacterial involvement and low urinary tract infections. In high urinary tract infections the antibodies are significantly elevated and almost surely indicate renal infection for a 1/2 560 titre; they raise both in gram negative bacteria and in streptococcus D infections. There is however a difference in a rather higher number of cases of streptococcus D infections where it is impossible of connect high sera titres and clinical symptoms of pyelonephritis, contrary to gram negative bacilli infections. It seems to be due to aetiological differences in urinary tract infections by streptococcus D, which are more often secondary infections, during severe urologic diseases. In such cases the symptomatology of infections is less typical than in E. Coli urinary tract infections. Another interest is the capacity of survey by this method. Three kinds of courses of antibody titres are observed: the first is a clean break of titre lower than 1/160 after three months; the second is the continuance of the same high levels over three months; the third is continuance of high significative level after a first incomplete fall. In the last two cases it is highly probable that a pyelonephritis processes is engaged. This may be useful for treatment and survey of children with urologic diseases.
TI  - Combination effect with some aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - Strains of resistant species -- Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis  -- isolated from material of nosocomial infections in the surgical department of a Prague hospital were tested for combined effect with further chemotherapeutics. The same concerned Ps, aeruginosa noted, at present, by a high degree of resistance. In Ps. aeruginosa it was the combination sisomicin-carfecillin that proved a success in 50 p. c. of cases as well as that of sisomicin-doxycyclin. At the same time the authors draw attention to the possibility of antagonistic action of the combination sisomicin-chloramphenicol in a third part of the strains tested. Potentiation of the effect in Staphylococcus aureus strains was observed also in the combination sisomicin-carfecillin in more than one half of the strains tested and in case of sisomicin-doxycyclin in one third of the strains. In Streptococcus faecalis strains sisomicin was combined with amoxycillin, carbenicillin, carfecillin and doxycyclin; synergistic action being observed with all those combinations in more than one half of strains tested. No antagonism was registered in those cases. (Ta.).
TI  - In situ and laboratory studies of bacterial survival using a microporous membrane sandwich.
AB  - A new device and procedure for the study of bacterial survival in an aquatic environment are described. The device uses two appressed presterilized microporous membranes to expose a bacterial cell suspension to the environment at a cell concentration that closely resembles those levels found in natural aquatic ecosystems. The device has been used under laboratory controlled conditions and in situ to study and compare bacterial survival times. In laboratory studies, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis survived the longest at 12 degrees C, pH 5, and in the presence of iron or calcium ions and cysteine. Cells in mid-stationary growth phase survived longer than those in mid- or late-logarithmic phase, whereas those maintained for a year or more as stock cultures survived for shorter period of time than did recent environmental isolates. In situ studies indicate that 5% of the starting number of E. coli and S. faecalis cells may survive longer than 96 h at 16 degrees C in potable lake water, whereas survival times in polluted lake water were approximately 12 h.
TI  - Choriogonadotropin-like antigen in a strain of Streptococcus faecalis and a strain of Staphylococcus simulans: detection, identification, and characterization.
AB  - The presence of choriogonadotropin- and alpha-subunit-like materials in two species of bacteria identified as Staphylococcus simulans and Streptococcus faecalis have been demonstrated by the indirect fluorescein-labeled and the indirect peroxidase-labeled immunocytochemical techniques, utilizing antiserum for human choriogonadotropin, for its alpha and beta-subunits and the bera-subunit COOH-terminal peptide. The bacteria were originally isolated from the urine of two patients with advanced forms of cancer. Chromatography done on the water-soluble extract of acetone powder preparations of the bacterial cultures revealed the presence of a material similar to the complete trophoblastic hormone and to its beta-subunit in the culture media of S. simulans, and to the beta-subunit in the media of S. faecalis. No free alpha-subunit was detectable. Furthermore, the choriogonadotropin-like factor demonstrated biological activity in in vivo assay systems. From the present results, it can be concluded that some species of "cancer-associated" bacteria can synthesize a human trophoblastic hormone-like glycoprotein with physicochemical properties similar to those of the human trophoblastic hormone that is biologically active and that is either released complete or as one of its subunits in the culture media.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of methylglyoxal produced by heated cells of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus faecalis that survived heating for 21 min at 60 degrees C  were killed when resuspended at an initial cell density of about 1 X 10(8) viable units/mL and incubated at 33 degrees C for 24 h in a no-growth medium containing potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, glucose, and casein hydrolysate. When such heated cells were resuspended at an initial cell density of about 1 X 10(7) viable units/mL or lower, subsequent cell death was reduced at least 10 000-fold. Unheated cells incubated under similar conditions at about 1 X 10(8) and 1 X 10(9) viable units/mL did not die. Cell death was due to a toxic compound synthesized by the heated cells, and supernatants from incubations showing a bactericidal effect contained a component, absent in nonlethal supernatants, that reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometer analysis, and the visible spectrum of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative of the unknown and authentic methylglyoxal, and the positive response shown by the free unknown compound when used as a substrate for glyoxalase I, suggested that methylglyoxal was the bactericidal compound. Solutions of authentic methylglyoxal were bactericidal at concentrations above 0.2 mM and lethal supernatants contained about 1 mM methylglyoxal, whereas supernatants that were not lethal contained less than 0.02 mM methylglyoxal.
TI  - Methodological variation in antibiotic synergy tests against enterococci.
AB  - Thirty-two human isolates of enterococci were tested for antibiotic synergy by using penicillin and one of six aminoglycosides. Three methods were used: synergy screen, microdilution checkerboard, and time-kill curves. The synergy screen accurately predicted synergy for gentamicin-penicillin combinations, and this synergy was later confirmed by time-kill curves. The microdilution checkerboard method suffered from inherent variation, and agreement with time-kill curves ranged from 92% (twofold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration) to 4.2% (fourfold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentration). We suggest that enterococci be screened for synergy (i.e., presence or absence of high-level resistance) by using the criterion of growth or no growth in the presence of 2,000 microgram of an aminoglycoside per ml. The microdilution checkerboard test for synergy is not recommended.

Its uptake by bacterial cells was Langmuirian, and it caused loss of intracellular material. Aerobic glucose metabolism and dehydrogenase activity were inhibited. Low concentrations of the drug affected the membrane-bound ATPase and K transport in Streptococcus faecalis.

AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strain DS16 harbors the conjugative hemolysin-bacteriocin  plasmid pAD1 (35 megadaltons) and the nonconjugative R-plasmid pAD2 determining resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and erythromycin; a tetracycline resistance (Tetr) determinant is located on the chromosome. When strain DS16 was mated (on membrane filters) with the plasmid-free strain JH2-2, Tetr transconjugants could be obtained at a frequency of about 10(-6) per recipient. Analyses of transconjugants showed that some contained the Tetr determinant linked to pAD1. Subsequent studies showed that the Tetr determinant was located on a 10-megaldalton transposon, designated Tn916, which could insert into two hemolysin plasmids: pAM gamma 1 and pOB1. In addition, derivatives of DS16 devoid of pAD1 were capable of transferring Tetr to recipient strains. Transconjugants (plasmid-free) from such matings could subsequently act as donors in the transfer of Tetr. Both transposition and transfer were found to be rec independent.
TI  - Reversible changes in the activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase of Streptococcus  faecalis. The effect of compounds containing SH-groups.
AB  - The activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 decreased rapidly, when the cell extracts prepared by lysozyme and osmotic shock were incubated in a buffer solution (pH 8.0) at 25-50 degrees C. Increase in pH (from 8.5 to 10.5) retarded the inactivation considerably. The low activity level was reached in 2.5 h at 37 degrees C (pH 8.0) and this residual activity was stable during prolonged incubation. The enzyme in the form of low activity was not rapidly denatured until at 70 degrees C. The inactivation could be prevented and reversed by cysteine, dithiotreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol, but reductants, which do not contain SH-groups were not effective. Reduced glutathione slowed down and oxidized glutathione stimulated the inactivation. With pure enzyme it was shown that the low, stable activity level obtained with crude extracts during incubation is a property of inorganic pyrophosphatase and not due to another enzyme with a low capacity to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate. These findings suggest that inorganic pyrophosphatase form S. faecalis exists in two interconvertible forms which differ in activity.

AB  
TI  - ATP-linked sodium transport in Streptococcus faecalis. I. The sodium circulation.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis, like other bacteria, expels Na+ and accumulates K+. Sodium movements in several bacterial species have been attributed to secondary antiport of Na+ for H+, energized by the proton-motive force. We find a more complex pattern: a circulation of Na+ across the plasma membrane. One limb is the diffusion of Na+, into the cells or out, by a low affinity pathway in response to gradients of concentration and of electrical potential; Na+ movements are enhanced in metabolizing cells. The other limb is the vectorial extrusion of Na+ by a transport system that requires "ATP" (either ATP itself or a related metabolite), even when Na+ is moving downhill. Cells glycolyzing at alkaline pH in buffer containing excess K+ can expel Na+ against a concentration gradient of 100-fold, even in the presence of reagents that block or short circuit the proton circulation (pH gradient and membrane potential both zero). Evidently, under these conditions "ATP" can serve as the energy donor for a primary sodium pump. However, at acid pH, or in presence of low levels of K+, sodium extrusion requires both "ATP" and the proton-motive force. A mutant is described that retains the leak pathway but lacks the "ATP"-linked transport system.
TI  - The effect of haematin and catalase on Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes growing on glycerol.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was grown aerobically on a complex medium containing glycerol as the carbon source. Addition of hematin or bovine liver catalase to the growth medium resulted in a small increment in growth yield. Suspensions of bacteria that had been grown in the presence of haematin or catalase, respectively, translocated 0.83 to 1.98 and 1.33 to 2.53 protons per oxygen atom consumed in glycerol oxidation. Bacterial grown without haematin or catalase had nil or little respiratory-induced proton translocation during glycerol oxidation. Inclusion of haematin in the growth medium caused the bacterium to form a cyanide- and azide-sensitive catalase. Superoxide dismutase activity was similar whether or not haematin was added to the growth medium.

TI  - Binding of beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis: relation to antibacterial activity.
AB  - The binding of 14 structurally diverse beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was studied, and the results were examined in the context of the antibacterial activity of the compounds. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 87,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 75,000) of S. aureus and penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 105,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 79,000) of S. faecalis bound beta-lactam antibiotics at concentrations comparable to minimum inhibitory concentrations and might therefore be essential. The low affinity of S. faecalis penicillin-binding proteins, relative to that of S. aureus penicillin-binding proteins, toward most beta-lactam antibiotics is probably responsible for the resistance of the former organism to most of these compounds.
TI  - [Reducing activity and differential thermal analysis of enterococci].
AB  - The reducing activity of 100 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 100 Streptococcus faecium strains and 100 enterococcal strains were studied by the quantitative method. The study revealed that all mobile enterococci, in contrast to S. faecium, reduce 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride with the formation of triphenylformasan. Differential thermal analysis also indicated that S. faecalis, S. faecium and mobile enterococci had thermograms with definite mathematical characteristics and could be best differentiated by the indices of their form and the size of S3 areas. The quantitative methods of the investigation of reducing activity and differential thermal analysis can be used for the differentiation of enterococcal species. Mobile enterococci have definite characteristics allowing one to sharply differentiate them from S. faecium and S. faecalis.

TI  - Identification of the lethal target of benzylpenicillin in Streptococcus faecalis by in vivo penicillin binding studies.
AB  - The mode of bacterial killing by penicillins is still unknown in spite of many studies on the subject. The recent finding of multiple penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in sensitive bacteria and the possibility of analysing the binding of the antibiotic to exponentially growing cells have provided new directions for investigating this problem. Sensitivity to lethal and other effects of penicillin varies very significantly with the conditions of growth of the cells. If PBPs were the penicillin target, changes in conditions of growth causing variations in penicillin sensitivity should be accompanied by changes in these proteins. Furthermore, if one of PBPs could be identified as the killing target, it could possibly be demonstrated to show changes in cells growing in different conditions. We show here that in Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 changes in conditions of growth are accompanied by changes in PBPs. Furthermore, in the presence of the minimal dose of 14C-benzylpenicillin causing complete inhibition of cell growth, 100% of the total radioactivity is bound to a single protein (PBP 3).
TI  - The penicillin-binding proteins in Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 possesses seven membrane-bound penicillin-binding proteins. They have been characterized with respect to their apparent molecular weights, relative abundance, specificity profiles for 15 different beta-lactam antibiotics and stability under various conditions. In water and at 37 degrees C, all the native penicillin-binding proteins have half-lives longer than 20 h except protein 3b (half-life of about 600 min) and protein 4 (half-life of about 175 min). The short-lived 80 000-Mr protein 4 is spontaneously converted into a 73 000-Mr water-soluble, penicillin-binding protein 4. Similarly, the short-lived 82 000-Mr protein 3b seems to be the protein from which the 72 000-Mr water-soluble protein X spontaneously originates during incubation of the membranes. Release of both proteins 4 and X from the membrane is maximal under alkaline conditions; it is not inhibited by various protease inhibitors. After exposure to trypsin, the 43 000-Mr membrane-bound penicillin binding protein 6 (a DD-carboxypeptidase) gives to a 30 000-Mr water-soluble protein 6. Like the parent protein, protein 6 exhibits both DD-carboxypeptidase activity and penicillin-binding ability. With proteins 6 and 6, low dose levels of p-chloromercuribenzoate prevent both enzyme activity and combination with penicillin, thus strongly suggesting that a thiol group is involved in the enzyme active center. We have shown previously [Coyette et al. in Eur. J. Biochem. 88, 297--305 (1978) and 75, 231--239 (1977)] that the DD-carboxypeptidase protein 6 fragments the benzylpenicillin molecule with formation of phenylacetylglycine. Breakdown of the complex formed between [14C]benzylpenicillin and 14 000-Mr membrane-bound protein 1 is also 'enzyme-catalysed'. Most likely, however, the released product is penicilloate. With all the other penicillin-binding proteins whose molecular weights are intermediate between those of proteins 1 and 6, breakdown of the complexes formed with [14C]benzylpenicillin results from proteolysis and is not due to the release of the bound metabolite. None of the penicillin-binding proteins behaves, by itself, as a lethal target for beta-lactam antibiotic action on the living cells.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis mutants defective in regulation of cytoplasmic pH.
AB  - We have isolated two acid-sensitive mutants of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790), designated AS13 and AS25, which grew at pH 7.5 but not at pH below 6.0. The ionophore gramicidin D, which collapsed the pH gradient between the cytoplasm and the medium, had little effect on the growth of these mutants, indicating that growing cells maintain only a small pH gradient. In the presence of gramicidin D the growth rates of the parent and mutant strains were identical over a range of pH values. When glucose was added to a cell suspension at pH 6.4, the parent strain generated a pH gradient of 1.0 unit, interior alkaline; AS13 generated a pH gradient of only 0.5 units, and AS25 generated no measurable pH gradient. The proton permeability of the mutant strains was the same as that of the parent strain. These results suggest that a cytoplasmic pH of around 7.5 is required for the growth of the cells and that the mutant strains are unable to establish a neutral cytoplasmic pH in acidic medium because of damage to the regulatory system of the cytoplasmic pH. Mutant strains also have a reduced capacity to extrude protons and take up potassium. Therefore, it is likely that these cation transport systems are involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH.
TI  - A novel method for the determination of electrical potentials across cellular membranes. II. Membrane potentials of Acholeplasmas, Mycoplasmas, Streptococci and erythrocytes.
AB  - The membrane potentials of Acholeplasma laidlawii, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Streptococcus faecalis and human erythrocytes have been determined by applying a novel technique. The membrane potentials were calculated simply from potassium concentrations determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and gravimetry. The versatility of the new technique is demonstrated by comparing our results with data obtained by different techniques.
TI  - The essential sulfhydryl group of ornithine transcarbamylases. pH dependence of the spectra of its 2-mercuri-4-nitrophenol derivative.
AB  - The essential sulfhydryl group of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltransferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver and Streptococcus faecalis reacts preferentially with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol. The spectra of this derivative between pH 4.4 AND 8.8 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED INto the spectrum of the nitrophenolate ion (III) and two species of phenol (I and II). The lambda max of I and II (both enzymes) and III (bovine) are red shifted from those of the comparable species in the same derivative of 2-mercaptoethanol. Deprotonation of a residue on the enzyme must be responsible for the transition from I to II. The pK values of the phenolic group are 7.1 (mercaptoethanol), 7.7 (bovine), and 8.8 (S. faecalis). The red shift in the lambda max of III and the modest increase in the pK of the phenolic group are consistent with a relatively hydrophobic environment for the nitrophenolate ion in the bovine enzyme. Since deprotonation of the residue in the bovine enzyme perturbs the pK of the phenolic group only slightly, its effect may be indirect. Interaction with a neighboring carboxyl group (pK 5.3) would account for the large increase in the pK of the phenolic group in the S. faecalis enzyme, which is not accompanied by an appreciable shift in the lambda max. Carbamyl-P increases the pK of the phenolic group in both enzymes, a result consistent with its binding site being close to the essential sulfhydryl group.
TI  - The essential sulfhydryl group of ornithine transcarbamylases. Reaction with anionic, aromatic disulfides and properties of its cyano derivative.
AB  - The essential sulfhydryl group of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltrasferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver and Streptococcus faecalis reacts slowly with aromatic disulfides at alkaline pH. But at pH 4.5, the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction of this group in the S. faecalis enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Nbs2) is 40-fold that for the reaction of 2-mercaptoethanol. This enhanced reactivity at acid pH, because it occurs only with anionic, aromatic disulfides and results in rates greater than those for low molecular weight thiols, must be due to a specific interaction with these reagents. The Nbs derivatives of both enzymes are inactive; the cyano derivatives prepared from them by cyanolysis are active but with greatly increased Kmorn. The slow rates of cyanolysis and thiolysis suggest that access to the Nbs residue is limited. Also, the red shift of the spectrum of the Nbs residue in the enzymes from that of Nbs2 implies that its microenvironment is different from that of the bulk medium. Deprotonation of a residue in the S. faecalis enzyme causes a further red shift. Since even the small, uncharged cyano group interferes with the binding of ornithine to both enzymes, the essential sulfhydryl group may actually be a part of the binding site for ornithine.
TI  - Ornithine transcarbamylases. Ordering of S-cyano peptides and location of characteristically reactive cysteinyl residues within the sequence.
AB  - The peptides produced by cleavage of the S-cyano derivatives of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltransferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver, Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 11,420, and Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043 have been isolated and aligned. Their amino acid compositions and COOH-terminal sequences are reported. The COOH-terminal peptide (51 residues in the bovine enzyme; 66 residues in the bacterial enzymes) contains the essential sulfhydryl group.

TI  - Morphological effect of cerulenin treatment on Streptococcus faecalis as studied  by ultrastructure reconstruction.
AB  - Exponential-phase cells of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were treated with a concentration of cerulenin (5 micrograms/ml) that has been shown to block both lipoteichoic acid and lipid synthesis and cell division within 10 min. The morphological effect of this treatment was studied by making three-dimensional reconstructions of cells based on measurements taken from axial thin sections. This analysis indicated that cerulenin interferes with cell division by inhibiting normal constriction of the division furrow and centripetal growth of the cross wall in envelope growth sites. Rather than dividing, many of the sites in treated cells apparently continue to elongate and produce abnormally large amounts of peripheral wall surface. These observations were interpreted in terms of a previously proposed model in which cerulenin would prevent the synthesis of a lipid-containing inhibitor of autolytic enzyme activity needed for division. In addition, measurements showed that the average number of envelope growth sites per cell increased during treatment, suggesting that although cerulenin treatment blocks division, it does not interfere with the formation of new envelope growth sites. It was also observed that the size and frequency of mesosomes did not decline during the 60-min period of drug treatment. This tends to decrease the likelihood that mesosomes are formed from a pool of intracellular membrane precursors that would be depleted during a period of restricted lipid biosynthesis.
TI  - Recombination-deficient mutant of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - An ultraviolet radiation-sensitive derivative of Streptococcus faecalis strain JH2-2 was isolated and found to be deficient in recombination, using a plasmid-plasmid recombination system. The strain was sensitive to chemical agents which interact with deoxyribonucleic acid and also underwent deoxyribonucleic acid degradation after ultraviolet irradiation. Thus, the mutant has properties similar to those of recA strains of Escherichia coli.

TI  - Bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. Previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% H2O2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). Survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of H2O2 (0.6 to 0.01%) were constructed. Organisms with high cellular catalase activity (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% H2O2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. The efficacy of H2O2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation with bacterial suspensions. H2O2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of H2O2 into urinary drainage bags may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

TI  - Plasmid-mediated resistance to aminocyclitol antibiotics in group D streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis BM4100 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin, kanamycin, and structurally related antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to aminocyclitols in this strain were carried by a plasmid, pIP800, self-transferable to other S. faecalis strains. The aminocyclitol resistance was mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase and acetyltransferase activities. It was inferred that phosphorylation occurred at the 2"-hydroxyl group and that acetylation occurred at the 6'-hydroxyl group of the aminocyclitols. The enzyme activities were not separable by gel filtration or by isoelectric focusing. Their apparent molecular weight was 31,000, and their isoelectric point was 5.3. With respect to substrate profile, size, and charge, the transferases from strain BM4100 resembled closely those with identical site specificity described in staphylococci. These results suggest that plasmid gene transfer may occur between the two pathogenic bacterial genera.

AB  - Hemolytic and nonhemolytic strains of Streptococcus faecalis, together with some  strains of oral and vaginal alpha-hemolytic streptococci, produced one or more factors that inhibited the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and a variety of other vaginal bacteria. Some streptococci were inhibitory to indicator organisms only in the presence of catalase, whereas catalase either enhanced or prevented inhibitory action for still other streptococci. The inhibitors produced by certain streptococci resembled enterococcal bacteriocins, which have not previously been found to inhibit G. vaginalis or N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - [Coupling of energy-dependent H+ and K+ ion fluxes in Streptococcus faecalis].
AB  - Grampositive bacteria S. faecalis are capable of uptaking potassium ions during many hours in the media containing glucose. Such behaviour of K+-uptake indicates that this system is not regulated as it takes place in gramnegative bacteria E. coli (1,3). The stoichimetry of DCCD-sensitive exchange between H+ and K+ ions equals 2:1. It is possible that S. faecalis possesses an electrogenic proton-potassium pump which can exchange 2H+ from the cell for external K+.
TI  - Unit cell hypothesis for Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The mass doubling times of exponential-phase cultures of Streptococcus faecalis were varied from 30 to 110 min by omitting glutamine from a defined growth medium and providing different concentrations of glutamate (ranging from 300 to 14 mug/ml). After Formalin fixation, cells were dried by the critical point method, and carbon-platinum replicas were prepared. The surface area and volume of cell poles seen in these replicas were estimated by a computer-assisted, three-dimensional reconstruction technique. It was found that the amount of surface area and volume of poles seen in these replicas were independent of the growth rate of culture from which the samples were taken. These observations were consistent with the unit cell model hypothesis of Donachie and Begg, in which a small number of surface sites would produce a constant amount of new cell surface regardless of the mass doubling time of the culture. However, measurements of the thickness of the cell wall taken from thin sections of the same cells showed that the cell wall increased in thickness as a function of the increase in cellular peptidoglycan content which occurs when the growth rate of this organism is slowed down by a decrease in glutamate concentration. Thus, it would seem that although the size of polar shells made by S. faecalis is invariant with growth rate, the amount of wall precursors used to construct these shells is not.

TI  - The biosynthesis of nascent membrane lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) from phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol.
AB  - Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol functions as the acceptor of sn-glycerol 1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol in the in vitro synthesis of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790). The enzyme catalyzing this polymer-forming reaction is membrane-bound. The majority of the product is water-soluble, is excluded from Sepharose 6B, and, after longer incubations, changes to a form that co-precipitates with protein upon exposure to a denaturing agent. These properties are shared by the polyglycerol phosphate-containing membrane lipoteichoic acid isolated from whole cells of S. faecium. However, unlike the lipoteichoic acid generated in vivo, the glycerol phosphate polymer portion of the product synthesized in vitro is not substituted and, therefore, is considered a nascent lipoteichoic acid intermediate.
TI  - Evidence of thermonuclease production by Bacillus spp. and enterococci in naturally contaminated cheese.
AB  - Of 105 thermonuclease-positive (TNase-positive) cheese samples comprising 13 types, 92 (87.6%) contained coagulase-positive staphylococci, whereas 9 (8.6%) contained microorganisms other than staphylococci as the major contaminants. Of the latter group, six samples contained Bacillus spp. comprising three species (B. cereus, B. licheniformis, and B. subtilis), and three contained mainly enterococci (Streptococcus faecalis), which were proven to be TNase producers. The organisms responsible for TNase production in the other four samples (3.8%) are not known, because isolates from these samples failed to produce the enzyme. Unlike staphylococcal TNase, a greater part of nonstaphylococcal TNase remains in the cheese homogenate after extraction of the enzyme at pH 3.8 instead of pH 4.5.
TI  - Bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  - We investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (CF) on 14C-labeled Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and on whole dental plaque. CF was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. CF supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from Streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the CF supernate. The findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. On the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed CF pellet were inactive. Further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by CF from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The role of bacteriolytic factors, present in CF, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.
TI  - The dose at which neomycin and polymyxin B can be applied for selective decontamination of the digestive tract in mice.
AB  - Oral treatment of mice with various doses of neomycin or polymyxin B was performed in order to determine which dose caused substantial suppression of aerobic gram-negative rods. In addition the effect of the various doses on Streptococcus faecalis and on other factors of the colonization resistance (CR) of the digestive tract were studied. It was found that polymyxin B was effective in suppressing sensitive gram-negative bacteria following daily doses of 3.2 mg/mouse, and that even extremely high daily doses of 9.7 mg/mouse did not affect the CR. Neomycin was effective in suppressing Enterobacteriaceae species following oral daily doses of 5.4 mg/mouse. With this dose, however, the CR was somewhat decreased which was also evidenced by the increased concentration of beta-aspartylglycine in the faeces and the increased size (weight) of the caecum in these animals. Suppression of Str. faecalis was seen from doses of 24 mg/mouse on.
TI  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate-dependent biosynthesis of ribothymidine in transfer RNA of Streptococcus faecalis. Evidence for reduction of the 1-carbon unit by FADH2.
AB  - The methyl carbon of ribothymidine in Loop IV of the tRNA of Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and some other microorganisms is derived directly from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, not S-adenosylmethionine. The pure enzyme from S. faecalis also requires FADH2. We have obtained evidence that tetrahydrofolate is a product of the reaction and demonstrated that label from [5-3H]5-deazaFMNH2 is incorporated into the methyl moiety of ribothymidine. These data indicate that the enzyme uses methylenetetrahydrofolate solely as a 1-carbon donor and employs FADH2 as a reducing agent in vitro according to the following reaction: tRNA(U psi C) + CH2 = THF + FADH2 leads to tRNA(T psi C) + THF + FAD.

Culture determination of the acquisition of antibacterial properties by the treated specimens immediately and 1 week after the treatment was evaluated using the test organism Streptococcus faecalis. It was concluded that chlorhexidine is a potent antibacterial agent under the test conditions and that its use as an endodontic irrigating solution should be further evaluated.

TI  - Bacterial inhibitory effects of nitrite: inhibition of active transport, but not  of group translocation, and of intracellular enzymes.
AB  - Nitrite inhibited active transport of proline in Escherichia coli but not group translocation of sugar via the phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system. These results were consistent with previous results that nitrite inhibits active transport, oxygen uptake, and oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic bacteria. Nitrite also inhibited aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) from E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, and rabbit muscle. Thus, these various data showed that nitrite has more than one site of attack in the bacterial cell. These data also indicated that nitrite is inhibitory to a wide range of physiological types of bacteria.

AB  - Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was adapted to grow at pressures as high as 1000 atm (1 atm = 101.325 kPa) at 37 degrees C by gradually increasing the growth pressure for agar stab subcultures in steps of 50 atm from 750 atm, the maximum growth pressure for unadapted cultures. A stable variant with enhanced barotolerance designated APR-11 was characterized. Similar variants could be obtained repeatedly from S. faecalis cultures by following the indicated procedure, APR-11 was able to grow in liquid media at pressures some 200 atm greater than the maximum for the parent. It appeared to have a regulatory defect in the arginine dihydrolase system and produced ammonia during glycolysis even in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. The ammonia acted to neutralize metabolic acids and to confer a type of acid tolerance. This acid tolerance may be involved in barotolerance since pressure is known to render S. faecalis hypersensitive to acid conditions. In all, it appeared that pressure can be used as a selection agent for isolation of rare barotolerant variants in normal bacterial populations.
TI  - Properties of erythromycin-inducible transposon Tn917 in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strain DS16 harbors two plasmids, a conjugative plasmid, pAD1, which encodes hemolysin and bacteriocin activities, and a nonconjugative plasmid, pAD2, encoding resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and erythromycin, the latter of which is inducible. The erythromycin resistance determinant is located on a 3.3-megadalton transposable element designated Tn917, which could be transposed to pAD1 as well as to two other plasmids, pAm gamma 1 and pAM alpha 1. When strain DS16 was exposed to low (inducing) concentrations of erythromycin for a few hours, the frequency of Tn917 transposition from pAD2 to pAD1 increased by an order of magnitude. This induction paralleled induction of erythromycin resistance and was prevented by exposing the cells to inhibitors of deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid or protein synthesis. The exposure of strain DS16 to inducing concentrations of erythromycin also enhanced the frequency of erythromycin-resistant transconjugants appearing during mating. Initially, cointegrate molecules, whose molecular weights were approximately the sum of pAD1 and pAD2, accounted for these transconjugants; however, as the induction time increased, pAD1::Tn917 became increasingly prominent.
TI  - Effects of fatty acids on lysis of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids at concentrations of 200 nmol/ml all inhibited autolysin activity 80% or more in whole cells or cell-free extracts. This concentration of the saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and stearic acid had little or no effect on the growth of whole cells or protoplasts. However, the unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid and linoleic acid induced lysis in both situations. This lytic effect is apparently not related to any uncoupling activity or inhibition of energy catabolism by unsaturated fatty acids. It is concluded that unsaturated fatty acids induce cell and protoplast lysis by acting as more potent membrane destabilizers than saturated fatty acids.
TI  - Subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Two patients in whom various immunological phenomena obscured and delayed the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) are described. Immunological abnormalities usually correlate well with the chronicity and severity of the disease, as is demonstrated here. The mechanisms underlying the various immunological phenomena are discussed. The importance of alertness to the possibility of SBE in cases of disease manifesting itself as an immunological disorder, thus achieving early diagnosis and early antimicrobial treatment, is stressed.
TI  - [Inactivation of viruses and bacteria in sewage sludge by gamma radiation (author's transl)].
AB  - The kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. All these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. The reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. Considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. The radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.
TI  - Visualization of cell-cell contact during conjugation in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Conjugal transfer of an antibiotic resistance plasmid in Streptococcus faecalis was associated with direct intercellular connections between chains of streptococci in the absence of either pili or fimbriae.
TI  - Structure of the nucleoid in cells of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The structure of the nucleoid of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) was examined  and compared in the unfixed and fixed states by immersive refractometry and electron microscopy. It appears from these studies that the nucleoid structure is much more centralized in unfixed chloramphenicol-treated (stationary-phase) cells than it is in cells in the exponential phase of growth. The more dispersed configuration of the exponential-phase nucleoid could be preserved by fixation in glutaraldehyde, but not in Formalin or in osmium tetroxide. One important factor in explaining these differences in preservation is that glutaraldehyde (but not Formalin or osmium tetroxide) can rapidly cross-link the amino groups of macromolecules in cells. It was also observed that osmium tetroxide resulted in a preferential breakdown of nascent ribonucleic acid. These results are interpreted as indicating that glutaraldehyde is able to stabilize the exponential-phase nucleoid before it assumes the more central appearance seen in osmium tetroxide- and Formalin-fixed cells. These results are discussed in terms of the proposed organization of the exponential-phase nucleoid in unfixed cells.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of dilute formocresol and eugenol and propylene glycol.
AB  - Formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. Both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. Propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. It is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. Standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. The investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. Evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. Propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.
TI  - Effect of macromolecular synthesis and lytic capacity on surface growth of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Exposure of exponential-phase cultures of Streptococcus faecalis to any of three  inhibitors of protein synthesis was accompanied by an increase in the average distance that the cross wall extended into the cytoplasm. This resulted in: (i) an increase in the average surface area of the cross wall (Sa) and (ii) septation occurring in the envelope growth sites that were much smaller than the controls. However, although at the concentrations used, all three antibiotics inhibited protein synthesis and autolytic capacity to the same extent and with the same kinetics, cells treated with these agents showed large differences in the rate at which Sa values increased above those of the untreated cells. The largest increases in Sa were observed in cells that synthesized the least amount of cytoplasmic macromolecules (deoxyribonucleic acid, plus ribonucleic acid, plus protein). The observations were interpreted in terms of a model in which a decreased lytic capacity reduces the rate of splitting of the nascent cross wall into two layers of peripheral wall, preferentially using wall precursors to close open cross walls. However, the extent to which centripetal growth occurs would be inversely related to the rate at which cytoplasmic macromolecules are synthesized. In contrast, inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was accompanied by decreased extension of the leading edge of the cross wall into the cytoplasm, thus antagonizing septation. These findings are discussed in relation to the normal cell division cycle of S. faecalis.
TI  - Energy coupling to potassium transport in Streptococcus faecalis. Interplay of ATP and the protonmotive force.
AB  - We have studied the mechanism by which metabolic energy is coupled to potassium accumulation by the fermentative bacterium, Streptococcus faecalis. In starving cells, K+ movements into the cells or out are very slow; even 42K+/K+ exchange requires concurrent metabolism of glucose or arginine. Metabolizing cells accumulate K+, establishing a concentration gradient of some 50,000. Accumulation is prevented by reagents that block or short circuit the proton circulation, but 42K+/K+ exchange persists. In glycolyzing cells whose proton pump has been blocked with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, net uptake of K+ can be induced by imposing an artificial membrane potential, interior negative. Net K+ efflux is also controlled by the interplay of ATP and the proton circulation. Addition of proton conductors to glycolyzing cells induces K+ efflux, but has no effect on starving cells; the rate of K+ efflux appears to be a function of the cells' ATP content. We conclude that K+ accumulation requires the cells to generate both a protonmotive force and ATP. K+ uptake is electrogenic and attains a concentration gradient far too steep to be in equilibrium with the membrane potential. We consider two alternative models for K+ transport: a primary ATP-driven pump regulated by the proton circulation or a secondary porter activated by ATP that mediates symport of K+ with H+.

TI  - Combined effect of benzylpenicillin and gentamicin/netilmicin on Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of gentamicin and netilmicin were determined for 55 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, approximately half of which were recovered by culture of blood samples from patients with endocarditis. The IC50 for gentamicin was less than 5 micrograms/ml for 22 strains and less than 40 micrograms/ml for all strains, and for netilmicin the IC50 was less than 5 micrograms/ml for 51 strains and less than 40 micrograms/ml for all strains. Eight out of the 55 strains were found to have IC50 values greater than 10(4) micrograms/ml for streptomycin (3). The bacterial effect of combinations of benzylpenicillin and gentamicin or netilmicin was studied in 19 strains of S. faecalis which represented different levels of resistance to streptomycin. Netilmicin was as effective as gentamicin in combination with benzylpenicillin against all strains.
TI  - Biological properties of L-forms and their parent bacteria.
AB  - L-forms of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes  and Salmonella typhy and their parent bacteria were examined for biological properties and compared with their parental forms. Some L-forms differed from their parent bacteria and required a longer incubation period.
TI  - Induction of stable L-forms of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Stable L-forms were induced from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. These formed typical foamy L-colonies and showed large and small round bodies. They grew continuously on routine antibiotic-free nutrient broth and blood agar media for 12 passages without reversion to their parental forms. At different concentrations of penicillin various morphological forms were observed. Effect of sucrose, normal horse serum and penicillin on their adaptation and stabilization is discussed.
TI  - Drug resistance of organisms isolated from feces of laboratory mice and rats.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of EScherichia coli, 132 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 137 of Streptococcus faecalis and 89 of STr. faecium were collected from feces of 40 mice and 36 rats of 8 colonies in 1978, and drug resistance were examined by an agar dieution method using 23 antibiotics. The results indicated a positive relation between use of antibiotics and appearance of multiple drug resistant organisms.
TI  - Survival of faecal streptococci in raw and pasteurised egg products.
AB  - 1. The ability of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains to survive in egg albumen and liquid whole egg before and after laboratory pasteurisation was studied. 2. Pasteurisation of egg albumen caused a decrease in viable cells of less than 10-fold, while pasteurisation of whole egg caused decreases of more than 100-fold in only two of the eight strains studied. After growth in whole egg, some strains were more resistant to pasteurisation in whole egg. 3. Strep. faecalis multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg but not in egg albumen. 4. Strep. faecium multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg only after an initial decline in viability which was not shown by cells adapted to whole egg. Together with storage temperature this affected the number of viable cells after a storage period of 5 d. 5. In raw and pasteurised egg albumen Strep. faecium strains lost viability; this was maximal at 37 degrees C and more cells survived as the storage temperature decreased.
TI  - A novel mechanism of resistance to penicillin-gentamicin synergism in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A patient with enterococcal endocarditis, who relapsed after repeated courses of  apparently adequate treatment with ampicillin plus gentamicin, was subsequently cured with ampicillin-tobramycin therapy. The organisms isolated from this patient were strains of Streptococcus faecalis that were resistant to penicillin (or ampicillin)-gentamicin synergism but not to penicillin (or ampicillin)-tobramycin synergism. The mechanism of resistance in these strains appears to be related to a specific defect in the intracellular uptake of gentamicin (but not tobramycin) in the presence of penicillin.
TI  - Ontogeny of the inflammatory response in the fetal rat.
AB  - Fetal rats of 16, 17 and 18 days gestation (dg) were injected with turpentine or  Streptococcus faecalis in 1% India ink. Specimens of peritoneal tissues and exudates were collected at 24, 48 and 96 h after injection. Inflammation was present in some of the youngest animals (16 dg) 24 h after injection with bacteria. The response consisted of infiltrates of polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear (MN) cells in tissues adjacent to the peritoneum. Inflammatory cells were also found within the peritoneal cavity. Phagocytosis of ink particles and bacteria was noted in these cells and in cells of the serosa and adjacent mesenchyme. Free peritoneal cells were not seen in littermate controls. Phagocytosis was also noted in PMNs and MNs in the exudates collected at 48 h. A more marked granulocytic response was seen in animals sacrificed 24 h following bacteria-ink injection at 17 dg. Inflammation was more extensive and consistent by 19 dg. The reaction to turpentine was associated with the variable degree of tissue injury noted in histologic sections. The gestational age at time of injection was a more important determinant of the magnitude and character of response than was the duration of the lesion.
TI  - Antimicrobial synergism of piperacillin and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The potential synergistic effect of piperacillin with gentamicin was examined against five isolates each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis isolated from patients with endocarditis. Piperacillin and gentamicin synergistically inhibited all strains of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus tested. They exerted no synergistic effect against S. faecalis. Piperacillin and gentamicin synergism may be clinically tested in the treatment of serious pseudomonas and staphylococcal infections but not against infections caused by S. faecalis.

TI  - Experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 3. Significance of the proteolytic capacity of the infecting strains of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Insertion of a polyethylene catheter into the left ventricle of the heart was used for regular establishment of sterile endocarditis, and bacterial endocarditis was established by injection of approximately 10(8) Streptococcus faecalis into the blood stream at the same time as removal of the catheter which had been in place for 3 days. 100 out of 102 rabbits died spontaneously of bacterial endocarditis. Evidence is produced that the host-parasite interaction is influenced by the proteolytic property of S. faecalis in this experimental model. Two distinct types of clinical course are described: 1) A predominantly acute and damaging illness, characterized by a high level of bacteraemia, small amounts of soft, friable vegetations in the left side of the heart, high frequency of kidney infarcts and shorter survival time in rabbits infected with proteolytic strains. 2) A relatively subacute illness, characterized by a lower level of bacteraemia, large, hard, non-friable vegetations on the aortic valves, less pronounced destructive changes in the substance of valve leaflets, relatively lower frequency of kidney infarcts and longer survival time in rabbits infected with non-proteolytic strains. The results suggest that proteolytic strains of S. faecalis cause partial dissolution of the vegetations resulting in a more severe clinical picture.
TI  - Effects of cerulenin on antibiotic-induced lysis of streptococcus faecalis (S. faecium).
AB  - Addition of the antibiotic cerulenin to cultures lowered the minimal effective concentration of penicillin G or methicillin required to produce bacterial lysis and killing. This effect was most pronounced at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations. Cerulenin had no significant effects on lysis or killing induced in the presence of D-cycloserine, fosfomycin, bacitracin, or vancomycin.
TI  - Kinetic studies on enzymatic acetylation of chloramphenicol in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The kinetics of chloramphenicol (CP) acetylation by CP acetyltransferase from Streptococcus faecalis was studied. CP was shown to be acetylated enzymatically to its 3-O-acetyl derivative (3-AcCP) in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A, after which 3-AcCP was converted nonenzymatically to its 1-O-acetyl isomer, 1-O-acetyl CP (1-AcCP). At equilibrium, the 1-AcCP and 3-AcCP were present in a 1:4 ratio. Subsequently the diacetylated product, 1,3-O-O-diacetyl CP [1,3-(Ac)2CP], was enzymatically produced from 1-AcCP by the same enzyme. Theoretical calculation of rate constants (k1, k2, k3) for each successive reaction is as follows: (Formula: see text). This calculation gave k1 = 0.4 min-1, k2 = 0.002 min-1, and k3 = 0.016 min-1. Experimental results agreed closely with these calculated values.
TI  - Effect of growth rate on lipid and lipoteichoic acid composition in Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The lipid composition of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) was analyzed at various growth rates. Diphosphatidylglycerol and the non-ionic lipid fraction containing diacylglycerols and neutral glycolipids appeared to accumulate relative to cellular mass as the culture mass doubling time increased from 30 to 80 min. Within the same range of doubling times the non-ionic lipid fraction appeared to become substantially enriched with diacylglycerols. All lipid species and cellular lipoteichoic acid accumulated relative to the cellular mass at doubling times exceeding 80 min, although diacylglycerol accumulation exceeded that of all other compounds studied.
TI  - [Crossed resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in Streptococcus faecalis].
AB  
TI  - High-level, plasmid-borne resistance to gentamicin in Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes.
AB  - Each of three isolates of Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes harbored three  R plasmids and a hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid. The plasmids carried by one of these strains were physically characterized after their conjugative transfer. In each strain one of the plasmids carried genetic markers for resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin.
TI  - Action and interaction of penicillin and gentamicin on enterococci.
AB  - The action and interaction of benzylpenicillin and gentamicin on Streptococcus faecalis was studied using mainly turbidimetric methods. The minimum antibacterial concentration (MAC) of each antibiotic lay considerably below the conventionally determined minimum inhibitory concentration, and levels of the two agents exceeding the MAC were necessary in order to obtain a synergic interaction. Evidence was obtained that gentamicin interfered with bacterial lysis induced by penicillin, and this suggests that the aminoglycoside is responsible for the bactericidal activity of the combination, the role of the penicillin being solely to facilitate access of the aminoglycoside to its target site. Our findings do not, however, fully support the generally held view that the increased permeability of enterococci to aminoglycosides is due to penicillin-induced cell wall damage. 'Persisters'--cells surviving prolonged exposure to the optimum lethal concentration of penicillin--were not killed by subsequent exposure to gentamicin if the penicillin was removed but were killed if the penicillin remained present.
TI  - Structure and properties of the putrescine carbamoyltransferase of Streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  - Ornithine and putrescine carbamoyltransferases from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC11700 have been purified and their structural properties compared. The molecular weight of native ornithine carbamoyltransferase, measured by molecular sieving, is 250 000. It is composed of six apparently identical subunits with a molecular weight of 39 000, as determined by cross-linking with the bifunctional reagent glutaraldehyde followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate. Using the same method, putrescine carbamoyltransferase is a trimer of 140 000 consisting of three identical subunits with a molecular weight of 40 000. Ornithine carbamoyltransferase displays a narrow specificity towards its substrate, ornithine. In contrast, putrescine carbamoyltransferase carbamoylates ornithine and several diamines (diaminopropane, diaminohexane, spermine, spermidine, cadaverine) in addition to its preferred substrate, putrescine, but with a considerable lower efficiency than for putrescine. The kinetic mechanism of putrescine carbamoyltransferase has been investigated. Initial velocity studies yield intersecting plots using either putrescine or ornithine as substrate, indicating a sequential mechanism. The patterns of protection of the enzyme by the reactants during heat inactivation as well as the results of product and dead-end inhibition studies provide evidence for a random addition of the substrates. The putrescine inhibition that is induced by phosphate does, however, suggest that a preferred pathway exists in which carbamoylphosphate is the leading substrate. The different kinetic constants have been established. The properties of putrescine carbamoyltransferase are compared to the known properties of other carbamoyltransferases. The evolutionary implications of this comparison are discussed.
TI  - A resonance Raman and electronic absorption probe of membrane energization. Quinaldine red in cells of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Resonance Raman and electronic absorption spectra were used to show that the state of an amphiphilic cation, relative to dilute aqueous solution, changes when it is accumulated by cells of Streptococcus faecalis when they are energized. The general characteristics of the cation employed, quinaldine red, closely paralleled those of other amphiphilic cations which have been used to measure membrane potential. A major aspect of the change is that in sodium-loaded cells, essentially all of the quinaldine red accumulated as the result of energization forms a strong bond with an anionic group. This binding is similar to that which occurs for the basal level of quinaldine red taken up in nonenergized cells. Ionic binding was detected using resonance Raman spectroscopy through shifts associated with a N+ parallel C--C parallel C stretching vibration to lower frequency on uptake. Another aspect of the change in state is that the cell-localized probe cation can aggregate while ionically bonded in a card pack fashion, the transition dipoles being parallel. A combination of resonance Raman and electronic absorption spectroscopy was used to characterize this aggregation. The aggregates were estimated to contain at least five quinaldine red cations at or near van der Waals contact, and the presence of other molecules, such as phospholipids, could not be excluded. Aggregation effects are complex depending on the ratio of cells to probe cation, and on energization. The site of binding is suggested to be the lipid bilayer region of the plasma membrane on the basis of experiments with liposomes and other model systems. In addition, some quinaldine red may be present in the cytoplasm in an aggregated, ionically bound form. The change in state on uptake following energization seems to be associated with a membrane potential, similar spectral and uptake effects being produced by an artificially generated membrane potential in cells and liposomes. The results show that membrane potential cannot be computed in a simple manner from the distribution of quinaldine red between cells and medium, assuming that the thermodynamic activity coefficient of cell-localized material is identical with that in dilute aqueous solution. However, uptake as well as subsequent ionic binding of quinaldine red seems to be related to potential in an as yet undefined manner.

TI  - A study of the surface-active properties of the Mg2+-activated ATPase from cytoplasmic membranes of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The surface activity and enzymic properties of the factor F1, the catalytic moiety of Streptococcus faecalis H+-ATPase, has been studied at the air-water and phospholipid-water interfaces. F1 does not interact with the monolayer phospholipids, hence its adsorption on a biological membrane must be due mainly to its recognition of proteins of the hydrophobic complex. The dimensions of the F1 molecule at the air-water interface have been estimated. In the presence of Mg2+, base area is S = 1.8 . 10(4) A2, height h = 27 A. Bearing in mind the size of a globular subunit, it follows from the measurements that the major F1 subunits should all lie in the same plane. The ATPase activity of F1 at the interface is inversely proportional to the monolayer density. With low density monolayer, the specific ATPase activity is higher at the interface than in the bulk of the solution. Adsorption of F1 at the interface shifts the isoelectric point of tiscussed relative to the proton-active transport mechanism.

AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - Effect of protein synthesis on plasmid maintenance in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmid-to-chromosome ratios in Enterobacteriaceae, upon interruption of protein  synthesis by chloramphenicol, are either conserved or increased when measured by dye buoyant density centrifugation. We have found, on the other hand, that the effect of inhibition of protein synthesis on the amount of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid visualized by this method in two strains of Streptococcus faecalis appears to differ from these established systems. A three- to sixfold decrease in covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid was observed when lysates of chloramphenicol-treated cultures were submitted to dye buoyant density centrifugation. A loss of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid was also evident from electrophoretic profiles of these lysates. Several conditions which could account for the apparent loss of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid upon inhibition of protein synthesis are discussed.
TI  - Effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. XIV. Bacteriolytic effects of human sera, synovial fluids, and purulent exudates on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis: modulation by Cohn's fraction II and by polyelectrolytes.
AB  - Normal sera and plasma, derived from humans, calves, rats, rabbits, horses, human synovial fluids, inflammatory exudates, and leukocyte extracts, when sufficiently diluted are highly bacteriolytic for Staph, aureus, Strep. faecalis, B. sutilis and to a variety of gram-negative rods. On the other hand, concentrated serum or the other body fluids are usually not bacteriolytic for these bacterial species. While the lysis of Staph, aureus and B. subtilis by diluted serum is not lysozyme dependent, lysis of Strep. faecalis is absolutely dependent on the concentration of lysozyme. The lytic factor in human serum is present in Cohn's fractions III, IV, and V. It is nondialyzable, resistant to heating for 75 degrees C and 20 min, and acts optimally at pH 5.0. Like leukocyte extracts, synovial fluids, and inflammatory exudates, it lyses only young staphylococci. The inability of concentrated serum to lyse Staph. aureus and Strep. faecalis is due to the presence in the gamma globulin fraction of a potent inhibitor, which can be partly removed by dilution of by adsorption upon the homologous bacteria. Lysis of the bacteria is also strongly inhibited by Cohn's fraction II (gamma globulin) by high-molecular-weight DNA, heparin, liquoid, and histone. The possible role played by serum globulin in the protection of bacteria against degradation by leukocyte is discussed.
TI  - Does penicillin kill bacteria?.
AB  - The thesis is presented that the bactericidal action of penicillin and of other inhibitors of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis, such as vancomycin and cycloserine, is secondary or tertiary to their ability inhibit specific reactions in the assembly of an osmotically protective cell wall. Examples are given of the inhibition of these reactions, which results in inhibition of cell growth (bacteriostatic action) in the absence of either cellular lysis or rapid loss of viability. Thus, in some instances, inhibitory concentrations of these drugs are, in effect, sublethal; this is true, for example, for Streptococcus mutans, a species of bacteria that is part of the normal flora of the oropharynx and that can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis. On the other hand, the damaging effects of the subminimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G on Streptococcus faecalis, a species with an active autolytic enzyme system, can be uncovered and converted to a lytic (and lethal) response by partial inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with low concentrations of cerulenin. Some theoretical and practical implications of the occurrence and inhibition of these secondary lethal consequences are discussed.

TI  - Presumptive identification of enterococci from other D streptococci by a rapid sodium chloride tolerance test.
AB  - Ability of enterococci to cause severe disease in humans and their relative resistance to chemotherapeutic agents necessitate their differentiation from other group D streptococci. We developed and evaluated a medium that differentiates enterococci from other group D streptococci within 4 to 24 hours. The 410 clinical isolates used in this study consisted of 328 strains of enterococci and 82 strains of other group D streptococci. The method showed 100 percent sensitivity and specificity with the conventional sodium chloride test. It is simple, reliable, and rapid.
TI  - Species-specific resistance to antimocrobial synergism in Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Combinations of penicillin with various aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols were tested against a collection of clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecium in vitro and were used to treat endocarditis caused by S. faecium in the rabbit model. S. faecium proved more resistant to penicillin than Streptococcus faecalis. Even more striking, however, was the resistance to in vitro synergism by combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides. At clinically achievable concentrations, penicillin-gentamicin was the only combination that was synergistic against all strains that were tested. Combinations of penicillin and streptomycin and penicillin and amikacin were synergistic only against those strains that were not highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin, respectively. Combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, or netilmicin failed to produce synergism against any of these strains. The possible clinical significance of these findings was verified by use of the rabbit model of endocarditis. Combinations of penicillin with gentamicin or streptomycin were synergistic in the therapy of endocarditis that was produced by a strain of S. faecium that did not have a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides. However, the combination of penicillin and netilmicin was no more effective than penicillin alone.

TI  - Stereospecificity of sodium borohydride reduction of tyrosine decarboxylase from  Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Sodium boro[3H]hydride reduction of tyrosine decarboxylase from Streptococcus faecalis followed by complete hydrolysis of the enzyme produces epsilon-[3H]pyridoxyllysine. Degradation of this material to [4'-3H]pyridoxamine and stereochemical analysis with apoaspartate aminotransferase shows that the re side at C-4' of the cofactor is exposed to solvent at pH 5.5 and 7.0. After binding of L-tyrosine at pH 5.5 or tyramine at pH 7.0 to the holoenzyme, sodium boro[3H]hydride reduction proceeds from the si face at C-4' of the substrate . cofactor complex. This indicates one of two conformational changes occurs upon binding of substrate; either rotation about the C-4 to C-4' bond in the cofactor or rotation about the axis through the C-5 and C-5' bond.
TI  - Trout mortalities as a result of Streptococcus infection.
AB  - Excessive mortalities were experienced in the bigger rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) at an efficiently managed trout farm. All tests for known toxins in the feed and water proved to be negative. A faecal Streptococcus which belongs to the Lancefield group D but which could not be identified as belonging to any of the recognized species within this group, was isolated from the spleens, livers and kidneys of affected fish. Pathogenicity studies with this organism proved it to be highly fatal to trout but not to Mozambique bream (Sarotherodon mossambicus), banded bream (Tilapia sparrmenii), carp (Cyprinus carpio) or largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). The isolation and biochemical characteristics of the organism are described. The symptoms, gross- and histopathology of this disease are described and discussed. The disease resembles a haemorrhagic septicaemia and appears to be associated with intensification and conditions of stress.

AB  - Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes strain DS16 was found to harbor two plasmids, designated pAD1 (35 megadaltons) and pAD2 (15 megadaltons). pAD1 is transmissible and determines a hemolysin-bacteriocin, whereas pAD2 is non-conjugative and determines resistance to erythromycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. pAD2 could be mobilized by pAD1, but usually involved formation of a pAD1-pAD2 cointegrate.
TI  - Release of autolytic enzyme from Streptococcus, faecium cell walls by treatment with dilute alkali.
AB  - The autolytic enzyme (endo-beta-1,4-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase) of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) was released in a soluble form from insoluble cell wall-autolytic enzyme complexes by treatment with dilute NaOH at 0 degree C. Treatment of cell wall-enzyme complexes, obtained from either exponential- or stationary-phase cells, with 0.008 to 0.01 N NaOH gave maximum yields of autolytic enzyme activity. At a fixed concentration of NaOH, the yield of autolysin increased with increasing wall densities and was accompanied by the release of methylpentose and phosphorus in amounts proportional to the autolysin. Since extraction of wall-enzyme complexes with 4.5 M LiCl at 0 degree C also removed methylpentose and phosphorus, release of enzyme with NaOH did not appear to result from hydrolysis of covalent linkages. The autolytic enzyme activity released from intact cells, or cell walls, was predominantly in the later (proteinase activable) form which could be activated by trypsin or a proteinase present in commerical bovine plasma albumin.
TI  - Theoretic and experimental analysis of the ability of a commercially prepared system to detect mixtures of bacteria.
AB  - The validity of the biochemical identification of bacteria presumes that the inoculum consists of a pure growth of bacteria. The detection of mixtures of bacteria with the Analytab Enteric (API 20E) system was tested. Using a computer to predict the response of the API 20E system to mixed cultures, the presence of a mixture was not detected in 15% of all pairwise combinations of 324 common organisms of the Enterobacteriaceae family and in 19% of all pairwise combinations of Enterobacteriaceae with four gram-positive cocci. These theoretic predictions were confirmed experimentally for selected mixtures in which the bacteria were combined in equal concentrations. These results indicate that a purity subculture plate must be used to insure the detection of mixtures of bacteria, because the API 20E system fails to detect a large number of mixtures and may erroneously identify the organisms in such mixtures.
TI  - The effect of three frequently applied antibiotics on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract of mice.
AB  - The influence of treatment with increasing oral doses of three absorbable antibiotics on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract was investigated in mice. Mice treated with ampicillin or epicillin in any of the applied doses had a strongly decreased colonization resistance as demonstrated by 'bacterial overgrowth' after contamination with resistant strains of Escherichia coli. After a treatment period 2 weeks, Streptococcus faecalis became resistant in a number of animals. Oral treatment with cephradine on the other hand had no obvious influence on the endogenous flora of the mice, nor was the colonization resistance decreased.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of runoff water from pastureland.
AB  - Runoff from a cow-calf pasture in eastern Nebraska was monitored for total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), and fecal streptococci (FS) during 1976, 1977, and 1978. Bacteriological counts in runoff from both grazed and ungrazed areas generally exceeded recommended water quality standards. The FC group was the best indicator group of the impact of grazing. Rainfall runoff from the grazed area contained 5 to 10 times more FC than runoff from the fenced, ungrazed area. There was little difference in TC counts between the two areas, but FS counts were higher in runoff from the ungrazed area and reflected the contributions from wildlife. Recommended bacteriological water quality standards, developed for point source inputs, may be inappropriate for characterizing nonpoint source pollution from pasture runoff. The FC/FS ratio in pasture runoff was useful in identifying the relative contributions of cattle and wildlife. Ratios below 0.05 were indicative of wildlife sources and ratios above 0.1 were characteristic of grazing cattle. Occasions when the FC/FS ratio of diluted cattle waste exceeded one resulted from differential aftergrowth and die-off between FC and FS. The FC/FS ratio and percentage of Streptococcus bovis in pasture runoff are useful indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of livestock management practices for minimizing bacterial contamination of surface water. The importance of choice of medium for the enumeration of FS in runoff derived from cattle wastes is discussed.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Morphological and physiological study of autolytic-defective Streptococcus faecium strains.
AB  - Three autolytic-defective mutants of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) were isolated. All three autolytic-defective mutants exhibited the following properties relative to the parental strain: (i) slower growth rates, especially in chemically defined medium; (ii) decreased rates of cellular autolysis and increased survival after exposure to antibiotics which block cell wall biosynthesis; (iii) decreased rates of cellular autolysis when treated with detergents, suspended in autolysis buffers, or grown in medium lacking essential cell wall precursors; (iv) a reduction in the total level of cellular autolytic enzyme (active plus latent forms of the enzyme); (v) an increased ratio of latent to active forms of autolysin; and (vi) increased levels of both cellular lipoteichoic acid and lipids.

TI  - [Rapid methods useful for determination of streptococcal groups with special reference to streptococci of groups B and D].
AB  - A study was carried out on the efficiency of certain rapid methods for the identification of streptococcal groups, especially groups B and D, methods based upon physiologic properties such as hippurate hydrolysis, production of pigment, esculin hydrolysis, tolerance to salt and bilolysis, associated with the classical tests, for instance the hemolysis type and sensitivity to bacitracin and optochin. By these tests, accessible to hospital laboratories, a number of 3083 streptococcal strains were correctly identified within 2 to 18 hours, of which 2567 group A, 31 group B, 184 group C, G, 113 group D, 155 Str. pneumoniae and 31 viridans, strains isolated from pathological products.

TI  - Enzymatic deacylation of lipoteichoic acid by protoplasts of Streptococcus faecium (Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790).
AB  - High-molecular-weight, micellar lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was converted to a lower-molecular-weight, apparently deacylated polymer when the former was incubated in the presence of growing protoplasts of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790), but not when incubated in fresh or spent protoplast medium. The mobility of the low-molecular-weight polymer upon agarose gel electrophoresis was indistinguishable from that of native extracellular lipoteichoic acid LTA(X) from this organism or from chemically deacylated LTA. Native LTA(X) was shown to contain less than one fatty acid equivalent per 18 LTA(X) molecules, in contrast to the 4:1 ratio of fatty acids to polyglycerolphosphate chains in micellar LTA.
TI  - [Lactic acid bacteria and streptococci of the human stomach normally and in pathological processes].
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were either absent or present in negligent quantities in the stomach of apparently healthy man. But in case of various pathological processes in the stomach and duodenum lactic acid bacteria accumulated (up to a million cells per 1 ml of gastric contents). Under these conditions coccal forms sharply prevailed over the bacillary ones. In patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer of the stomach the most frequent were Streptococcus faecalis and its variants; in oncological patients--Str. faecium, strains affiliated to Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and sometimes Str. durans.
TI  - The Chediak-Higashi syndrome: quantitation of a deficiency in maximal bactericidal capacity.
AB  - The maximum bactericidal capacity of neutrophils from a patient with the Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) was measured by a quantitative assay in which the neutrophils were challenged with increasing multiples of Staphylococcus aureus, 502A. At various bacterial challenges from 0.5 to 65 bacteria per neutrophil, the CHS cells killed normal numbers of bacteria in 60 minutes. However, at higher ratios with a mean of 118 bacteria per neutrophil, the percentage of bacteria killed in 60 minutes by CHS neutrophils (8.1 +/- 2.3%) was significantly less (P < 0.001) than that killed by normal neutrophils (44 +/- 2.3%). The CHS neutrophils lagged in their ability to kill low challenges of bacteria (0.5 or 1.2 bacteria per neutrophil) only at 20 minutes. A hydrogen-peroxide-producing strain of Streptococcus faecalis was killed normally by the CHS neutrophils at 60 minutes, with all ratios of challenge up to 114 to 1. Electron microscopic examination of 60-minute specimens from high ratios of challenge that were stained for myeloperoxidase activity revealed a failure of many bacteria-laden phagosomes to display this marker of degranulation. The results of this study indicate that the maximal bactericidal capacity of CHS neutrophils is saturated by a significantly lower challenge of bacteria than is required to saturate normal cells. This appears to be the result of sequestration of a significant portion of these cells' bactericidal resources in the giant granules that do not participate appreciably in degranulation.
TI  - Systemic group D streptococcal infection in newborn infants.
AB  - Thirteen cases of group D streptococcal neonatal sepsis and/or meningitis were identified at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital from 1970 to 1976. Ages at onset of disease ranged from 1 to 25 days. The most frequent symptoms were fever (five cases), lethargy (five cases), and respiratory difficulty (four cases). Blood cultures for seven infants were positive; CSF cultures for five infants were positive; and CSF and blood cultures for one infant were both positive. In 12 patients, parenteral antibiotic therapy consisted of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside. One infant with a severe meningomyelocele died. The other 12 infants showed a rapid clinical response with seven patients improving within 48 hours of the start of therapy. Infection with group D streptococcus results in a low-grade systemic disease in both full-term and premature infants that responds favorably to appropriate therapy.

TI  - Comparative in vivo nitrogen-15 nuclear magnetic resonance study of the cell wall components of five Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The proton-decoupled 9.12 MHz 15N NMR spectra of 15N-labeled Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus auresu, Streptococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus lysodeikticus intact cells, isolated cells walls, and cell wall digests have been examined. The general characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria 15N NMR spectra and described and spectral assignments are provided, which allow in vivo 15N NMR to be applied to a wide range of problems in bacterial cell wall research. The qualitative similarity of the intact cell and cell wall spectra found in each bacteria allowed the 15 N resonances observed in the proton broad-band noise-decoupled 15N NMR spectra of intact cells to be assigned to cell wall components. Each of the five Gram-positive bacteria displayed a unique set of cell wall 15N resonances, which reflected variations in the primary structure of peptidoglycans and the amounts of teichoic acid and teichuronic acid in the cell wall, as well as the dynamic properties of the cell wall polymers. Spectral assignments of cell wall 15 N resonances assigned to teichoic D-Ala residues, teichuronic acid and acetamido groups, and peptidoglycan acetamido, amide, peptide, and free amino groups have been made on the basis of specific isotopic labeling and dilution experiments, comparison of chemical shifts to literature values, determination of pH titration shifts, cell wall fractionation experiments, and comparative analysis of the cell wall lysozyme digest spectra in terms of the known primary sequences of peptide chains. All the peptidoglycan 15N peptide resonances observed in the intact cells and isolated cell walls could be accounted for by residues in the bridge or crossbar regions of the peptide chains, which indicated that only the cross-linking groups had a high degree of motional freedom. Thermal- and pH-induced conformational changes around the cross-linking D-Ala residues were detected in the B. licheniformis cell wall lysozyme digest products. Comparison of the proton broad-band noise-decoupled and gated decoupled intact cell and cell wall 15N spectra indicated that broad-band proton decoupling resulted in nulling of cytoplasmic resonances and enhancement of the cell wall resonances by the 15N [1H5 nuclear Overhauser effect.
TI  - Characterization of groups N and D streptococci isolated from rumen fluids.
AB  - Twelve strains of streptococci of serological groups N and D were isolated from rumen fluids of nine cows on four rations although both groups were not isolated from the same animal. The twelve were representative of a larger number of streptococci isolated by enrichment in milk. Generally, the physiological characteristics of the isolates indicated members of the lactic or enterococcus groups; however, several were atypical in one or more of the tolerance tests. Physiologically typical Streptococcus lactis but not S. cremoris, were isolated.
TI  - Precursor-product relationship of intracellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acids of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Exponential biosynthesis and excretion of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) during the exponential phase of growth, and continued synthesis and excretion during valine starvation of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790), were shown. During exponential growth, extracellular LTA (LTAx) accounted for approximately 13% of the total LTA in cultures, whereas during valine starvation, this percentage increased to approximately 60% within 4 h. LTAx was present in a low-molecular-weight, apparently deacylated form, whereas intracellular (LTAi) was present primarily in an apparently high-molecular-weight, acylated and micellar form. Experiments utilizing chases of either fully equilibrated or short pulses of [14C]- or [3H]glycerol were used to demonstrate that LTAx was derived directly from LTAi.

TI  - The steady state kinetics of tyrosine decarboxylase from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The present study has explained the general reaction mechanism of the bacterial tyrosine decarboxylase. The rate equation for this mechanism has been presented. The steady state kinetics of tyrosine decarboxylase, as for tyrosine transaminase, have shown that the apoenzyme can bind not only the coenzyme, but also the non-enzymatically formed Schiff base between the coenzyme and the substrate. Our data then have confirmed the importance of the non-enzymatically formed Schiff base in the B6-dependent enzymes, possibly in all of them which have a low affinity constant for the coenzyme, such that the coenzyme must be present in excess in respect to the protein to saturate the active center. The interaction between apotyrosine decarboxylase with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate has been studied.
TI  - Influence of lipids from Listeria monocytogenes on the course of infections due to some gram-positive bacteria in mice.
AB  - The influence of lipids from Listeria monocytogenes on the course of infections due to some gram-positive cocci Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus and L. monocytogenes was studied in white mice. Varying doses of the lipid preparation were administered before infection. Mortality of the animals and rate of elimination of the bacteria from the organs and blood circulation were recorded. In appropriate doses, the lipids markedly enhanced resistance to the aforementioned bacteria. Mortality was substantially reduced, and elimination of the infectious agent from tissues and blood was significantly accelerated.
TI  - Antagonistic effects of Bacillus natto and Streptococcus faecalis on growth of Candida albicans.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory effects of Bacillus natto and Streptococcus faecalis on Canida albicans were investigated. When inoculated into the filtrate of a long-term culture of B. natto strain BN (BN), a stock culture of C. albicans RIMD 0301020 lost its viability completely, whereas C. albicans RIMD 0301011, a fresh isolate from a clinical source, did not. In continuous flow (CF) culture the growth of both strains of C. albicans was suppressed by mixed cultivation with BN. On the other hand, in classical batch culture BN did not suppress the growth of C. albicans. S. faecalis BIO-4R, a multi-drug resistant strain, was also antagonistic to C. albicans RIMD 0301011 but symbiotic with BN in CF culture. These findings suggest that BN in concert with S. faecalis BIO-4R may inhibit the growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract.
TI  - Aeration sensitizes Streptococcus faecalis to hydroxyurea.
AB  - Hydroxyurea in up to 60 mM concentration did not inhibit growth or DNA synthesis  in nonaerated cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043. In contrast, in cultures aerated by shaking already 1 mM hydroxyurea decreased the rate of net DNA synthesis and in higher concentrations of the drug the growth of the total cell mass also slowed down and the number of cells per chain increased from 1-2 to 10. The differential rate of DNA synthesis, but not the growth of the total cell mass, could be restored almost to the control level by adding thymidine to the medium. Thus there are at least two targets for hydroxyurea in the cells of S. faecalis grown in aerated cultures.
TI  - Untyped forms of faecal streptococci in Egyptian sewage and Nile water.
AB  - When the thallous-azide agar medium was used a higher incidence of pure faecal streptococci recovery was recorded especially from slightly polluted vehicles such as river water than on the standard M-enterococcus agar medium. In addition, a thallous-azide combination at pH 6.5 was used successfully for the primary isolation of Str. faecalis and its two variants. Results of biochemical tests of 274 faecal streptococci isolates showed that 20% belonged to Str. faecalis and its two variants as well as Str. durans, Str. faecium and Str. equinus. Thirty-eight percent of the isolated strains were classified as atypical I, II, III, and V previously designated by COOPER and RAMADAN (1955) as well as the unclassified group of RAMADAN et al. (1972). While the remaining 42% were found to belong to seven different categories (SALEH 1976 and 1977). The correlation between four differential tests used for defining the source of faecal streptococci isolates was discussed.

TI  - [Laboratory diagnosis of group D Streptococcus].
AB  - After taxonomic listing of group D streptococci, the authors discuss the methodology of the bacteriologic diagnosis of infections produced by these bacteria, showing the way in which the pathological products are collected, the strains isolated and seeded. The strains are identified in two stages: (1) group identification by group antigen identification, resistance to oxacillin, development at +45 degrees, development on bilaesculin media; (2) species and variety identification by biochemical, physiologic and metabolic tests, by lysotyping and enterocinotyping. A description is given of the testing of sensitivity of the strain to antibiotics by determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. The formulas of the media used for culture and identification are given.
TI  - Studies with cefuroxime: a new beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporin.
AB  - 28 patients suffering from a variety of bacterial infections have been treated with cefuroxime. 18 were cured and 6 improved during treatment. Side effects were minimal and intramuscular injection was well tolerated. Serum and urine levels well in excess of the MICs of sensitive organisms were obtained using dosages of 750 mg 8 hourly. Biliary excretion was impaired in the presence of obstruction, but adequate bile levels of cefuroxime were observed following relief of the obstruction. Cefuroxime was widely active against gram-negative bacilli and against Streptococcus faecalis, but less active against Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Effects of local anesthetics on bacterial cells.
AB  - The membrane effects of chlorpromazine, nupercain, tetracain, and procain were studied using Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, and Streptococcus faecalis, protoplasts from S. faecalis, and isolated membranes from B. subtilis. Chlorpromazin, nupercain, and tetracain produced characteristic micromorphological alterations after treatment for 5 to 30 min at pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C; the membrane staining pattern changed from asymmetric to symmetric, complex mesosome-like structures appeared, and membrane fractures and solubilization occurred. Procain at concentrations up to 100 mM did not induce detectable alterations. Protoplasts were quickly lysed by 10 mM tetracain. A rapid and extensive leakage of K+ was induced by chlorpromazin, nupercain, and tetracain. Procain (100 mM) induced a slight K+ leakage. The membrane respiratory activity of intact B. cereus cells (as measured by the triphenyl tetrazolium reduction) and the succinic dehydrogenase activity of B. subtilis isolated membranes were found to be inhibited by the four local anesthetics. The concentrations that produced 50% inhibition of those activities are correlated with the hydrophobicities of the anesthetic molecules.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of nitroxoline and sulphamethizole alone and in combination in urinary tract infections.
AB  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activity of nitroxoline and sulphamethizole, alone and in combination, were undertaken and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined on a range of urinary pathogens. Eighty per cent of the strains tested were sensitive to less than or equal to 16 mg/l of nitroxoline, and all strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, were sensitive to less than or equal to 64 mg/l of nitroxoline. No synergism could be demonstrated with sulphamethizole, but the combination was antagonistic when tested against strains of Ps. aeruginosa and Strep. faecalis. An in vivo study on 10 volunteers showed excellent urinary levels of nitroxoline and sulphamethizole after an oral dose of 160 mg of each agent, and 6-hour urinary nitroxoline levels were greater than or equal to 64 mg/l in 9 of the 10 subjects, and sulphamethizole levels were greater than or equal to 64 mg/l in all 10 subjects. Laboratory findings suggest that nitroxoline and sulphamethizole are both suitable agents for use in urinary tract infections caused by organisms sensitive to these agents, but there appears to be litte advantage in using them in combination.
TI  - Association between Streptococcus faecalis urinary infections and graft rejection in kidney transplantation.
AB  - In the first month after transplantation 50% of 193 consecutive renal transplant  recipients had bacteriuria. The most common organisms isolated were Streptococcus faecalis (34), Escherichia coli (28), Pseudomonas spp. (11), and staphylococcus (9). There was a significant correlation between infection with Str. faecalis and graft failure at one, three, and twelve months. This observation suggests that urinary infection with Str. faecalis may be associated with graft failure which is probably the result of immunological factors.

TI  - Carriage of group D streptococci in the human bowel.
AB  - Sixty faecal samples, 39 from adults and 21 from neonates, were investigated by means of a simple scheme to isolate and identify any group D streptococci present. A number of differences were found between the two groups. Group D streptococci were absent from 43% of the neonates compared with only 13% of the adults; Streptococcus bovis was commoner in the neonates (23.8%) than in the adults (5%), and Streptococcus faecium was not isolated from any of the infant samples although it was common in the adult samples (25%). The viable counts of Strep. faecium were found to be, on average, 100-fold lower than those of Streptococcus faecalis. The methods and results are discussed with reference to the clinical significance of group D streptococci, especially in bacterial endocarditis and carcinoma of the colon.
TI  - Incidence and relationship of group D streptococci with other indicator organisms in meats.
AB  - Raw and processed meats were analyzed for presumptive group D streptococci using  KF streptococcus agar. Counts were compared with coliform, presumptive Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae counts but no meaningful relationships were observed. Results indicated that group D streptococci and E. coli type I were principally contaminants from the packing plant, rather than at retail level. The predominating group D streptococcus in both beef and pork cuts was Streptococcus faecalis, while in processed meat (bologna), the predominating group D streptococci were Streptococcus faecium var. durans and Streptococcus faecium. Streptococcus bovis was not detected among the isolates from any meat samples. Marked differences were noted in numbers of group D streptococci in processed meat from different manufacturers. The results did not support the use of group D streptococci as alternative indicator organisms for meats. However, the association of group D streptococci with packing plant contamination may prove to be of value.

TI  - Effect of serum on gram-positive cocci grown in the presence of penicillin.
AB  - Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, and a strain of Streptococcus that produces filaments were grown on agar containing penicillin at concentrations of one-half to 1/10th the minimal inhibitory concentration. These penicillin-exposed organisms as well as untreated control organisms were incubated with human serum of plasma. Both serum and plasma produced a remarkable bactericidal effect on the filament-forming Streptococcus grown in the presence of penicillin, whereas the untreated control was only slightly affected. This response resembled that of gram-negative bacilli rather than that of gram-positive cocci. The growth of staphylococci exposed to penicillin was slightly inhibited in the presence of serum, whereas the growth of untreated staphylococci was stimulated. The streptococci, regardless of whether they were treated with penicillin or whether they were untreated, showed no change in growth pattern in the presence of serum.

Three strains proved to harbor minicircular plasmid DNA of uniform length as evidenced by CsCl ethidium bromide density centrifugation and electron microscopy. Molecular weight determination obtained through contour length measurements showed 2.4 X 10(6) dalton for S. faecium 25, 3.4 X 10(6) dalton for S. faecium 3 and 3.8 X 10(6) dalton for S. faecium 59. Elimination experiments for bacteriocin production with intercalating dyes proved sterile. The role of these plasmids remains for the time being unknown.
TI  - Non-group D streptococcal meningitis misidentified as enterococcal meningitis. Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of misdiagnosis by screening microbiology.
AB  - Two patients had nonhemolytic Gram-positive coccal meningitis. Both pathogens were initially misidentified as a group D enterococcus by growth in "selective" media, which led to the use of inappropriate and potentially toxic systemic and intrathecal aminoglycosides. Careful evaluation of the antibiotic sensitivity data and additional microbiological studies allowed correct identification of the organism. The important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in differentiating true enterococcal infections, especially meningitis, from those caused by other alpha-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci are emphasized. A simple laboratory schema for rapid recognition of such pathogens is reviewed.
TI  - Effects of temperature on the autolytic enzyme system of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The cellular autolytic reaction system in Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was analyzed for relative increases in reaction rates with increasing temperature by determination of Arrhenius activation energies (E). The systems examined were: (i) an isolated wall-enzyme complex in 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.9; (ii) exponential-phase cells suspended in 0.01 or o.3 M sodium phosphate pH 6.8, or in 0.04 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, (iii) growing cultures deprived of glucose or lysine; and (iv) cultures treated in growth media with the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. For detergent-treated cells, E values were between 23.9 and 27.4 kcal/mol (ca. 100.1 to 174.7 kJ/mol) at concentrations of Triton X-100 between about 0.03 and 0.072 mg/ml. E values dropped sharply to 11.5 to 13.0 kcal/m-l (ca. 48.2 to 54.4 kJ/mol) at Triton X-100 concentrations of 0.12 mg/ml or higher. For the remaining systems, E values ranged from 16 to 20 kcal/mol (ca. 67.0 to 83.7 kJ/mol) (wall lysis, cellular autolysis in 0.01 M sodium phosphate or in 0.04 M ammonium acetate, and autolysis of glucose-starved cells) to 31 to 38 kcal/mol (ca 129.8 to 159.1 kJ/mol) (cellular autolysis in 0.3 M sodium phosphate or autolysis of lysine-starved cells). High concentrations of Triton X-100 appear to lower the E values below the 16 to 20 kcal/mol observed for the autolysis of isolated walls. This effect may be related to disruption by the detergent of a hydrophobic complex regulating cellular autolysis in vivo.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of diphenhydramine (author's transl)].
AB  - Diphenhydramine (N,N-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [N,N-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (DPH) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. We tested its antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the MIC of this compound against various bacteria. DPH inhibits the growth of E. coli and Klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and Streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. The results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% DPH to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction.

AB  - Five hundred and thirty-six samples of honeycombs were examined in a laboratory in the years 1971-1974. In all the samples clinically determined as the foul brood, B. alvei was isolated as a pure culture, and enterococci, or both microorganisms were isolated in mixed form. Twenty-five strains of the isolated streptococci were analyzed microbiologically and biochemically; on the basis of their culture and biochemical characteristics five strains were designated as Streptococcus faecalis, 14 strains as Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens, five strains as Streptococcus faecium and one strain as Streptococcus durans. After checking the used taxonomic key of the culture and biochemical classification of B. alvei it may be stated that the culture and biochemical characteristics are stable. The strains of B. alvei (very dried strains), which persisted in the dried slant meat-peptone agar, were viable under the laboratory conditions, which proves the high resistance of the spores to the environment.

TI  - Treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  - Five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. The causative microorganisms were Streptococcus bovis, S faecalis, S agalactiae, S intermedius, and Staphylococcus aureus. Except for the strain of S faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. To insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by S faecalis. There was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. Vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. Vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.

TI  - A new hydrolase specific for taurine-conjugates of bile acids.
AB  - Through the investigation of the bile acid-deconjugation activities of human intestinal anaerobes, a new enzyme was discovered in Peptostreptococcus intermedius which hydrolyzed specifically the taurine-conjugates, but not the glycine-conjugates of bile acids. However, the enzymes in Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus brevis hydrolyzed chiefly the glycine-conjugates.
TI  - Experimental endocarditis in rabbits. 2. Course of untreated Streptococcus faecalis infection.
AB  - Insertion of a polyethylene catheter in the left side of the heart was used to induce sterile endocarditis in 34 rabbits. Bacterial endocarditis was established by injection of approximately 10(8) Streptococcus faecalis into the blood stream simultaneous with the removal of the catheter which had been in place for 3 days. The course of the bacterial endocarditis was examined by autopsy of rabbits sacrificed at regular intervals after the infection. The results showed that the presence of the catheter was not essential for the induction or maintenance of the infection. Growth of the bacteria took place in the preformed vegetations in the aorta, on the aortic valves and in the left ventricle. However, increases in the size of the vegetations, a high density of bacteria in the vegetations and secondary spreading were found only on the aortic valves. The extracardial manifestations of left-sided S. faecalis endocarditis included constant bacteriaemia, a high frequency of septic kidney infarcts and enlargement of the spleen. This form of experimentally provoked bacterial endocarditis in rabbits provides a good imitation of human subacute endocarditis, and would thus seem to be suitable for further study of the pathophysiology of endocarditis and evaluation of the effect of treatment with antibiotics.
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis on a prosthetic valve. Oral treatment with amoxicillin.
AB  - A patient with endocarditis due to Streptococcus faecalis on an aortic valvular prosthesis was successfully treated using large oral doses of amoxicillin concurrently with intramuscular administration of streptomycin. Oral therapy was employed because of a persistent reaction to intravenously administered antibiotics. Oral therapy for bacterial endocarditis occurring on an artificial valve may be attempted as a last resort when all other accepted therapeutic measures have failed.
TI  - Aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes in clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis. An explanation for resistance to antibiotic synergism.
AB  - Clinical isolates of enterococci (Streptococcus faecalis) with high-level resistance to both streptomycin and kanamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration >2,000 mug/ml), and resistant to synergism with penicillin and streptomycin or kanamycin were examined for aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. All of the 10 strains studied had streptomycin adenylyltransferase and neomycin phosphotransferase activities; the latter enzyme phosphorylated amikacin as well as its normal substrates, such as kanamycin. Substrate profiles of the neomycin phosphotransferase activity suggested that phosphorylation occurred at the 3'-hydroxyl position, i.e., aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase. A transconjugant strain, which acquired high-level aminoglycoside resistance and resistance to antibiotic synergism after mating with a resistant clinical isolate, also acquired both enzyme activities. Quantitative phosphorylation of amikacin in vitro by a sonicate of the transconjugant strain inactivated the antibiotic, as measured by bioassay, and the phosphorylated drug failed to produce synergism when combined with penicillin against a strain sensitive to penicillin-amikacin synergism.No differences were found in the sensitivity of ribosomes from a sensitive and resistant strain when examined in vitro using polyuridylic acid directed [(14)C]-phenylalanine incorporation in the presence of streptomycin, kanamycin, or amikacin. Therefore, we conclude that aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes are responsible for the aminoglycoside resistance, and resistance to antibiotic synergism observed in these strains.

TI  - Solubilization and isolation of the membrane-bound DD-carboxypeptidase of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC9790. Properties of the purified enzyme.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 possesses six membrane-bound, penicillin-binding proteins. That numbered 6 (Mr 43000) is the most abundant one and is the DD-carboxypeptidase studied previously. The enzyme has been solubilized and purified to the stage where one single protein band can be detected by gel electrophoresis. The purification procedure does not alter the properties that the enzyme exhibits when it is membrane-bound. The DD-carboxypeptidase itself may be a killing target for penicillin in S. faecalis.
TI  - Accumulation of thallous ions (Tl+) as a measure of the electrical potential difference across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria.
AB  - The accumulation of thallous ions (204Tl+) by intact bacteria was investigated. I conclude that Tl+ is a permeant cation, and that it therefore accumulates in response to the electrical potential difference (delta psi) across the cytoplasmic membrane (interior negative). A comparison with other methods shows that the distribution ratio of 204Tl+ serves as a reasonably satisfactory method for measuring the membrane potential of Streptococcus faecalis. Glycolyzing cells of this organism develop membrane potentials of up to 180 mV. Preliminary experiments with Escherichia coli, especially those with a mutant defective in the proton-translocating ATPase, indicate that the Tl+ distribution also serves as a measure of the membrane potential in this organism. The particular advantage of Tl+ over other indicators of the membrane potential is that the cells need not be pretreated in any way. By use of the Tl+ distribution, it was calculated that respiring cells of E. coli develop a membrane potential of 160 mV with D-lactate and 180 mV with glucose as a substrate, respectively.

TI  - Group G streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  - The group G streptococcus may be a more common human pathogen than previously recognized. A case of group G streptococcal endocarditis is reported and the 11 cases reported previously are reviewed. Group G endocarditis may have significant clinical and prognostic differences from endocarditis caused by the more commonly identified viridans or group D streptococci. Routine serologic grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates from serious infections is warranted.
TI  - Molecular studies and possible relatedness between R plasmids from groups B and D streptococci.
AB  - Resistance plasmids isolated from Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) and S. faecalis (group D) have been compared in regard to resistance markers, molecular weight, and DNA-DNA homology. Three of them (pIP501, pIP612, and pIP613) have been found to confer identical (or very similar) resistance patterns (erythromycin, lincomycin, and streptogramin B, respectively) and to have similar molecular weights (19.8 x 10(6), 22.7 x 10(6), and 17.6 x 10(6), respectively) and a high level of DNA-DNA homology in hybridization experiments (90 to 100%). These results are compatible with the view that these plasmids may derive from one common ancestor, and/or that they can be transferred between unrelated Streptococcus strains belonging to the same or different groups.
TI  - Induced cell aggregation and mating in Streptococcus faecalis: evidence for a bacterial sex pheromone.
AB  - Recipient strains of Streptococcus faecalis produce a trypsin sensitive, heat resistant, nuclease resistant factor, designated clumping-inducing agent (CIA) which causes strains carrying certain conjugative plasmids to aggregate. RNA and protein synthesis but not DNA synthesis are required for aggregation to occur. Recipient filtrates that contain CIA activity also induce donors to mate at high frequencies. Introduction of a transferable plasmid into strains producing CIA dramatically reduces the amount of CIA activity produced by the strain but allows the strain to respond to exogenously added CIA. Our data suggest that CIA represents a bacterial sex hormone (pheromone).
TI  - Use of pyruvate fermentation compared with tetrazolium reduction in the differentiation of group D streptococci.
AB  - The reduction of 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride in the original medium of  Barnes (Journal of General Microbiology, 14, 57, 1956), and in a modified medium, was compared with the ability to ferment pyruvate as a means of separating Streptococcus faecalis from all other group D streptococci. The tetrazolium reduction test gave an occasional negative reaction with Str. faecalis strains. In addition, a number of strains gave a weakly positive reaction in the test, as did some strains of Str. faecium and Str. bovis. With some batches of tetrazolium, these weak reactions with Str. faecalis were so frequent that interpretation of the results was difficult. On the other hand, all Str. faecalis strains, and no other group D streptococci, gave a positive pyruvate-fermentation reaction in 48 hours.
TI  - Cellular lysis of Streptococcus faecalis induced with triton X-100.
AB  - Lysis of exponential-phase cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was induced by exposure to both anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and nonionic (Triton X-100) surfactants. Lysis in response to sodium dodecyl sulfate was effective only over a limited range of concentrations, whereas Triton X-100-induced lysis occurred over a broad range of surfactant concentrations. The data presented indicate that the bacteriolytic response of growing cells to Triton X-100: (i) was related to the ratio of surfactant to cells and not the surfactant concentration per se; (ii) required the expression of the cellular autolytic enzyme system; and (iii) was most likely due to an effect of the surfactant on components of the autolytic system that are associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. The possibility that Triton X-100 may induce cellular lysis by releasing a lipid inhibitor of the cellular autolytic enzyme is discussed.

TI  - Interactions of helium, oxygen, and nitrous oxide affecting bacterial growth.
AB  - Helium at pressures of 20 to 70 atm in the presence of air found to stimulate growth of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, mainly by increasing the rate of exponential growth. However, at these same pressures, helium potentiated the growth-inhibitory actions of oxygen and nitrous oxide (N2O). Oxygen was found to act essentially as an anesthetic gas in inhibiting growth of S. faecalis; its potency was approximately the same as that of N2O, and it acted additively in combination with N2O to inhibit the streptococcus. Oxygen proved to be more potent than N2O in inhibiting the growth of E. coli and S. aureus, and each gas potentiated the action of the other. Oxygen sensitivity was correlated with N2O sensitivity. Overall, our findings indicate that bacterial growth inhibition by anesthetic gases does not accurately reflect narcotic action.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial L-(-)-tyrosine decarboxylase by isoelectric focusing and gel chromatography.
AB  - The purification of L-(-)-tyrosine apodecarboxylase (TAD) (E.C. 4.1.1.25), obtained from extracts of cells of Streptococcus faecalis, has been investigated by means of preparative isoelectric focusing, molecular sieve chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Isoelectric focusing demonstrated two separate fractions possessing enzyme activity that had pI values of 4.5 and ca. 3.2. In the chromatographic methods, however, the activity was obtained in a single peak. It was found that hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose was particularly suitable for purification purposes. The enzyme is very firmly bound to octyl-Sepharose CL-4B but retains most of its activity even in the bound state.
TI  - Approximation of the cell cycle in synchronized populations of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Slowly growing populations (TD = 70 to 80 min) of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) were synchronized by selection after sucrose gradient fractionation. The cell cycle was approximated by correlating the patterns of DNA accumulation and cell division. More specifically, the beginning of cell cycle was equated with the beginning of a rapid linear increase in DNA accumulation. The DNA content of the culture approximately doubled during the period of accumulation, which lasted about 51 min. The period of rapid DNA accumulation, was followed by a period of reduced accumulation that lasted about 24 min. During synchronized growth, cell numbers increased rapidly in coordination with the period of rapid DNA accumulation and exhibited a plateau during the period of reduced DNA accumulation. In contrast, RNA and protein appeared to accumulate exponentially throughout the cell cycle at the same rate as culture mass.
TI  - Relationship between cellular autolytic activity, peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and the cell cycle in synchronized populations of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Synchronized, slowly growing (TD = 70 to 80 min) cultures were used to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. The rate of peptidoglycan synthesis per cell declined during most of the period of chromosome replication (C), but increased during the latter part of C and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (D). An increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. Cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of C, reached a maximum late in C or early in D, and declined during D. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during C prevented the decline in autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell division by inhibiting cell separation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during D did not prevent the increase in autolytic capacity during the next C phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. Thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. The data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed model for cell division of S. faecium (G.D. Shockman et al., Ann. N.Y Acad. Sci. 235:161-197, 1974).
TI  - Periurethral aerobic microflora of pregnant and non-pregnant women.
AB  - Seventy-two pregnant and 88 non-pregnant women were examined to see whether the periurethral region had been colonised with group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), enterococci, and Gram-negative rods belonging to the Enterobacteriaeceae. A semi-quantitative method was used for periurethral sampling, and paired urethral swabs were also collected to compare the isolation rates of group B streptococci from the two sites and with the two sampling methods. A higher isolation rate was found with periurethral sampling. Most specimens showed no or scanty growth of Gram-negative rods. Pregnancy was often associated with heavy growth of enterococci. Sampling performed during menstruation and while oral contraceptives were being used produced high isolation rates of group B streptococci. These results seem to suggest that the periurethral area might protect against genital colonisation with group B streptococci as it does against urinary tract infection and that hormonal factors influence the carriage of these organisms.
TI  - beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase of Streptococcus faecalis and the inhibition of its synthesis by glucose.
AB  - The lactose hydrolysing system of Streptococcus faecalis is described. It is closely related to that one of the group N streptocci as it consists of a beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (beta-Pgal). The uptake of methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (TMG), lactose, and glucose is maintained by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) but the uptake of galactose is not. The induction time is 6--7 min. Inducers are lactose and galactose but not isopropyl-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) and TMG. In the presence of glucose, mannose, and maltose no induction of beta-Pgal occurs but pyruvate and glycerol allow induction. The competitive inhibition of uptake of TMG by glucose suggests inducer exclusion by this sugar. TMG accumulates in the cells exclusively as a derivative.
TI  - Transformation of group F streptococci by plasmid DNA.
AB  - When the Challis strain of Streptococcus sanguis was transformed by the 17 megadalton beta plasmid from Streptococcus faecalis strain DS5, the plasmid underwent a 1.5 megadalton deletion (LeBlanc & Hassell, 1976). Furthermore, the covalently closed circular (CCC) plasmid DNA isolated from Challis transformants was rapidly converted to a linear form which did not possess any detectable transforming activity. To obtain stable CCC plasmid DNA a competent culture of a Lancefield group F streptococcus, strain DL8 (ATCC 12393), was used as a recipient of beta plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA isolated from group F transformants exhibited the same configuration and size characteristics as the DS5 beta plasmid, and the CCC configuration was stable upon storage. CCC plasmid DNA from a group F transformant was biologically active and, when added to competent cultures of strain DL8, transformed them at frequencies about 100-fold greater than did beta plasmid DNA from DS5. This suggests the existence of a restriction--modification system in strain DL8.

TI  - Plasmid-mediated mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics and to chloramphenicol in group D streptococci.
AB  - Genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics in three  group D streptococcal strains, Streptococcus faecalis JH1 and JH6 and S. faecium JH7, and to chloramphenicol in JH6 are carried by plasmids that can transfer to other S. faecalis cells. The aminoglycoside resistance is mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase enzymes that have substrate profiles very similar to those of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases found in gram-negative bacteria. Phosphorylation probably occurs at the aminoglycoside 3'-hydroxyl group. Plasmid-borne streptomycin resistance is due to production of the enzyme streptomycin adenylyltransferase, which, as in staphylococci and in contrast to that detected in gram-negative bacteria, is less effective against spectinomycin as substrate. Resistance to chloramphenicol is by enzymatic acetylation. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is inducible and bears a close resemblance to the type D chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variant from staphylococci.

AB  - The survival, recovery, and identification of Streptococcus isolates from soil was investigated by (i) examination of survival in soil under different moisture and temperature conditions, (ii) evaluation of media combinations for recovering fecal streptococci from soil, and (iii) partial identification of isolates from diverse habitats. Cool, moist conditions prolonged the survival of Streptococcus faecalis in soil for at least 12 weeks, whereas freezing was lethal, with the populations being reduced up to 95% when several freeze-thaw treatments occurred. Media evaluations indicated that both the efficiency of recovery and enumeration of the fecal streptococci from soil can be influenced by the combination of media used. Taxonomic data revealed a need to develop procedures to differentiate between isolates of fecal origin and plant-derived streptococci that possess many of the cultural reactions of S. faecalis. It was found that recent fecal isolates exhibited a much greater incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance than soil or vegetation isolates, and this characteristic, coupled with the use of enterococci as indicators of fecal contamination in soil systems, is discussed.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. It contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. Its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Mycobacterium lepraemurium. When used as an antigen in rabbits, the S. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. This antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of S. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other streptococci, such as S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. lactis. The inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of S. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of O(2) (-). A variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. The iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of H(2)O(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. Some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. Indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. There was no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their Gram-stain reaction.
TI  - Inhibition of protein synthesis in Streptococcus faecalis by ochratoxin A.
AB  - A non-competitive inhibition of binding of cAMP to bovine protein kinase by ochratoxin A (OTA) is shown. Preliminary evidence of a protein kinase in Streptococcus faecalis is presented. The cAMP stimulation of this kinase is also inhibited by OTA. At the lowest OTA concentrations, RNA and protein synthesis are inhibited in S. faecalis. The inhibition of RNA synthesis is secondary, as in the presence of chloramphenicol no inhibition occurs for 10 min after the addition of OTA. The synthesis but not the induction of beta-P-galactosidase is inhibited by OTA. The polysomes of S. faecalis are stabilized after addition of OTA, showing an inhibition of peptide elongation. The model of action of OTA in bacteria is discussed and it is concluded that inhibition of protein synthesis is the process which might be closest to the primary target of OTA.
TI  - Anti-glycosyl antibodies. Two sets of isoantibodies with specificity for different carbohydrate moieties of the same glycosyl antigen.
AB  - Two sets of anti-glycosyl antibodies have been isolated by affinity chromatography methods from the antisera of rabbits immunized with a vaccine of nonviable cells of Streptococcus faecalis, strain N. Both types of antibodies are directed against a dineteroglycan of glucose and galactose present in the cell wall of this organism. The members of one set, anti-galactose antibodies, combine with the terminal lactose residues of the glycan and the member of the other set, anti-lactose antibodies, combine with terminal lactose residues of the same glycan. Each set of antibodies is composed of multiprotein components. The electrofocusing method had been used to isolate the individual antibody proteins in homogeneous states as shown by both electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation techniques. Since the components of each set combine with the same structural unit of the antigen, they have been designated as isoantibodies. The sedimentation constants, electrophoretic properties, carbohydrate constituents, and amino acid compositions of the two sets of antibodies are recorded.

TI  - Rat model of experimental endocarditis.
AB  - A simple model of infective endocarditis was produced in rats. With the aid of a  guide wire, polyethylene catheters were passed into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery of Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g. A volume of 1 ml of an overnight culture of Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis was intravenously injected 1 to 2 days after catheterization. Bacterial titers of Streptococcus mitis in vegetations were about 10(4)-fold greater than in other tissues. Blood cultures were always positive after 6 h. Mortality was 19% at 1 week and 82% at 2 weeks. Catheters were pulled 24 h after infection, and vegetation titers of greater than 7.0 log10 colony-forming units per g were sustained at 5 days. In intravenously infected rats without catheters, blood and tissues were sterile after 3 to 5 days. With Staphylococcus aureus, vegetations had greater than 9.0 log10 colony-forming units and with Streptococcus faecalis 8.8 +/- 0.3 log10 colony-forming units per g at 2 days. The rat model of infective endocarditis should prove to be suitable for further pathological and therapeutic studies.
TI  - Gentamicin-based medium for the isolation of group D streptococci and application of the medium to water analysis.
AB  - Gentamicin-thallous-carbonate (GTC) medium contained (per liter): 40.0 g of Trypticase soy agar, 5.0 g of KH(2)PO(4), 2.0 g of NaHCO(2), 1.0 g of glucose, 1.0 g of esculin, 0.5 g of thallous acetate (TA), 0.5 g of ferric citrate, 0.75 ml of Tween 80, and 2.5 mg of gentamicin sulfate. The NaHCO(3) (20 ml of a 10% solution that had been heated to boiling) was added after sterilization of the basal medium. The spread plate technique was used to compare GTC agar with Pfizer selective enterococcus, TA, and KF agars by using sewage as well as bovine and swine fecal samples. Significantly greater numbers of group D streptococci were recovered on GTC agar than on Pfizer selective enterococcus or KF agars, within and over all samples. Higher counts also were obtained on GTC than on TA agar, but the differences were not statistically significant. The percentage of false positives was about the same for all four media. Samples of riverwater also were plated on GTC, TA, and KF agars, and significantly higher recoveries were obtained with GTC agar. GTC agar was superior to the other media examined primarily because of increased recoveries of Streptococcus bovis and S. equinus; other advantages of GTC agar were large colony size and short (24-h) incubation period. The percentage of false positives from riverwater was 13% for GTC agar and 0% for TA and KF agars; therefore, confirmation would be necessary when GTC agar is used with some types of environmental samples.
TI  - Neutralization effect of some agents on the antimicrobial activity of ammoniacal  silver nitrate.
AB  - The effect of some agents on the antimicrobial activity of ammoniacal silver nitrate, an endodontic medicament, was tested with Streptococcus faecalis by the serial tube dilution method. Its results indicated that sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, and blood had a marked inhibitory effect. However, the presence of dentin, necrotic tissue, saliva, and hydrogen sulfide gas liberated from protein decomposition showed no or little effect on the antibacterial properties of the chemical. Since antiseptics or antibiotics generally may be decomposed by necrotic tissues, these findings suggested that the use of ammoniacal silver nitrate not only may resolve the problem of recalcitrant cases in endodontic treatment but also may simplify the disinfecting procedure for root canals.
TI  - Monensin, Eimeria tenella infection, and effects on the bacterial populations in  the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - Bacteria-free chicks in separate plastic film isolators were inoculated orally with single species of bacteria. Within an isolator, half the birds were fed unmedicated feed and half received feed containing 100 ppm monensin. With clostridium perfringens as the established species of monoflora, bacterial counts from the duodenum were 10(4) times lower and counts from the ceca were three times lower in monensin-fed birds compared to unmedicated birds. Infection with Eimeria tenella stimulated an eight-fold increase in the numbers of C. perfringens in the ceca of unmedicated birds but no increase in monensin-fed birds. With Bacteroides sp. or Streptococcus faecalis as monoflora, there was no difference in the cecal or duodenal populations between medicated and unmedicated birds uninfected with coccidia. In contrast to C. perfringens, populations of Bacteroides sp. and S. faecalis in the ceca decreased five to 100-fold in both medicated and unmedicated chicks after infection with E. tenella. Duodenal populations of C. perfringens, Bacteroides sp., and S. faecalis were unaffected by the coccidial infection.
TI  - Penicillin-netilmicin synergism against Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The combination of penicillin plus netilmicin was synergistic in vitro against 28 strains of Streptococcus faecalis and compared favorably with penicillin in combination with gentamicin. Similarly, penicillin plus netilmicin was as effective as penicillin plus gentamicin in the therapy of 67 rabbits with enterococcal endocarditis produced with a streptomycin-susceptible (S) or a streptomycin-resistant (R) strain of S. faecalis. After 5 days of infection, control rabbits had bacterial titers of 10(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/g of vegetation. Those treated with penicillin plus netilmicin had mean titers of 10(5.2) and 10(5.1) CFU/g for S and R strains, respectively, and those treated with penicillin plus gentamicin had mean valve titers of 10(5.8) CFU/g for both strains. After 10 days of therapy, mean valve titers with penicillin plus netilmicin were 10(3.8) and 10(4.7) CFU/g, and with penicillin plus gentamicin they were 10(4.5) and 10(5.4) CFU/g for S and R strains, respectively. Thus, if netilmicin proves to be less toxic than other aminoglycoside antibiotics, it may have potential usefulness in the therapy of enterococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Cellular autolytic activity in synchronized populations of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The autolytic capacity of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) varied during synchronous cell division. This phenomenon was initially observed in rapidly dividing populations (TD=30 to 33 min) synchronized by a combination of induction and size selection techniques. To minimize the problems inherent in studies of cells containing overlapping chromosome cycles and possible artifacts generated by induction techniques, the autolytic capacities of slowly dividing populations (TD=60 to 110 min) synchronized by selection only were examined. Although the overall level of cellular autolytic capacity was observed to decline with decreasing growth rate, sharp, periodic fluctuations in cellular autolytic capacity were seen during synchronous growth at all growth rates examined. On the basis of similar patterns of cyclic fluctuations in autolytic capacity of cultures synchronized by (i) selection, (ii) amino acid starvation followed by size selection, and (iii) amino acid starvation followed by inhibition of DNA synthesis, a link of such fluctuations with the cell division cycle has been postulated.

The mutant strain was selected as a survivor from a mutagenized cell population simultaneously challenged with two antibiotics which inhibit cell wall biosynthesis, penicillin G and cycloserine. Compared to the parental strain, the mutant strain exhibited: (i) a thermosensitive pattern of cellular autolysis; (ii) an autolytic enzyme activity that had only a slightly increased thermolability when tested in solution in the absence of wall substrate; and (iii) an isolated autolysin that had hydrolytic activity on isolated S. faecalis wall substrate indistinguishable from that of the parental strain, but that was inactive when tested on walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a substrate. These data indicate an alteration in the substrate specificity of the autolytic enzyme of the mutant which appears to result from the synthesis of an altered form of autolytic enzyme.
TI  - Effect of cerulenin on Streptococcus faecalis macromolecular synthesis and cell division.
AB  - The antibiotic cerulenin has been used to study macromolecular synthesis and cell division in Streptococcus faecalis. The data suggest that lipid and lipoteichoic acid synthesis as well as cell number increase are affected prior to any observable effects on overall mass increase or DNA, RNA, protein, or peptidoglycan synthesis. Treatment with cerulenin of cultures growing at various rates and analysis of the subsequent cell divisions indicate that the antibiotic may block a cell cycle event that precedes the completion of chromosome replication by about 10 min.

TI  - Activation of the alternate complement pathway by peptidoglycan from streptococcal cell wall.
AB  - Activation of the alternate complement pathway in human serum by several bacterial components was compared. Peptidoglycan from group A streptococcal cell walls was the most active material, on a weight basis, followed by cell walls, protoplast membranes, and whole cells. The group-specific carbohydrate was inactive. Treatment of peptidoglycan with low concentrations of lysozyme or short periods of sonic treatment enhanced complement activation. High concentrations of lysozyme or extended sonic treatment of peptidoglycan destroyed or greatly reduced the capacity to activate complement. Lysozyme treatment of group A streptococcal cell walls or lipopolysaccharide had no measurable effect. Activation of the alternate complement pathway by group D streptococcal cell walls was destroyed by lysozyme. Activity of peptidoglycan was not inhibited by N-acetyl glucosamine, N-acetyl muramic acid, or D-alanine-D-alanine. Conversion of C3 and factored B by peptidoglycan was shown to occur by immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis.
TI  - Structural arrangement of polymers within the wall of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The structure of the cell wall of Streptococcus faecalis was studied in thin sections and freeze fractures of whole cells and partially purified wall fractions. Also, the structures of wall preparations treated with hot trichloroacetic acid to remove non-peptidoglycan wall polymers were compared with wall preparations that possess a full complement of accessory polymers. The appearance of the wall varied with the degree of hydration of preparations and physical removal of the cell membrane from the wall before study. Seen in freeze fractures of whole cells, the fully hydrated wall seemed to be a thick, largely amorphic layer. Breaking cells with beads caused the cell membrane to separate from the wall and transformed the wall from a predominantly amorphic layer to a structure seemingly made up of two rows of "cobblestones" enclosing a central channel of lower density. Dehydration of walls seemingly caused the cobblestones to be transformed into two bands which continued to be separated by a channel. This channel was also observed in isolated wall preparations treated with hot trichloroacetic acid to remove non-peptidoglycan polymers. These observations are consistent with the interpretation that both peptidogylcan and non-peptidoglycan polymers are concentrated at the outer and inner surfaces of cell walls. These observations are discussed in relation to possible models of wall structure and assembly.
TI  - Iron requirement and chelator production of staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The effect of iron deprivation on growth of 101 aerobic strains of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria was studied on agar media in the presence of various concentrations of the synthetic iron chelator ethylene diamine diorthohydroxyphenyl acetic acid (EDDA) and the iron binding protein transferrin. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited by 15 mM EDDA and 1.5 mM transferrin. Staphylococcus aureus was only inhibited by 44 mM EDDA and not by transferrin. None of the strains of S. faecalis was inhibited. The majority of the enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Salmonella spp, Klebsiella spp) was inhibited by 44 mM EDDA and 1.5 mM transferrin. The relation between susceptibility and concentration of EDDA and transferrin was expressed as S-value for each species. Iron supply with various iron compounds could restore the effects of inhibition. In all species except in S. faecalis iron chelator production could be demonstrated, using indicator plates of media containing EDDA and flooded with 10(4)--10(5) colony forming units of indicator organisms. The iron chelator of both S. epidermidis and S. aureus could stimulate growth of S. epidermidis, but not that of enterobacteriaceae. Iron chelators from all gram-negative bacteria were functionally interchangeable, but did not stimulate growth of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  - Potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. This applies to all investigated vehicles. However, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. This is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like Streptococcus bovis, Str. faecium, and Str. durans. Again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. On the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. Yet, sodium azide may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, Streptococcus species, and age of pollution. A lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. This applied to water and milk examination.

Combined differential-diagnostic nutrient medium permits to determine simultaneously 5 enterococci signs--resistance to nalidixic acid and to crystal violet, TTC reduction, hemolytic and proteolytic activity. The suggested scheme of enterococci laboratory diagnosis including a set of hard nutrient media poured into multisection Petri dish is simple reliable and accessible for any bacteriological laboratory.

AB  - Membrane fractions containing osmotically active vesicles with sufficiently low membrane permeability for K+, Na+ and Cl- ions typical for the intact cell membrane were isolated from the cells of the glycolyzing bacterium Streptococcus faecalis. In their osmotic properties and ionic permeability the membrane fractions of S. faecalis were found similar to those of the respiring bacterium Micrococcus lysodeikticus, which are capable of the energy-dependent potassium transport. It may be thus assumed that the S. faecalis fractions obtained may be used to study ionic transport. The removal of proton-dependent ATPase of the S. faecalis membrane preparations did not affect the permeability of membranes for K+ ions which is indicative of different mechanisms of proton and potassium translocation.

Non-enterococcal Group D streptococci were isolated from fecal cultures of 11 of 105 controls, 35 of 63 patients with carcinoma of the colon, seven of 25 with inflammatory bowel disease, four of 21 with non-colonic neoplasms and five of 37 with other gastrointestinal disorders. All such streptococci examined for lactose fermentation were S. bovis. The prevalence of S. bovis in fecal cultures from patients with carcinoma of the colon was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) as compared to that in controls, and also to all other groups (P less than 0.001). No other group had results significantly different from those of controls (P less than 0.05) although patients with inflammatory bowel disease were more frequently carriers. The carrier state was unrelated to age, hospitalization status, colonic stasis, gastrointestinal bleeding or recent barium-enema examination. The implications of this association are unknown.

AB  - The bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of Maize starch on Escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. This toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter sp. Moreover, for the eucaryote cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. The results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.
TI  - Antimicrobial lipids: natural and synthetic fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  - Over 40 natural or synthetic lipophilic compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity. Gram (+) bacteria and yeasts but not Gram (-) bacteria were affected by these agents. Epimino and selena fatty acids are more active than their corresponding straight chain unsubstituted fatty acids. The position of selenium influenced the antimicrobial activity of the fatty acids. The presence and position of a double or triple bond, usually an important factor in long chain fatty acids (greater than C14) had little or no effect in C11 fatty acids. Optimum antimicrobial activity was found for fatty acids and their corresponding monoglycerides when the chain lenght was C12. The dilaurin derivative was not active.

TI  - Cytotoxicity of rat macrophages activated by persistent or biodegradable bacterial cell walls.
AB  - Peritoneal macrophages from Fischer 344 rats were cytotoxic for mouse fibroblasts after in vitro phagocytosis of non-biodegradable group A streptococcal cell walls. In contrast, macrophages from Buffalo rats were not activated to cytotoxicity by bacterial cell walls. Activation to cytotoxicity was only achieved by the macrophages after an interval of at least 3 days in culture after ingestion of group A cell walls. If macrophages were cultured only 24 h after ingestion of cell walls, a cytostatic effect on target cells was observed. Phagocytosis of biodegradable group D streptococcal cell walls did not activate macrophages from either rat strain to become cytotoxic. No direct toxicity of cell walls for macrophages or mouse L-cells was observed. The cytotoxicity of Fischer 344 macrophages appears to require direct cell contact with target cells.
TI  - Processing of streptococcal cell walls by rat macrophages and human monocytes in  vitro.
AB  - Phagocytosis and degradation of cell walls by peritoneal macrophages obtained from Fischer 344 or Buffalo rats was measured in tissue culture. Group A cell wall antigen, detected by immunofluorescence, persisted in cultured rat macrophages for at least 40 days, whereas group D cell wall material was eliminated by 6 to 8 days. This same pattern of persistence of group A cell walls and elimination of group D cell walls was observed in cultures of human monocytes followed for 24 days in culture. Group A streptococcal cell walls labeled with either [14C]alanine or [14C]glucose were handled in a similar manner by macrophages from either Fischer 344 or Buffalo rats. In contrast, [14C]glucose-labeled group D cell walls were degraded at a much faster rate. Buffalo macrophages were more efficient than Fischer 344 macrophages in degrading group D cell walls. The inability of macrophages to degrade group A cell walls was not due to a failure of lysosomes to fuse with phagosomes. Neither serum lysozyme in the culture medium nor cell wall-associated autolysin contributed to the degradation of group D cell walls by macrophages. Neither immune serum nor macrophages obtained from specifically immunized rats influenced phagocytosis or persistence of group A cell walls.
TI  - Heterogeneity of nonimmune immunoglobulin Fc reactivity among gram-positive cocci: description of three major types of receptors for human immunoglobulin G.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty strains of various gram-positive cocci were tested for quantitative, nonimmune binding of radiolabeled human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG). The majority of coagulase-positive staphylococci and streptococci belonging to serogroups C and G showed a high uptake of IgG. The binding of immunoglobulin to group A streptococci was considerably less, with a number of strains completely negative. None of the pneumococcal or the group B or D streptococcal strains displayed any binding capacity. Heterogeneity of the IgG reactivity of various reactive strains was studied in an inhibition assay using 10 different animal serum pools. Three different inhibition patterns were seen, each of them revealing a striking degree of homogeneity within single bacterial species. Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci, respectively, constituted two homogeneous groups which differed markedly from each other and from C and G streptococci. No differences were observed between group C and G streptococci. Based on the profound differences between these homogeneous groups, three major types of Fc receptors could be defined. Type I and II Fc receptors were found on S. aureus and on group A streptococci, respectively. Fc receptor type III represented the immunoglobulin-binding structure of both group C and G streptococci.

AB  - L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis showed  significantly less chemotactic activity for normal human leucocytes than did parent bacterial forms which were strongly chemotactic. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma hominis did not demonstrate chemotactic activity.
TI  - Temperature effects on minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cell wall antibiotics in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined at 30 and  37 degrees C for several antibiotics affecting cell wall biosynthesis. The test organism, Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790, possesses a single autolytic enzyme and does not produce penicillinase. Penicillin, methicillin, and, possibly, bacitracin appeared more effective at 37 than at 30 degrees C. Vancomycin, ristocetin, and phosphonomycin appeared equally effective at both temperatures, and cycloserine appeared consistently more active at 30 than at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Transferable plasmids mediating multiple-antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens.
AB  - In strain HK187 (Streptococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens) four plasmids were isolated. The molecular weights, as analyzed in neutral sucrose gradients and by electron microscopy, were found to be about 36 x 10(6), 31 x 10(6), 26 x 10(6), and 4 x 10(6). Plasmid 3, also designated pFK14, with a molecular weight of 26 x 10(6), was found to be responsible for resistance to chloramphenicol and erythromycin and also for high-level resistance to streptomycin and lincomycin. In mixed cultures these four resistances could be transferred with high frequency to a plasmid-free recipient, S. faecalis strain JH2-2.
TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. VIII. The role of bacterial interference.
AB  - The non-pathogenic aerobic bacteria in 97 quantitative introital cultures from 11 women with documented recurrent bacteriuria were compared statistically to those in 100 quantitative introital cultures from 10 control women with no history of bacteriuria. The colonization incidence of the non-pathogenic organisms was not statistically different for the 2 groups, except for gamma hemolytic Streptococcus (p equals 0.002). No strongly significant correlations were demonstrated between the colonization incidence of Enterobacteriaceae or enterococci and the colonization incidence of the common non-pathogenic organisms, when analyzed for the bacteriuric and control groups or when analyzed for the individual cultures of each subject. A quantitative analysis of the 197 individual cultures failed to establish correlations between the presence of the common non-pathogenic organisms and Enterobacteriaceae or enterococci. The susceptibility of the vaginal introitus to colonization by urinary pathogens cannot be explained by interrelationships between these pathogens and the normal aerobic vaginal flora.
TI  - Inhibition of different serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes by enterocins in solid and liquid media.
AB  - Twenty-one enterocinogenic strains of enterococci were examined for their ability to inhibit 51 strains of Listeria monocytogenes belonging to eight different serotypes; 50 strains of L. monocytogenes were uniformly inhibited on solid media and in broth cultures by strains of Streptococcus faecium. However, only four strains of L. monocytogenes were inhibited by strains of Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis v. zymogenes or S. faecalis v. liquefaciens. Enterocin E1A prepared from the supernant fluid of S. faecium strain E1 rapidly killed sensitive cells of L. monocytogenes but did not lyse them.

TI  - Bacteriological studies in a patient with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous  colitis.
AB  - Detailed aerobic and anaerobic bacteriological studies on the operative specimen  from a patient with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis revealed approximately 10(11) facultatively anaerobic bacteria, but less than 10(5) obligate anaerobes per g of involved colonic tissue. Fourteen isolates of Escherichia coli, three isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two isolates of Streptococcus fecalis were identified. The majority of the organisms were resistant to most of the antibiotics that the patient had received. Examinations of E. coli for heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins and tissue invasiveness were negative, and enterotoxin tests on the P. aeruginosa isolates were negative. Inoculation of mice with the bacterial isolates revealed no unusual pathogenicity. These findings suggest that antibiotic-associated colitis is associated with a marked loss in anaerobic colonic flora, but the colitis could not be explained by the presence of enterotoxins, tissue invasiveness, and pathogenicity of remaining microorganisms.
TI  - Immune response and dental caries incidence in Streptococcus faecalis-monoassociated Harvard caries-resistant and caries-susceptible rats.
AB  - Harvard caries-resistant rats (CR) monoassociated with cariogenic Streptococcus faecalis (SF) for 150 days developed early high levels of specific SF serum agglutinins, moderate levels of salivary antibody, and little or no caries activity. Harvard caries-susceptible (CS) SF-monoassociated rats developed serum antibody more slowly and never reached the titers of the CR group. Little or no salivary agglutinin was found, and extensive caries developed. Second-generation monoassociated CR rats (CR-2) born to SF-monoassociated CR parents showed an immune response and caries activity more nearly resembling those of the CS rat than those of their CR parent. The CR rat appeared to be a high responder and the CS rat, a low responder to viable antigen on the mucous surfaces in both serum and salivary antibody production. Immunization by parenteral injection of killed SF cells produced equally high serum titers in both CR and CS strain rats, but failed to increase salivary agglutinin titers in any group or to protect against caries. These data suggest that there may be an immunologic basis for genetic differences in caries susceptibility between CR and CS Harvard rat strains and that this difference has been modified by some factor in the environment of the CR-2 rats.
TI  - Methodological aspects of an agar plate technique for determination of biologically active 5-fluorouracil in blood, urine and bile.
AB  - A microbiological agar plate technique for estimation of 5-fluorouracil concentrations in blood, urine and bile from man, dog and pig was evaluated. Different bacterial test strains, media modifications and techniques for inoculation were studied. The strain Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043, recommended previously by Clarkson et al., was found to be the most suitable. The influence of prediffusion, dilution, antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents and their antagonists, as well as the effect of storage of samples containing 5-fluorouracil were examined. A detailed methodological description is presented. The method seems to be sufficiently sensitive and practical for routine determination of cytotoxic compounds from 5-fluorouracil in serum, plasma and urine.
TI  - Efficacy of ammoniacal silver nitrate in root canal therapy.
AB  - In order to find a simple and effective method for endodontic treatment of recalcitrant cases, the efficacy of ammoniacal silver nitrate was re-evaluated. The modified serial tube dilution method was conducted to determine the effective antimicrobial concentration of ammoniacal silver nitrate on selected test microorganisms and clinical isolates. The effective antimicrobial concentration for the most resistant microorganism, Streptococcus faecalis, was 5.0 X 10(-10) g/ml and the effectiveness persisted for several days. The diffusion ability of 4% ammoniacal silver nitrate into the dentinal tubules from root canal wall was also tested with freshly extracted teeth treated as in routine procedure for root canal therapy. The diffusibility was evident and the extent of infiltration was various, with more infiltration at cervical dentin than at apical one.
TI  - An investigation of the bacteriological quality of retail vanilla slices.
AB  - One hundred and thiry-three vanilla slices, purchased from shops in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, were examined to determine the numbers and types of bacteria present at the time of purchase. The surface colony count at 37 degrees C was greater than 10(3)/g in 67/133 (50%) of the samples examined, Bacillus cereus being found at that concentration in 21.8%, coliform bacilli including E. coli in 5.3%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3-0% and Streptococcus faecalis in 0-8%. Thirty-four strains of B. cereus were serotyped and 11 (32%) of these were typable with the sera available. Preparation of custard mixed in the laboratory suggests that the milk or milk powder used in the mix may be the major source of B. cereus in the final product. Many of the present methods of manufacture, distribution and storage allow organisms present in the custard at manufacture the opportunity to multiply and possibly reach numbers which present a risk of food poisoning.
TI  - Genetic loci of hemolysin production in Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes.
AB  - Two plasmids corresponding to molecular weights of 38.5 X 10(6) and 3.6 X 10(6) have been identified in Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes strain X-14. The larger plasmid is required for hemolysin-bacteriolysin production. Strain L2, a nonlytic nitrosoquanidine mutant of strain X-14, still harbors the hemolytic plasmid and produces the lysin component, but not the activator component, of the lytic system. Conjugal transfer of this plasmid from strain L2 to plasmid-free strains and strains cured of the 38.5-megadalton plasmid gives rise to hemolytic recipients. This implicates a gene in hemolysin production at a site other than the 38.5-megadalton plasmid.

AB  - A total of 834 bacterial strains isolated from urine were subjected to rapid biochemical and serological identification and rapid antimicrobial sensitivity testing using Autobac 1. For enterobacteria (742 strains) six tests (acetoin-, beta-galactosidase-, hydrogensulphide-, indole-, ornithin-decarboxylase-and urease-production) correctly identified to genus or species level more than 99% of the strains within four hours. Staphylococci and streptococci (92 strains) were identified with full accuracy within two hours using a rapid deoxyribonuclease assay and immunoelectroosmophoresis and coagglutination. The overall accuracy for the automated antibiotic susceptibility testing using Autobac was 93% as compared to the standard plate diffusion method. In terms of rapidity for 91% of the bacterial strains the susceptibility testing was completed within four hours. After five hours 99% of the strains were analysed. Our data indicate that rapid and automated assays can be accurate and furnish the physician with adequate data within 24 hours after receipt of a urinary specimen.
TI  - Interactions between beta-lactam antibiotics and isolated membranes of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790.
AB  - The DD-carboxypeptidase-exchange membrane-bound enzyme in Streptococcus faecalis  ATCC 9790 reacts with beta-lactam antibiotics to form complexes with rather long half-lives. Depending upon the antibiotic, the second-order rate constants for complex formation range from 0.75-560 M-1 S-1 (at 37 degrees C and in water) and the first-order rate constants for complex breakdown range from 1.3 to 26 x 10(-5) s-1 (at 37 degrees C and in 5 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5). There are about 30 pmol of DD-carboxypeptidase-exchange enzyme per mg of membrane protein. The degradation products arising from benzylpenicillin are phenylacetylglycine and probably N-formyl-D-penicillamine. Isolated membranes also contain other penicillin binding sites (about 70 pmol/mg membrane protein). That part of benzylpenicillin which reacts with at least some of these latter sites is slowly degraded into penicilloic acid. Normal functioning of the DD-carboxypeptidase-exchange membrane-bound enzyme is important, if not essential, for cell growth. With the beta-lactam antibiotics tested inhibition of cell growth is mainly related to the rates of formation of the inactive enzyme-antibiotic complexes. The relationship, however, is not a direct one probably due to the competitive effect exerted by the other penicillin binding sites.

AB  - Under alkaline conditions, the membrane-bound DD-carboxypeptidase of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 catalyses exchange reactions in which the X-L-R3-D-Ala moiety of peptides of the type X-L-R3-D-Ala-D-Ala is transferred to simple amino compounds such as D-alanine, glycine and glycyl-glycine. The enzyme system is unable, however, to catalyse complex reactions that would simulate the natural transpeptidation reaction.
TI  - Evaluation of a new presumptive medium for group D streptococci.
AB  - A new medium designated as D streptococcus-enterococcus broth was formulated and  evaluated for the enrichment and isolation of strains of serological group D streptococci. This medium was made by modifying Todd-Hewitt broth. Most-probable-number multiple-tube and membrane filter techniques were employed to estimate the numbers of enterococci in known cultures, wastewater, and other samples. Preliminary most-probable-number counts with this medium were as much as 3 logs higher than those counts obtained from four other media with which it was compared. The methodology for using this medium to estimate the numbers of group D streptococci in water is discussed.
TI  - Rapid microbiological assay for chlorhydroxyquinoline that uses a cryogenically stored inoculum.
AB  - A rapid microbiological assay for chlorhydroxyquinoline is described. It is a turbidimetric procedure that uses Streptococcus faecalis as the test organism. Results are available within 5 h. Data are presented to show the advantages of using a cryogenically stored inoculum over an inoculum prepared on a daily basis.
TI  - Serum folates in man.
AB  - In an aseptic microbiological assay of folate compounds and their breakdown compounds, using Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis, and Pediococcus cerevisiae, 4a-hydroxy-5methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrofolate and 5-methyl-5,8-dihydrofolate were inactive under all conditions to all three organisms and 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was inactive unless ascorbate was present in the incubation medium, and then only to L. casei. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate was active only for L. casei, and activity in purified samples to S. faecalis was due to trace amounts of folic acid. Analysis of S. faecalis values in the serum in normal subjects and in patients with various disorders showed that levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate are raised in coeliac disease, leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate is readily absorbed by normal human subjects and by patients with pernicious anaemia but poorly absorbed by patients with coeliac disease or leukaemia. 5-Methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was quickly absorbed by normal human subjects, being reflected by a considerably raised level of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in serum when sodium bicarbonate was given by mouth before the 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate. These higher levels were comparable to those in patients with pernicious anaemia after oral administration of 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate. Oral 5-methyl-5,8-dihydrofolate and 4a-hydroxy-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate did not appear as microbiologically active folates in the serum. The findings of this study suggest that the availability for biological utilisation of the major dietary folate compounds will depend on the amount of gastric acidity and of ascorbate in the intestinal chyme. Many may be unavailable for metabolic utilization in the body.
TI  - Antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. II. Detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  - Human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against E coli. Blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against S epidermidis, and early growth of Streptococcus fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. The concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.
TI  - Characterization of plasmids determining hemolysin and bacteriocin production in  Streptococcus faecalis 5952.
AB  - Two plasmids designated pOB1 and pOB2 were isolated from Streptococcus faecalis strain 5952 and found to have molecular weights of approximately 46 X 10(6) and 28 X 10(6), respectively. pOB1 was found to determine hemolytic activity and was transmissible, whereas pOB2 appeared to determine a bacteriocin that is specifically inhibitory to S. faecalis strains harboring the 26-megadalton plasmid pAM539.
TI  - Analysis of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in a cariogenic strain of Streptococcus faecalis: an approach to identifying genetic determinants on cryptic plasmids.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strains ND539 and OG1 have been previously shown to be cariogenic in gnotobiotic animals. Deoxyribonucleic acid analyses have revealed the presence of a single 26-megadalton plasmid designated pAM539 in the former strain, whereas the latter strain was found to be plasmid-free. By gene transfer experiments, it was possible to construct isogenic pairs of strains that differed only with regard to the presence or absence of pAM539. Comparative studies of isogenic pairs showed that the presence of pAM539 conferred bacterial sensitivity to a bacteriocin produced by S. faecalis strain 5952.

AB  - The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, sisomicin, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, amikacin, and butirosin were determined for 58 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, 28 of which were recovered from cultures of blood samples from patients with endocarditis. The IC50 of streptomycin was less than 100 microng/ml for 42 strains, 192-10,000 microng/ml for eight, and larger than or equal to 10,000 micron/ml for eight. One isolate that was highly resistant to streptomycin was also highly resistant to kanamycin and butirosin. Extraordinarily high resistance to the other aminoglycosides was not observed. The bactericidal effects of combinations of penicillin and aminoglycosides were studied in 20 strains of S. faecalis that represented different levels of resistance to streptomycin. Significant enhancement of the effect of the combination of penicillin and streptomycin was found only in strains with an IC50 of smaller than or equal to 190 microng/ml. Combinations of penicillin and sisomicin, gentamicin, or tobramycin were effective even against strains that were highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin.
TI  - [Anatomic and bacteriological study of surgically extracted valves in patients with bacterial endocarditis].
AB  - We studied 64 cases of bacterial endocarditis which required heart surgery for hemodynamic defects and/or failure of the antibiotic therapy. We performed a bacteriologic and histologic investigation of the removed valves. The organisms were evidenced through culture and specific stainings. According to the different organisms we evaluated the best duration of antibiotic therapy to achieved sterilization, and suggest a helpful medical and surgical treatment for the bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Effect of a quinazolinone derivative on the metabolism of Streptococcus faecalis--R (ATCC-8043).
AB  - 2-methyl-3(3'-methyl-2'-pyridyl)-4 (3H) quinazolinone (SRC-820) and methaqualone  inhibited the growth of Streptococcus faecalis-R (ATCC-8043). Phosphoenolpyruvate formation from 3-phosphoglycerate by an enzyme extract of S. faecalis was inhibited by SRC-820. With edetate or fluoride, an additive inhibitory effect by SRC-820 was observed.
TI  - Energetics of streptococcal growth inhibition by hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - Growth of Streptococcus faecalis in complex media with various fuel sources appeared to be limited by the rate of supply of adenosine-5' -triphosphate (ATP) at 1 atm and also under 408 atm of hydrostatic pressure. Growth under pressure was energetically inefficient, as indicated by an average cell yield for exponentially growing cultures of only 10.7 g (dry weight) per mol of ATP produced compared with a 1-atm value of 15.6. Use of ATP for pressure-volume work or for turnover of protein, peptidoglycan, or stable ribonucleic acid (RNA) did not appear to be significant causes of growth inefficiency under pressure. In addition, there did not seem to be an increased ATP requirement for ion uptake because cells growing at 408 atm had significantly lower internal K(+) levels than did those growing at 1 atm. Pressure did stimulate the membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) or S. faecalis at ATP concentrations greater than 0.5 mM. Intracellular ATP levels were found to vary during the culture cycle from about 2.5 mumol/ml of cytoplasmic water for lag-phase or stationary-phase cells to maxima for exponentially growing cells of about 7.5 mumol/ml at 1 atm and 5.5 mumol/ml at 408 atm. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide at a 10 muM concentration improved growth efficiency under pressure, as did Mg(2+) or Ca(2+) ions at 50 mM concentration. These agents also enhanced ATP pooling, and it seemed that at least part of the growth inefficiency under pressure was due to increased ATPase activity. In all, it appeared that S. faecalis growing under pressure has somewhat reduced ATP supply but significantly increased demand and that the inhibitory effects of pressure can be interpreted largely in terms of ATP supply and demand.
TI  - Aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Thirty-four recent clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis were tested for sensitivity to amoxycillin, benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. Amoxycillin was two- to four-fold more active than benzylpenicillin and all strains were inhibited by low concentrations of the penicillins. The aminoglycosides were less active against the enterococci than were the penicillins and a significant number of strains were insensitive or relatively insensitive to one or more of the aminoglycosides. Thus, eight (23%) strains showed a high level of resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin (MIC greater 5000 microng/ml) but were sensitive to gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. In addition, two strains of Strep. faecalis, isolated at different hospitals from patients who had received topical gentamicin therapy, were relatively resistant to gentamicin (MIC250 to 500 microng/ml) and were less sensitive also to the other aminoglycosides. Bactericidal synergy was demonstrated by amoxycillin/aminoglycoside combinations against the enterococci, provided that the test strain of Strep. faecalis was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the combination. An exception to this was the combination of amoxycillin plus amikacin which was not synergistic against kanamycin-resistant strains of Strep. faecalis although these organisms were sensitive to amikacin in the growth inhibition tests. The gentamicin-resistant strains showed variable responses to amoxycillin/aminoglycoside combinations in tests for bactericidal synergy and were generally less sensitive than typical strains of Strep. faecalis.
TI  - Evaluation of the rapid hippurate hydrolysis test with enterococcal group D streptococci.
AB  - The rapid hippurate hydrolysis test was evaluated with the conventional test, using 17 group A streptococci, 9 non-enterococcal group D streptococci, 108 enterococcal group D streptococci, and 2 strains of Listeria monocytogenes. There was complete correlation between the rapid and conventional tests with all organisms except enterococcal group D. The rapid hippurate hydrolysis method was more sensitive with the enterococci; 95.4% were positive with the rapid method, and 9.3% were positive with the conventional method. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on all isolates to determine if the end product of hydrolysis, glycine, was indeed present. The TLC results were in agreement with the rapid and conventional methods for group A streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, and L. monocytogenes. TLC results were in total agreement with the rapid hippurate hydrolysis test for the enterococcal group D isolates, thus verifying the accuracy of this more sensitive test. Trace amounts of glycine were found in the substrate, indicating the need for including an uninoculated substrate control as well as stock strains of group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci (negative and positive controls, respectively) each time the rapid hippurate hydrolysis test is performed.
TI  - Teichoic acids of group D streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (Streptococcus suis).
AB  - Immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with Group D antisera. In phenol extracts from S. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with Group D antiserum, was seen. This difference probably accounts for the low yield of Group D antigen from S. suis as compared with S. faecalis and S. faecium when heating at pH 2 is used for extraction. When phenol is used good yields are obtained from S. suis as well as from S. faecalis and S. faecium. Lipoteichoic acids from S. faecalis and S. faecium have a backbone structure the same as or similar to that of Group A streptococcal teichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid from S. suis has a structure differing from that of S. faecalis and S. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. Precipitation reactions between S. suis lipoteichoic acid and Group D antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. Reactions between S. bovis phenol extracts and some Group D antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium were not. This may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from S. suis and S. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of S. faecalis.

TI  - Transport and metabolism of vitamin B6 in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis 8043 concentrates extracellular [3H]pyridoxal or [3H]pyridoxamine primarily as the corresponding 5'-phosphates. Accumulation of pyridoxamine requires an exogenous energy source and is inhibited by glycolysis inhibitors. A membrane potential is not required for transport of pyridoxamine, and an artificially generated potential does not drive uptake in this organism. Based on this and other evidence, it is concluded that S. faecalis accumulates pyridoxamine by facilitated diffusion in conjunction with trapping by pyridoxal kinase. Pyridoxamine-P is not concentrated, but equilibrates with that provided externally. Lactobacillus casei 7469 concentrates radioactivity only from pyridoxal, which appears internally as pyridoxal-P, suggesting that it too absorbs the vitamin by facilitated diffusion plus trapping. The specificity of the growth requirement of S. faecalis and L. casei for vitamin B6 parallels the specificity of the transport systems for this vitamin in these organisms. Lactobacillus delbrueckii 7469, however, which specifically requires pyridoxamine-P or pyridoxal-P for growth, accumulates both these compounds and pyridoxine-P from the medium, apparently by active transport, but not pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxal. While pyridoxal-P and pyridoxamine-P are interconvertible in this organism, pyridoxine-P is not further metabolized, thus accounting for the specificity of the growth requirement. These and previous results show (a) that different organisms may employ quite different transport machinery in utilization of a given external nutrient, and (b) that the specificity of the growth requirement for a given form of a vitamin frequently arises from the specificity of transport, but that internal metabolism of the compounds also plays a significant role in some organisms.
TI  - Selective electrode for dibenzyl dimethyl ammonium cation as indicator of the membrane potential in biological systems.
AB  - The electrode sensitive to dibenzyl dimethyl ammonium (DDA+), which is considered to be an indicator of the membrane potential, was constructed by using tetraphenyl borone (TPB-) embedded in dichloroethane. Rapid and Nernstian responses were exhibited against DDA+ solutions ranging between 10(-2) and 3 - 10(-6) M in concentration. High selectivity for DDA+ was observed in the presence of various inorganis salts, ADP, ATP, oxidizable substrates and sugars. The electrode developed here was used to measure the DDA+ uptake in Streptococcus faecalis and the results agreed with those reported by Harold, F.M. and Papineau, D. ((1972) J. Membrane Biol. 8, 27-44 and 45-62). While they determined the DDA+ concentration in the medium by measuring the absorbance of the filtrate treated with the ion-exchangers, the electrode can measure directly the DDA+ concentration in the bacterial suspension without any any pretreatment. It was also shown that the electrode can measure the DDA+ uptake in mitochondria during energization.
TI  - [Dynamics of the establishment of intestinal microflora in healthy full-term newborns].
AB  - A study was made of the dynamics of establishment of the intestinal microflora in 79 healthy mature neonates born of healthy mothers. A total of 223 bacteriological examinations were conducted. A stable prevalence of bifidobacteria over the aerobic portion of the intestinal biocenosis occurred in all the children from the 8th day after birth. Along with this the following bacteria were continuously present in the intestine: lactic bacilli and streptococci E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci; however, their portion in the biocenosis was not great. Bacteroids, microbes of the Proteus genus, and yeast-like fungi were found in the cultures only before the establishment of a high bifidobacteria level. Conditionally pathogenic microorganisms and their associations were continuously revealed in 19.8% of healthy mature neonates. Apparently the qualitative prevalence of bifidobacteria prevented the clinical expression of dysbacteriosis in these children.
TI  - Sorption of Streptococci to glass: Effects of macromolecular solutes.
AB  - Macromolecular solutes (albumin, concanavalin A, whole saliva, serum) caused impaired sorption of Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus sanguis to glass. The inhibitory effect resided chiefly with interactions of the solutes with the glass surface. In the case of sorption of S. sanguis to glass in the presence of parotid fluid, the inhibitory effect was counteracted by a specific attachment of S. sanguis cells mediated by some component(s) of the parotid fluid. Agglutination of the test organisms was in general accompanied by inhibition of sorption. However, when small or unstable aggregates were formed, the number of cells adhering on the glass surface was increased. The findings are discussed with reference to the colonization of teeth by oral bacteria.
TI  - Sorption of Streptococcus faecium to glass.
AB  - A method has been developed by which to study the sorption of Streptococcus faecium to soda-lime cover glasses. Conditions were chosen to minimize the influence on sorption of bacterial polymer production, passive sorption being studied rather than attachment mediated by metabolic activities. Sorption of S. faecium increased with increasing temperature (to 50 degrees C), time, and cell concentration, but equilibrium apparently was not reached even after incubation for 8 hours or at a cell concentration of 3 X 10(10) per ml. Sorption increased with solute molarity up to 0.1 M concentration of NaCl and KCl, indicating an effect of the electrical double layers on the apposition of cells to the glass surface. Desorption of bacteria could be obtained after multiple washings of the glasses in buffer or by the action of Tween 80, but not if sorbed bacteria were left in distilled water, various salt solutions, urea, or in suspensions of unlabelled bacteria. It was concluded that sorption occurred as a result of chemical interactions between the glass and the cell surface. Tween 80 at a concentration of 1 per cent inhibited sorption to 26 per cent of buffer controls, 2 M urea was less effective, and 1 M NaCl was without effect. It is suggested that hydrophobic interactions may be of importance in the binding of S. faecium to glass.
TI  - Serological grouping of streptococci by a slide coagglutination method.
AB  - A new method for the serological grouping of streptococci by coagglutination with specific antibodies absorbed to protein A-containing staphylococci has been assessed. A total of 242 strains of streptococci, including beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, F, and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Strep. faecalis were studied. All streptococci of groups A, B, C, and G, groupable by standard methods, were correctly grouped by coagglutination, although 7-3% showed varying degrees of cross-agglutination. Two beta-haemolytic strains of Strep. faecalis produced coagglutination with group C streptococcal reagent. The method appears to be quick, accurate, reproducible, and simple to perform.
TI  - A simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the Caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  - An efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of Caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. The Caesarean-derived infant Dutch or Japanese-White rabbits and their hybrids (F1; Japanese-White female x Dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, A and B, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (Esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (Table 2) and administered intragastrically once a day through a Nelaton's catheter. Bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. On the third day, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. The weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (Table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of Esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. There was, however, no significant difference milk diet A and B on the weaning rate.

TI  - Evidence that the multi-drug-resistance of Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R is not carried by a plasmid.
AB  - The multi-drug-resistant strain Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R was studied to see  if it carried a plasmid responsible for antibiotic resistance. From results indicating that the antibiotic resistance of S. faecalis BIO-4R was not transferred to recipient bacteria, that the organism did not produce enzymes which inactivated antibiotics, and that the presence of covalently closed circular DNA was not demonstrated by dye-cesium chloride buoyant density gradient centrifugation, it was concluded that the organism did not carry such a plasmid. Studies on polyphenylalanine synthesis by cell-free extracts of the oganism showed that its ribosomes were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin and kanamycin. These results, although rather indirectly, support the above notion that the multi-drug-resistance of S. faecalis BIO-4R is not mediated by a plasmid.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a small sequence located at two sites on the amplifiable tetracycline resistance plasmid pAMalpha1 in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis DT-11 harbors the 6.0-megadalton plasmid pAMalpha1, which  determines resistance to tetracycline (TC). When this strain is grown in the presence of TC for a number of generations, a reversible gene amplification occurs, generating tandem repeats of a 2.65-megadalton segment of the plasmid. On the basis of heteroduplex studies between various forms of pAMalpha1 and fragments generated by the Escherichia coli restriction endonuclease EcoRI, we have obtained direct evidence for the presence of a small sequence designated RS1 (for recombination sequence) located on both sides of the TC resistance determinant. Corresponding points on the two sequences are separated by 2.65 megadaltons of deoxyribonucleic acid. The two RS1 sequences have the same polarity and are of a size corresponding to about 380 nucleotide base pairs. The data presented serve as strong support for amplification models that are based on recombinational events involving the RS1 sequences.
TI  - Casein degradation and amino acid liberation in milk by two highly proteolytic strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Amongst 100 isolates of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus feacalis proved to be highly proteolytic as demonstrated by starch gel electrophoresis and liberation of various amino acids. Both these organisms hydrolysed casein differently to produce different concentrations of amino acids.
TI  - Acid production from Lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - The acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (Lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mitior, S. milleri, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, Lactobacillus casei and L. salivarius. The polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 7 days after which the pH was recorded. Maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). Lycasin was fermented by all strains of S. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the S. sanguis strains, about one third of the S. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. Acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the S. mutans strains and the S. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. Sorbitol-fermenting strains of S. sanguis and of S. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. No other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. Only the reference strains L. salivarius subsp. salivarius ATCC 11741 and S. avium ATCC 14025 fermented xylitol.
TI  - [Bacterial endocarditis: clinical and bacteriological aspects and prognostic factors].
AB  - The microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the Hopital cantonal, Geneva, between August 1970 and October 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. The pathogenic role of S. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. When defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. Many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. An unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main therapeutic problem. Thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. Finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. This clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.
TI  - Resistance mechanism of chloramphenicol in Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance of Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis isolated from clinical materials was proved to be due to an inactivating enzyme produced by these bacteria. The inactivated products of chloramphenicol were identified as 1-acetoxy, 3-acetoxy and 1,3-diacetoxy derivatives by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The responsible enzyme was thus confirmed to be chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The enzyme was inducible. It was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The enzymes obtained from S. haemolyticus, S. pneumoniae and S. faecalis have been compared with the conclusion that they are identical with respect to molecular weight (approximately 75,000-80,000), optimum pH and heat stability.
TI  - Biosynthesis of ribothymidine in the transfer RNA of Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. A methylation of RNA involving 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.
AB  - The methyl moiety of ribothymidine in the tRNA of Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and probably Bacillus cereus is dervied from a 1-carbon folate derivative and not S-adenosylmethionine. Micrococcus luteus (M. lysodeikticus) tRNA appears to be almost devoid of ribothymidine. S. faecalis tRNA lacking ribothymidine can be methylated in vitro with formation of ribothymidine. 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate has been identified as the 1-carbon donor involved in ribothymidine formation in S. faecalis and implicated in the analogous reaction in B. subtilis. The reaction requires FADH2 and/or another reducing agent present in cell extracts for the reduction of the methylene moiety.

TI  - Proteolytic activity of Streptococcus mutans (GS-5).
AB  - The potential proteolytic ability of cariogenic streptococci was assessed in a strain of Streptococcus mutans (GS-5). Blood-borne S. mutans from rats infected by mouth with GS-5 were cultured, and sterile rat tail tendons were placed on these cultured bacterial colonies. The collagenolytic ability of these organisms was examined under the scanning electron microscope and by testing for reduced tensile strength of the collagen fibers. These experiments showed that GS-5 cariogenic streptococcus can be conditioned to produce significant collagenolytic activity.
TI  - A unifying concept for the active site region in aspartate transcarbamylase.
AB  - Recent investigations on the aspartate transcarbamylases (carbamoylphosphate:L-aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2.1.3.2) of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis indicate that there is a site on each enzyme, apart from the active site, at which anions can bind. It is suggested in this paper that the location of such an anion binding site on the E. coli enzyme may be directly adjacent to the part of the active site at which carbamyl phosphate binds. This hypothesis is based on data demonstrating a lack of correlation between spectral changes and kinetic effects, and on a new interpretation of results obtained with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, which has previously been considered to act as a transition state analogue. Such a hypothesis could explain other puzzling observations made on the catalytic subunit of this enzyme, including the dependence of substrate inhibition by aspartate on the nature of the second substrate, and the ease of formation of a dead-end enzyme-aspartate-carbamyl-aspartate complex.
TI  - Partial purification of Streptococcus faecalis chain disrupting system by gel filtration.

The Gram staining reveals random sites of the lytic activity in the chains indicated by the presence of Gram-negative lysing cocci within a single chain.
TI  - A Rapid, simple method for demonstrating synergy of amikacin and penicillin against various microorganisms.
AB  - A simple disk diffusion technique with use of triple-layer agar and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin demonstrated synergy between penicillins and aminoglycosides. The method was applied to measurement of the synergistic activity of amikacin and penicillin G against a strain of Streptococcus faecalis sensitive to both drugs, amikacin and ampicillin against a strain of S. faecalis sensitive to amplicillin but resistant to amikacin, and amikacin and carbenicillin against a strain of Proteus mirabilis sensitive to both drugs. The degree of synergy was related to the specific organism tested. For example, syngery of penicillin G and amikacin for S. faecalis could be demonstrated only when the organism was subjected first to the action of penicillin G alone. In addition to providing useful clinical information, the triple-layer technique appears to be a promising tool for the study and understanding of synergy between antimicrobial agents.

AB  - A comparative study of ultrastructure and IR-spectroscopy of osmotic shock membranes from cells of glycolyzing (Streptococcus faecalis) and respiring (Micrococcus lysodeikticus) bacteria, was made. The S. faecalis and M. lysodeikticus membranes differ in their cross-section. Treatment of the preliminary washed membranes of S. faecalis and M. lysodeikticus with a low ionic strength solution removes 40% and 70% of their proteins respectively, decreases the membrane cross-section but does not change their fracture faces. Pre-cooling of the membrane suspensions within the temperature range of +5 degrees-10 degrees results in the appearance of large smooth areas on S. faecalis membrane fracture faces, but does not affect the ones of M. lysodeikticus membrane. Treatment of the washed suspensions with Triton X-100 results in the appearance of drastic changes of S. faecalis membrane fracture faces and does not change the fracture faces of M. lysodeikticus membranes; treatment by the detergent does not alter the IR-spectroscopy of membranes of both bacteria. Treatment of S. faecalis and M. lysodeikticus membranes with high temperature irreversibly changes the structure of 20% and 40% of protein components respectively,, but does not affect the distribution of the subparticles on their fracture faces. It is assumed that the differences found are determined by the composition of lipid components of the membranes studied and that the amount of proteins closely bound with lipids in the membranes of S. faecalis is likely to be greater than that of M. lysodeikticus membranes.

AB  - Changes in the phospholipids of the membrane of L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis were studied after exposure to normal human serum. The phospholipids were labeled by incubating the L forms with [14C]palmitate. After the reaction of the L-forms with normal human serum, the percentage of total lipid radioactivity decreased in phospholipids and increased in free fatty acids, indicating phospholipase activity. Similar changes were seen on reacting normal human serum with autoclaved L-forms. Sonication of the L-forms resulted in only a slight increase in phospholipase activity. These results suggested that a major part of the phospholipase activity was in the serum.
TI  - Selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of Streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Hot saline extracts of Streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. Chromatography of the extract of S. mutans strain MT703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column gave two principal antigens. One antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. The other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. It was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (PGP) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes and/or S. mutans strain Ingbritt (type c). The PGP antigen was further purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75. Two peaks, PGP-1, and PGP-2, were obtained. Each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-PGP serum as shown by immunodiffusion. Chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. PGP antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. However, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of PGP. The PGP in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity. The addition of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting PGP antigen. After adsorption of the extract from S. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and PGP antigens were absorbed with the resin. This simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the PGP-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
TI  - Fecal indicator bacteria persistence under natural conditions in an ice-covered river.
AB  - Total coliform (TC), fecal coliform (FC), and fecal streptococcus (FS) survival characteristics, under natural conditions at 0 degrees C in an ice-covered river, were examined during February and March 1975. The membrane filter (MF) technique was used throughout the study, and the multiple-tube (MPN) method was used in parallel on three preselected days for comparative recovery of these bacteria. Survival was studied at seven sample stations downstream from all domestic pollution sources in a 317-km reach of the river having 7.1 days mean flow time (range of 6.0 to 9.1 days). The mean indicator bacteria densities decreased continuously at successive stations in this reach and, after adjustment for dilution, the most rapid die-off was found to occur during the first 1.9 days, followed by a slower decrease. After 7.1 days, the relative survival was TC less than FC less than FS, with 8.4%, 15.7%, and 32.8% of the initial populations remaining viable, respectively. These rates are higher than previously reported and suggest that the highest survival rates for these bacteria in receiving streams can be expected at 0 degree C under ice cover. Additionally, the FC-FS ratio was greater than 5 at all stations, indicating that this ratio may be useable for determining the source of fecal pollution in receiving streams for greater than 7 days flow time at low water temperatures. The MPN and MF methods gave comparable results for the TC and FS at all seven sample stations, with both the direct and verified MF counts within the 95% confidence limits of the respective MPNs in most samples, but generally lower than the MPN index. Although FC recovery on membrane filters was comparable results at stations near the pollution source. However, the results became more comparable with increasing flow time. The results of this study indicate that heat shock is a major factor in suppression of the FC counts on the membrane filters at 44.5 degree C. Heat shock may be minimized by extended incubation at 35 degrees C before exposure to the higher temperature.
TI  - Inhibition of Streptococcus faecalis by long chain aliphatic monoamines: quantitative structure-activity studies.
AB  - Primary, secondary, and tertiary long chain aliphatic amines were synthesized, and their activity against Streptococcus faecalis was determined. Quantitative structure-activity analyses were carried out based on the Hansch extrathermodynamic model, using partition coefficients, CMC's, quantum mechanical charges on the amine nitrogen, and the Taft steric parameter. The best correlations were obtained with the CMC. Steric properties of the ammonium head become important for tertiary amines. The structural feature of these compounds that dominates biological activity is the length of the alkyl tail. Ammonium head substituents are of only secondary importance.
TI  - Antagonistic action of Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus faecalis to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus faecalis were found to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on Lowenstein-Jensen and Middlebrook 7H11 agars, but not on the latter medium when antibacterial drugs were added. S. faecalis was found to be more inhibitory than S. salivarius to 15 strains of M. tuberculosis. S. salivarius produced little or no inhibition of growth of Runyon group III organisms but was very antagonistic to Runyon group I mycobacteria.
TI  - Transformation of Streptococcus sanguis Challis by plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid  from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from Streptococcus faecalis, strain DS5, was  transferred to the Challis strain of Streptococcus sanguis by transformation. Two antibiotic resistance markers carried by the beta plasmid from strain DS5, erythromycin and lincomycin, were transferred to S. sanguis at a maximum frequency of 1.8 x 10-5/colony-forming unit. Approximately 70% of the covalently closed circular DNA isolated from transformant cultures by dye buoyant density gradients was shown to be hybridizable to beta plasmid DNA. Two major differences were observed between the beta plasmid from S. faecalis and the plasmid isolated from transformed S. sanguis: (i) the beta plasmid from strain DS5 sedimented in velocity gradients at 43S, whereas the covalently closed circular DNA from transformed Challis sedimented at 41S, suggesting a 1.5-Mdal deletion from the beta plasmid occurred; (ii) although the 43S beta plasmid remained in the supercoiled configuration for several weeks after isolation, the 41S plasmid was rapidly converted to a linear double-stranded molecule. Attempts to transform S. sanguis with the alpha plasmid from S. faecalis, strain DS5, were unsuccessful.
TI  - Monomer addition as a mechanism of forming peptide cross-links in the cell-wall peptidoglycan of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790.
AB  - The relative amounts of radioactively labelled disaccharide-peptide monomers and  peptide-cross-linked dimers and trimers found in the peptidoglycan of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were compared to the relative amounts to be expected from two different polymerization mechanisms (random condensation and monomer addition). Data from continuously-labeled, exponentially-growing cells are consistent with a monomer addition cross-linking process, not with a random condensation cross-linking mechanism. This conclusion was supported by data obtained from analyses of cells labeled during valine starvation (and wall thickening), recovery from valine starvation, and pulse and pulse-chase labeling of walls from exponentially-growing cultures.
TI  - Effect of lipoteichoic acid and lipids on lysis of intact cells of Streptococcus  faecalis.
AB  - Autolysis of intact cells of Streptococcus faecalis was inhibited to a greater extent by phospholipids than by lipoteichoic acid, suggesting a possible difference in the accessibility of native autolysin to these substances.
TI  - Autolytic formation of protoplasts (autoplasts) of Streptococcus faecalis; location of active and latent autolysin.
AB  - Over 80% of the active and porteinase-activatable, latent forms of the autolytic  N-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were released to the supernatant buffer during the autolytic formation of protoplasts (autoplasts) in the presence of absence of trypsin. Autolysin activity was not found in association with released mesosomal vesicles and had little affinity for binding to membranes or to the outer surface of the wall. Isolated walls were able to bind over four times as much autolysin activity as that present on wall exponential-phase cells. Using a rapid technique for wall isolation, evidence was obtained that the latent form (as well as the active form) was wall bound in intact cells. In addition, isotope labeling and ultrastructural studies were able to show that latent autolysin was concentrated in the newer, septally associated portion of the wall.
TI  - Study of cycle of cell wall assembly in Streptococcus faecalis by three-dimensional reconstructions of thin sections of cells.
AB  - A new ultrastructural method was used to study rounds of envelope synthesis that  occur in Streptococcus faecalis in "growth zones" found between pairs of naturally occurring surface markers. The technique consists of producing three-dimensional reconstructions of these growth zones from the mathematical rotation, about a central axis, of measurements taken from central, longitudinal thin sections of cells. A cycle of exponential-phase envelope growth was then simulated by arranging a series of these reconstructions in increasing order of the amount of peripheral wall surface area or the amount of cell volume that each was calculated to contain. Using this simulated cycle of growth, the geometry of a single growth zone during a round of synthesis was studied. Based on this analysis, a model was developed for the assembly of the cell wall of S. faecalis. The model states that new cell wall surface is synthesized by the regulated flow of essentially two channels of cell wall precursors into a single growth zone. One channel of precursors would be involved in the assembly of a bilayered cross wall that would proceed at a fairly constant rate until the cross wall closes. The second channel of precursors would be involved in the separation of the bilayered cross wall into two segments of peripheral wall. These precursors would intercalate into and thicken the separating layers of the cross wall. The flow of precursors through this channel would be progressively reduced through a cycle. These decreases, when coupled with internal hydrostatic pressure, apparently would result in the enlarging peripheral wall becoming increasingly more curved and would also promote cell division by reducing the total amount of cell wall that must be assembled in order for septation to occur.
TI  - Three-dimensional reconstruction of whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis from thin sections of cells.
AB  - A new ultrastructural technique has been developed to study the geometry of cell  wall assembly in Streptococcus faecalis, which is believed to occur between pairs of raised bands located on the organism's surface. Three-dimensional reconstructions of these new regions of envelope growth are produced from the mathematical rotation (around a central axis) of various measurements taken from central, longitudinal thin sections of cells. These reconstructions can be used to calculate the surface area and volume of the septal and peripheral walls that were supposedly present in any given cell before sectioning. In an accompanying paper, it is shown how such surface and volume estimations, coupled with other measurements of length, thickness, and curvature, can be used to characterize a cycle of envelope growth in this organism. The validity of the assumptions used to reconstruct cells by rotation and the possible sources of error in using this technique are discussed.
TI  - Comparison of chemical and microbiological methods in the estimation of methionine in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) seeds.
AB  - 1. Meals were prepared from the seeds of fifteen varieties of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), one of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and one of yam bean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa), and their methionine content was determined by six different methods. 2. Total methionine content was determined by two chemical methods (ion-exchange chromatography and a colorimetric procedure) and by two microbiological methods. The 'available' methionine content was determined by microbiological assay with Streptococcus zymogenes. 3. All the different methods for total methionine determination gave similar results, with much the same high extent of precision. 4. The value for 'available' methionine content were similar to or marginally higher than the corresponding microbiological assay value for total methionine content. There was no indication that the methionine in any of the test samples was not completely available.
TI  - Effects of phenethyl alcohol on Bacillus and Streptococcus.
AB  - The activity of phenethyl alcohol (PEA) on Bacillus cereus, B. megaterium, and Streptococcus faecalis was studied by electron microscopy of thin sections and by the assay of intracellular K+ leakage. S. faecalis was unaffected by PEA at concentrations up to 0.5%, B. cereus was severely damaged by 0.5% PEA, and B. megaterium behaved intermediately. Important membrane ultrastructural alterations were observed in B. cereus cells treated with 0.5% PEA, namely the change in the geometry of the membrane profile from asymmetric to symmetric, the occurrence of prominent, complex mesosome-like structures, and membrane fracturing and solubilization. Protoplasts from B. megaterium were found to be quickly lysed by 0.5% PEA due to the disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. The electron microscopic observations, together with the results of the study of the K+ efflux from B. cereus and B. megaterium, indicate that PEA primarily and directly damages the cytoplasmic membrane of sensitive bacteria. The breakdown of the permeability barrier probably is responsible for the observed bactericidal action of 0.5% PEA on B. cereus.
TI  - Bacterial mesosomes. Real structures or artifacts?
AB  - The ultrastructural study of membrane organization in gram-positive bacteria related to the OSO4 fixation conditions revealed that large, complex mesosomes are observed only when the bacteria are subjected to an initial fixation with 0.1%OSO4 in the culture broth, as in the prefixation step of the Ryter-Kellenberger procedure. Evidence was obtained suggesting that the large mesosomes are produced by this prefization. The kinetic study of the membrane morphological alterations occurring during the prefixation of Bacillus cereus with 0.1%OSO4 in the culture broth showed that the amount of mesosome material increases linearly from zero to a maximum observed at 1.7 min of prefixation and that at about this time a maximum is reached for the number of mesosomes per unity of cell area and for the average individual mesosome area. The large mesosomes observed in gram-positives fixed by the complete Ryter-Kellenberger procedure would be the result of the membrane-damaging action of 0.1%OSO4. Such damaging action was deduced from the observation thay 0.1%OSO4 quickly lyses protoplasts and induces a quick and extensive leakage of intracellular K+ from B. cereus and Streptococcus faecalis. In support of that interpretation is the observation that in bacteria subjected to several membrane-damaging treatments, mesosome-like structures are seen after three different fixation procedures. In bacteria initially fixed with 1% OSO4, 4% OSO4 or 2.5% glutaraldehyde, no large complex mesosomes are observed, small and simple invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane being present. The size of these minute mesosomes is inversely proportional that causes of fixation. Uranyl acetate was found among the studied fixatives the one to the rate the least damage to bacterial membranes. This fixative satisfactorily preserves protoplasts. In bacteria initially fixed with uranyl acetate no mesosomes were found. The results of the present work throw serious doubts on the existence of mesosomes, both large and small, as real structures of bacterial cells. It is proposed that a continuous cytoplasmic membrane without infoldings (mesosomes) would be the real pattern of membrane organization in gram-positives.
TI  - Sequence characterization of 5S ribosomal RNA from eight gram positive procaryotes.
AB  - The available comparative data on procaryotic 5S rRNA was extended through sequencing studies of eight gram positive procaryotes. Complete nucleotide sequences were presented for 5S rRNA from Bacillus subtilis, B. firmus, B. pasteurii, B. brevis, Lactobacillus brevis and Streptococcus faecalis. In addition, 5S rRNA oligonucleotide catalogs and partial sequence data were provided for B. cereus and Sporosarcina ureae. These sequences and catalogs were discussed in terms of known features of procaryotic 5S rRNA architecture.
TI  - Susceptibility of Streptococcus faecalis to 32 antimicrobial agents. Comparison of patterns in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany.
AB  - Two hundred and twenty strains of Streptococcus faecalis (103 isolated in Poland  and 117 in Federal Republic of Germany), were tested for antibiotic-susceptibility to 32 antimicrobial agents by agar dilution technique. Most effective in vitro appeared ampicillin, penicillin G, and a combination (1:1) of penicillin and streptomycin. Partly effective were also macrolide antibiotics, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole and five tetracyclines. Other antibiotics, including five cephalosporin derivatives, five aminoglycoside antibiotics, two lincomycins, two polymyxins, chloramphenicol and fucidin, appeared practically ineffective in vitro. Effectiveness of antimicrobials in vitro was considered on the basis of standard bioavailability of antimicrobial agents. No differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns of any practical significance were found, when strains isolated in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany were compared.

TI  - Rapid specific identification of group D streptococci by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group D streptococci have been examined by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to determine if this method might be of value in the rapid identification of the members of this group. Group D organisms identified by classical biochemical and serologic procedures were inoculated into Todd Hewitt broth and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 4 hours of incubation, free group D streptococcal antigen was detected in broth cultures from 70 of 70 group D enterococcal strains. Precipitin lines were readily visible immediately after electrophoresis in each case. In contrast, 10 nonenterococcal group D strains failed to produce detectable free group D antigen in the Todd Hewitt broth after 4, 24, or 48 hours incubation. Such antigen was detectable, however, after 48 hours incubation in Mueller Hinton broth containing 10 grams of glucose per liter. Representative strains of group A, C, G, and B streptococi, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pneumoniae grown in Todd-Hewitt broth for 4 hours gave no precipitin lines when reacted against adsorbed monospecific group D antiserum. Group D antigen was also detected in broth cultures of direct swabs and in 18-hour blood culture broths. CIE appears to be a rapid and sensitive procedure for identification of the enterococcal strains of group D streptococci from clinical isolates.
TI  - Cation exchange in cell walls of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The relative affinities of various cations for anionic sites in isolated, bacterial cell walls were assessed by means of a technique involving displacement of one cation by another. The affinity series determined was H+ greater than La3+ greater than Cd2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+ greater than K+ greater than Na+ greater than Li+. High affinity was correlated with low mobility of the bound ions in an electric field. The net cation-exchange capacities of walls isolated from a variety of bacteria were estimated by preparing the magnesium forms of the walls, washing them well with deionized water to remove supernumerary ions, and then completely displacing the magnesium with Na+ or H+. Total amounts of magnesium displaced varied from 73 mumol per gram dry weight, for walls of the teichoic acid-deficient 52A5 strain of Staphylococcus aureus to about 520 mumol per gram for Bacillus megaterium KM walls....
TI  - Pyelonephritis. XIX. Immunization against enterococcal pyelonephritis.
AB  - A study has been done of immunization against Streptococcus faecalis pyelonephritis in the rat. Intravenous, subcutaneous, and bladder immunizations were tested with intravenous and retrograde challenge. Logarithmic and stationary growth phase organisms were used separately for both immunization and challenge. The only instance of significant, but incomplete, protection was in animals immunized subcutaneously or intravenously and challenged intravenously with log phase organisms. No correlation was found between circulating antibody response and infection. Serum bactericidal activity was not increased by immunization or infection.
TI  - [Energization of membrane vesicles from the cells of glycolyzing bacterium Streptococcus faecalis].
AB  - Membrane fractions were isolated from Streptococcus faecalis cells of a glycolyzing microorganism, devoid of the respiratory chain, using the methods of osmotic shock of the protoplasts, ultrasonic treatment of the cells and ultrasonic treatment of the protoplasts. All fractions possessed the ATPase activity, the highest activity being observed in the fraction isolated by ultrasonication of the protoplasts. All preparations were estimated with respect to the presence of vesicles, formed by the "inside-out" and "inside-in" membranes, using ATPase as a marker of the membrane orientation. In the membrane fractions obtained by ultrasonication of the protoplasts, the "inside-out" vesicles were prevalent. ATP-dependent energization of the membranes, sensitive to the action of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and tetrachlorotrifluoromethyl benzimidazole, was demonstrated by measuring the transport of the lipophylic anion of phenyldicarbaundecaborane and aniline naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence.
TI  - Bactericidal mechanisms in rabbit alveolar macrophages: evidence against peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The role of peroxidase-mediated bacterial killing by rabbit alveolar macrophages  was examined. During 3 h of incubation in vitro, alveolar macrophages ingested and killed greater than 88% of the Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae present in the incubation mixture. Preincubation of alveolar macrophages with inhibitors of catalase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or sodium nitrite, did not alter their bactericidal potential. Iodination of ingested zymosan particles, a peroxidase-dependent and hydrogen peroxide-dependent reaction, was not observed, in spite of vigorous phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, iodination by alveolar macrophages was not significantly increased when peroxidase-coated zymosan particles were ingested. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide may not be available to the phagocytic vacuole for microbial killing. Since tetrazolium dye reduction reflects the activity of an oxidase responsible for stimulated oxygen consumption by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, this reaction was also measured. Rabbit alveolar macrophages incubated with latex particles did not exhibit an increased dye reduction compared with resting cells. The absence of significant stimulation of tetrazolium dye reduction indicates that the oxidase reaction does not occur in the proximity of the phagocytic vacuole of alveolar macrophages.
TI  - Microorganisms responsible for controlling the populations of Escherichia coli and enterococcus and the consistency of cecal contents in the chicken.
AB  - A study was made to clarify what kinds of intestinal organisms might be responsible for controlling the populations of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens in the cecum and the consistency of the cecal of chickens. Germ-free chickens were inoculated orally with various mixtures of bacterial cultures alone or in combination, different dilutions of the cecal contents of chickens, different dilutions of the cecal contents treated by healing or with chloroform, the supernatant of diluted cecal contents, and dilutions of human feces. Factors controlling the E. Coli populations, enterococcal populations, and consistency of the cecal contents were shown to be independent of one another. The ecosystem controlling the E. coli or enterscoccal population was more complex than that controlling the consistency of the cecal contents. The former was composed of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria isolated and heat- or chloroform-resistance organisms, and the latter of heat- or chloroform-resistance alone, which were inferred not to prevailing in the cecal contents of chickens. Discussion is made on ecological systems controlling flora.

TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Nonspecific complement activation by streptococcal structures. II. Properdin-independent initiation of the alternate pathway.
AB  - Complement consumption by isolated membranes and walls from Group A streptococci  and various other gram-positive microbes has been tested. These microbial structures were found to activate the alternate complement pathway. However, unlike endotoxin, inulin, or other plant polysaccharides, activation of complement by our material was found to bypass properdin. The activating factor(s) also differs from cobra venom in its/their requirement for factor D. Preliminary experiments suggest this factor isolated from membranes to be a protein and to have a mol wt greater than 40-60,000 daltons. Our studies have led us to speculate that the phylogenetic role of the alternate complement pathway may be the primordial nonspecific defense system which has retained certain fundamental aspects up to the present time.
TI  - Nonspecific complement activation by streptococcal structures. I. Re-evaluation of HLA cytotoxicity inhibition.
AB  - A number of experiments have suggested that there is an antigenic relationship between the HLA complex and streptococcal bacterial structures. Using inhibition of cytotoxicity of HLA antisera as our assay system, it was demonstrated that the inhibitory effect on HLA cytotoxicity by streptococcal antigens is, in reality, due to activation and consumption of components of the alternate complement pathway. In addition, antisera prepared against streptococcal membrane antigens had no cytotoxic effect on a large panel of human lymphocytes, nor did these antisera exhibit immunofluorescent staining of lymphocytes directly. These experiments are compatible with our concept that the HLA complex may have evolved through selective evolutionary pressure as a means of escaping bacterial mimicry.
TI  - The cleaning and disinfection by heat of bedpans in automatic and semi-automatic  machines.
AB  - This work is concerned with the cleaning and disinfection by heat of stainless-steel and polypropylene bedpans, which had been soiled with either a biological contaminant, human serum albumin (HSA) labelled with technetium-99m 99m(Tc), or a bacteriological contaminant, streptococcus faecalis mixed with Tc-labelled HSA. Results of cleaning and disinfection achieved with a Test Machine and those achieved by procedures adopted in eight different wards of a general hospital are reported. Bedpan washers installed in wards were found to be less efficient than the Test Machine, at least partly because of inadequate maintenance. Stainless-steel and polypropylene bedpans gave essentially the same results.

TI  - A hitherto unknown streptococcal antigen and its probable relation to acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
AB  - In the initial phase of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (AGN), antigenic sites not covered by specific antibody can be demonstrated in the glomeruli. These sites are on the endothelial side of the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangial matrix. The antigen is contained in a water-soluble fraction of nephritogenic streptococci. It can be highly purified by column chromatography or acrylamide electrophoresis. This antigen against which the patient develops specific antibodies is contained and immunologically identical in all nephriotogenic streptococci examined so far irrespective of their M or T protein. It is not identical with any known streptococcal extracellular product. When antibodies are produced in rabbits against this streptococcal antigen they localize on kidney biopsies, obtained early during the disease from patients with AGN in an identical way as does the labelled antibody of the serum of patients wiht AGN. This antigen may be suited as a vaccine for the prevention of AGN.

TI  - Evaluation of Pfizer selective enterococcus and KF media for recovery of fecal streptococci from water by membrane filtration.
AB  - Pfizer selective enterococcus (PSE) and KF agars were compared for their recovery of fecal streptococci from sewage effluent on membrane filters. The results showed that PSE agar is highly selective for the enterococci. The tan color resulting from esculin hydrolysis, which was not always visible on the surfaces of the colonies, is not considered a necessary differential characteristic on PSE agar since more than 90% of all colonies recovered on membrane filters were confirmed as fecal streptococci and 86% were confirmed as enterococci. The detection of esculin hydrolysis on membrane filters was not improved by using the new Millipore type HC filter. KF agar recovered significantly greater numbers of organisms but was not as selective, with 83% of the typical colonies being confirmed as fecal streptococci and 54% as enterococci. An attempt to improve the selectivity of KF agar while retaining its inclusiveness by incubation at 45 C was not successful.
TI  - Turbidimetric and diffusion assay of bacitracin in feeds.
AB  - A manual turbidimetric method for determining zinc or methylene disalicylate bacitracin in feeds was developed. When zinc ions (10-4M) were added to the medium and the phosphate ion concentration in standard solutions was decreased to 1%, the median response of Streptococcus faecalis was about 0.038 unit. Feeds analyzed by the turbidimetric assay should be prewashed with petroleum ether and extracted with pyridine as in 42.204. Zinc bacitracin standards added to swine and broiler rations were recovered at 93.1-102.6% by the turbidimetric method. Excellent agreement between the manual turbidimetric method and the plate assay was also obtained for finished feeds containing the zinc or methylene disalicylate salt of the antibiotic. The turbidimetric method appears to have high accuracy and precision. It is more rapid and less costly than the plate assay.
TI  - An improved procedure for the assay of available lysine and methionine in feedstuffs using Tetrahymena pyriformis W.
AB  - 1. A study was made of the assay of available lysine and available methionine using Tetrahymena pyriformis W, as applied to a variety of protein-rich feedstuffs. 2. Results were strongly influenced by the conditions under which the analyses were done. With most of the test samples predigestion with papain caused a large increase in the values obtained. 3. An improved assay procedure was developed which included enzymic predigestion of the test samples, "all-in" sterilization of the medium constituents, and measurement of growth from extinction values. It gave results for available lysine that were broadly similar to those obtained in growth tests with rats, and in chemical tests by the method of Carpenter (1960). Values for available methionine agreed closely with those obtained in microbiological tests with Streptococcus zymogenes.

TI  - Streptococci isolated from bovine intramammary infections.
AB  - Streptococcal isolates from 71 dairy herds considered free of Streptococcus agalactiae were compared with isolates from 1 herd used in bovine mastitis research over a 12-year period. The incidence of streptococci was as follows: Streptococcus uberis, 56.5%; enterococci, 24.2%; Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 9.0%; Streptococcus bovis, 5.1%; unclassified streptococci, 3.1%; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1.5%; and Lancefield group G streptococci, 0.7%. The incidence for these streptococci in the 2 groups was generally the same except for Str bovis and unclassified streptococci. A study of cultural responses in numerous mediums indicated that differentiation of streptococci recovered from the bovine udder may be obtained with esculin broth, CAMP test, sodium hippurate broth, 0.1% methylene blue milk, inulin, and raffinose broths.
TI  - Inhibition of wall autolysis in Streptococcus faecalis by lipoteichoic acid and lipids.
AB  - Fully acylated lipoteichoic acid (LTA) isolated from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC9790 (S. faecium) inhibited autolysis of walls from the same organism at concentrations (1.0 to 1.5 nmol of LTA per mg of wall) comparable to those found in intact cells. Partially deacylated LTA isolated from S. faecalis or chemically deacylated LTA failed to inhibit significantly in the same concentration range. Beef heart cardiolipin and commercially obtained dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl glycerol were also found to inhibit wall autolysis in S. faecalis. Chemical deacylation of beef heart cardiolipin also removed the inhibitory activity of this molecule. Lipid fractions isolated from S. faecalis that inhibited wall autolysis were: diphosphatidyl glycerol (cardiolipin), phosphatidyl glycerol, aminoacyl phosphatidyl glycerol, and a neutral lipid fraction. Glycolipids were not found to be effective inhibitors. The possible role of LTA and/or certain lipids as regulators of cellular autolytic activity is discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.

TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Aquatic indicator bacteria in the high alpine zone.
AB  - Selected waters from the high alpine zone within Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, were analyzed for populations of indicator bacteria during the past three summers to determine the influence of various factors on the quality of these waters. In general the water quality was not significantly influenced by the presence or absence of human visitors but rather by the nature of the biological community through which the streams flowed. A minority of the coliforms that were recovered from all of the sites proved to be fecal coliforms. The fecal streptococci isolated were identified as the species that were found primarily in the fecal material of the native rodent and moose populations. It is concluded that management questions that relate to the carrying capacity of alpine areas should be approached with the aid of other biological parameters along with levels of indicator bacteria in the streams.
TI  - On the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
AB  - Cell division by strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-DU). Division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. Recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-DU and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline pH. Growth with 5-DU caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of S. typhimurium. The agent caused chaining in Streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of S. typhimurium. These effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. The most marked effect of 5-DU on S. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of DNA synthesis. Since 5-DU did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of DNA replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-DU than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-DU acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on DNA replication.

AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
TI  - [Enzymatic preparation of peptides of the general type: L-Ala-D-Glu-L-mesodiaminopimelyl (L)-D (140) Ala by transfer reactions between non radioactive corresponding peptides and D-alanine (140)].
AB  - Membrane bound LD-transpeptidase of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 was used to  catalyse transpeptidation reactions between non radioactive peptide donors of the general type: L-Ala-D-Glu (L)meso-A2pm(L)-D-Ala and D-(14C) alanine acceptor. The presence of one or two amide residues on the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and meso-diaminopimelic acid increases the transfer reactions and subsequently the yield in radioactive peptides L-Ala-D-Glu (L)meso-A2pm(L)-D-(14C) Ala.
TI  - [Biochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of the membranes of Streptococcus faecalis].
AB  - It is demonstrated by thin-section that S. faecalis cells (Strain BKM-B6) have no inner membranes, and their plasma membranes do not show any invagination into the cytoplasm. It is established that B and A fracture faces of the membranes in the intact bacteria, protoplasts, osmotic shock and sonicated membrane fractions contain uniformly distributed particles with a density of 200--400 and 4000--5000 particles/mu m2, respectively. Washing of the osmotic shock membrane fraction with a buffer solution of 0.25 M tris-SO4 with 2 M LiCl removes 35--40% of non-membrane proteins. Further washing (repeated 3 times) of the fraction with 0.001 M tris-SO4 removes additionally 40% of the protein, decreases the ATPase activity by 80%, and slightly decreases the cross-section of the membranes, but it does not affect of their A and B fracture faces. The membrane fracture faces A in all fractions exhibit small areas with tetragonally packed particles (with a tetragon size of 150 A X 150 A and a density of 20000--22000 particles/mu m2). These areas seem to be responsible for changing in the isolated membrane properties. Treatment of the washed membrane fractions with 0.2% triton X-100 results in a decrease of the vesicle sizes and appearance of drastic changes of their fracture faces. Changes of the membrane fracture faces under the action of triton X-100 are likely to be due to a breakdown in the hydrophobic interaction between the protein and lipid components. As it is shown by freez-fracturing technique, osmotic shock and sonicated membrane fractions contain 95% and 50% of rightside-out vesicles. It correlates with biochemical data on the membrane orientation of vesicles in different fractions.
TI  - [Find of enterococci in sour cream and butter].
AB  - Studied was the enterococcus count in cream intended for the production of butter. It was found that in about 33 per cent of the cream samples the enterococcus titer varies within the 0.1+range, and in 66 per cent it is 0.01, up to and below 0.0001. It was likewise established that after the churning process is over and after the washing of the butter product more than 90 per cent of the enterococcus microflora has passed into the buttermilk and the waste water. The enterococcus count in the butter was found to be limited: 93 per cent of the butter samples have 0.1 and higher titers, and at least 7 per cent of them are with titers ranging from 0.01 up to 0.001. Prevailing are ususally the species of the fecalis group and in the first place Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens. Suggested are standard norms concerning the admissible numbers of Enterococcus bacteria in butter. For example, superior quality butter should have a titer of 1, and first quality butter --0.1.

TI  - The effect of cooling and warming rates on the survival of a variety of bacteria.
AB  - Cooling and warming rates affect bacterial survival profoundly with all bacteria  tested (Azotobacter chroococcum, Klebsiella aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis) behaving similarly. Most bacteria were sensitive to salt on freezing and thawing. Viabilities of population frozen and thawed in saline were always less (by at least 20%) than comparable ones frozen in water alone. Under these conditions, S. faecalis was resistant to the presence of sodium chloride; viabilities of populations frozen in the presence or absence of sodium chloride were always less than 5% different. The implications of these results in light of the organisms' shape, Gram stain, and respiration are discussed.
TI  - Selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. Streptococcus salivarius and S. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (Charles River strain). S. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. The ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. S. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of S. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. S. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. However, S. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats. In an in vivo assay, human strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. Collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their natural host tropisms. The selective adherence of S. salvarius and S. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. Moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. Direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. Indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. This localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

AB  - Stable sodium hypochlorite solution shows excellent disinfectant properties, even in higher dilution. Parallel to clinical tests in vitro experiments were made to show the changes of morphology of bacteria pathogenic for the urinary tract by scanning microscope. Two hours after incubation of the bacteria with sodium hypochlorite solution containing 40 mg available chlorine/1 severe damages of the bacterial morphology up to complete destruction were evident in all cases. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacilli were more, gram-positive cocci were less damaged.

TI  - Importance of streptococci as pathogens in the urinary tract.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis, while the most common streptococcal serotype causing urinary tract infection, is not the only one. Lancefield group A, B, C and G serotypes are capable of invading the urinary tract. This finding is not generally appreciated. The reason for this anomaly is seen in the failure of most investigators to utilise a definitive procedure to group streptococcal isolates from urine. Streptococci are responsible for 8.5 percent of urinary tract infections in this hospital.
TI  - [Studies on the growth requirements of enterococci (author's transl)].
AB  - The growth requirements of biochemically defined strains of the enterococcus species Streptococcus faecium, S. faecalis, S. faecalis var. zymogenes and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens were compared. Arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine, methionine and valine were essential and isoleucine, tryptophan, adenine and uracil were stimulatory to growth for all testes strains. Variation in the specific requirements occur for alanine, glycine, and serine representing strains differences. Threonine was essential for S. faecium strains but had no effect on the growth of strains of other species of enterococci.

AB  - A series of 19 quinazoline analogs of pteroic and isopteroic acid was prepared with particular emphasis being placed upon carboxylic acid esters. Each compound was evaluated as an inhibitor of the dihydrofolate reductases from rat liver as well as from Streptococcus faecium. Several of the more potent inhibitors were found to be inactive against L1210 leukemia in mice at low dose levels and were lethal to mice at 100 mg/kg. Six compounds were also evaluated for antimalarial activity against Plasmodium berghei in mice. Three of these were found to be curative at higher levels, while the remaining compounds were found to be toxic.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of human peritoneal fluid.
AB  - Cell free peritoneal fluids from 23 normal women had antimicrobial activity which was directed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against yeasts. The activity was bacteriostatic or bactericidal and seemed to be due to the presence of a variety of factors which varied in their heat stability and dependence on complement. Lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not responsible for all the antimicrobial activity.

Arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, tryptophane and valine were found to be essential, with alanine, glycine, lysine and serine as stimulatory and aspartic acid, cystine, phenylalanine, proline and tyrosine as non-essential for both growth and lipase synthesis.
TI  - The faecal flora in ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Differential counts of the faecal flora of patients with ulcerative colitis showed a dysbiotic flora with a 100-fold increase of group-D streptococci and a reduction of bifidobacteria in comparison with the stable eubiotic flora of healthy subjects. The increase in number in group-D streptococci was accompanied by an increase in variety. About four different varieties of enterococci were found in faeces from patients compared with one or two in samples from healthy subjects. The strains isolated from patients were more active in mucin breakdown, and only strains from patients were able to break down hyaluronic acid. Lactic acid could be formed from these substrates. The increased secretion of mucin in colitis and the presence of unprotected hyaluronic acid in ulcers seem to select these organisms which are probably the cause of the high lactic-acid content of the faeces in such patients.

TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
TI  - Transmissible toxin (hemolysin) plasmid in Streptococcus faecalis and its mobilization of a noninfectious drug resistance plasmid.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strain DS-5 has been shown previously to contain three plasmids, pAMalpha1, pAMbeta1, and pAMgamma1. Mixed incubation of DS-5 with strain JH2-2, a plasmid-free S. faecalis recipient, results in the transfer of pAMalpha1 (which determines resistance to tetracycline) and/or pAMgamma1. Analyses of recipients carrying various combinations of these plasmids have revealed the pAMgamma1 codes for toxin (hemolysin) production and two bacteriocin activities. JH2-2 strains carrying both pAMalpha1 and pAMgamma1, or pAMgamma1 only, can donate their plasmids to other recipients, whereas strains carrying only pAMalpha1 cannot serve as donors. This indicates that pAMgamma1 actually mobilizes the otherwise nontransferable pAMalpha1.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl analongs of some nitrofurans.
AB  - The sulfoxides 5-methylsulfinyl-2-furaldehyde semicarbazone (2) and 1-[(5-methylsulfinyl-2-fufurylidene)amino]hydantoin (3) as well as the sulfones 1-[(5-methylsulfonyl-2-furfurylidene)animo]hydantoin (1) and 1-(5-methylsulfonly-2-furyl)-2-(6-amino-3-p-ridazyl)ethylene hydrochloride (4) have been prepared and tested for antibacterial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The compounds are much less active than the corresponding 5-nitrofuran derivatives, possibly because their reduction potentials are too negative for them to interfere with reductive enzyme systems within the bacteria.

TI  - Morphology and viability of large bodies of streptococcal L-forms.
AB  - A procedure is described for the massive formation and isolation of large bodies  of group A and D streptococcal L-forms. Up to 90% individual bodies of 20 to 100 mum in diameter can be produced in pour plates of nutrient gelatin and subsequently harvested by simple micromanipulation. The growth of these giant bodies was followed by light microscopy and their ultrastructure and internal architecture was examined by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Large bodies had a honeycomb structure of vacuoles. Numerous small units could be observed inside, protruding into, and between vacuoles. Intact large bodies (30 to 60 mum), when placed in small amounts of broth and incubated at 35 C, initiated turbid cultures, but when set on agar, they ruptured, releasing internal granules and producing typical L-form colonies. The number of internal colony-forming units (CFU) was correlated with the size of large bodies. Up to 200 CFU were detected in bodies of 40 to 60 mum in diameter, whereas corpuscles of 20 to 30 mum averaged only three CFU. The inefficiency of replication was apparent with the determination by light and electron microscopy that at least 100 times as many granules and elementary corpuscles as CFU were produced inside large bodies.
TI  - Phage typing scheme for group D streptococci isolated from human urogenital tract.
AB  - Streptococci of Lancefield group D were isolated from 52.2% of pharyngeal, 55.5%  of urethral, 56.6% of endocervical, and 75.4% of ano-rectal specimens. Seventeen phages isolated from sewage and urogenital specimens were selected for phage typing. Four of these lysed only the strains of Streptococcus faecalis and its variety liquefaciens. Another six phages lysed only the strains of Streptococcus faecium and its variety durans. With the help of seven bacteriophages, 346 of 384 (90.1%) strains of S. faecalis and its variety liquefaciens could be classified into 27 types. Similarly, with the help of 10 other bacteriophages, 97 of 117 (82.9%) strains of S. faecium and its variety durans could be grouped into 22 types. In 72 of 87 (82.7%) cases, similar phage types were obtained at different culture sites of the same individual.
TI  - Streptococcal infections--updated.
AB  - Streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. Infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. In newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (Table 1). In normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. Although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. Erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. Infections with group D streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group B streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. Streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see Table 1). Thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.
TI  - Synthesis of peptidoglycan in the form of soluble glycan chains by growing protoplasts (autoplasts) of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Protoplasts (autoplasts) of Streptococcus faecalis were produced by the action of native autolytic N-acetylmuramidase in the absence of added peptidoglycan hydrolases and were grown in osmotically stabilized medium containing L-[3H]lysine and D-[14C]alanine. To reduce the level of muralytic hydrolysis of glycan chains during growth, heat-inactivated cell walls were added to the medium to bind autolytic enzyme, and tetracycline (1 mug/ml) was added to inhibit further enzyme synthesis. Under these conditions, protoplasts synthesized newly labeled peptidoglycan in the form of soluble, infrequently peptide cross-linked glycan chains which were released into the supernatant medium. These relatively large glycan chains were not transferred to exogenously added cell walls.
TI  - Characterization of the presumed peptide cross-links in the soluble peptidoglycan fragments synthesized by protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were produced with the aid of lysozyme, and the ability of these bodies to synthesize soluble, peptide cross-linked peptidoglycan (PG) fragments was examined. Lysozyme digests of PG isolated using gel filtration from the supernatant medium of protoplasts grown in the presence of [14C]acetate and L-[3H]lysine contained small amounts of PG having KD expected for peptide cross-linked dimers and trimers. Addition of benzyl penicillin (300 mug/ml) to growing protoplast cultures did not affect the net amount of PG fragments synthesized but resulted in inhibition of synthesis of dimer and trimer fractions by 27 and 59%, respectively. Failure of penicillin to completely inhibit the accumulation of the dimer fraction was attributed to the presence of atypical forms of dimer. In fact, the supernatant medium of penicillin-treated cultures did not contain detectable amounts of typical peptide cross-linked dimer. The degree of peptide cross-linkage of protoplast PG was at most only 13% of that found in walls isolated from intact streptococci. The relative amounts of monomers, dimers, and trimers synthesized during early and late stages of protoplast growth was approximately the same. Protoplasts synthesized soluble PG fragments in amounts which were of the same order of magnitude as that expected for insoluble PG produced by an equivalent amount of intact streptococci.
TI  - Evidence for the synthesis of soluble peptidoglycan fragments by protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Growing protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis 9790 were found to synthesize and excrete soluble peptidoglycan fragments. The presence of soluble peptidoglycan derivatives in culture supernatants was determined by (i) incorporation of three different radioactively labeled precursors (L-lysine, D-alanine, and acetate) into products which, after hen egg-white lysozyme hydrolysis, had the same KD values on gel filtration as muramidase hydrolysis products of isolated walls; (ii) inhibition of net synthesis of these products by cycloserine and vancomycin; and (iii) identification of disaccharide-peptide monomer using the beta-elimination reaction, gel filtration, and high-voltage paper electrophoresis. Under the conditions of these experiments the presence of newly synthesized, acid-precipitable (macromolecular) peptidoglycan was not detected. The predominance of monomer (70 to 80%) in lysozyme digests of peptidoglycan synthesized by protoplasts was in sharp contrast to digest of walls from intact streptococci which contain mostly peptide cross-linked products. Biosynthesis and release of relatively uncross-linked, soluble peptidoglycan fragments by protoplasts was related to the absence of suitable, preexisting acceptor wall.
TI  - [Microbiological study of gentamiycin].
AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.
TI  - Studies of the formation of peptide cross-links in the cell wall peptidoglycan of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A method was developed to label specifically the glycan chains of the cell wall peptidoglycan of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 with [14C]acetate. The formation of peptide cross-links (a) during exponential growth, (b) after valine starvation and wall thickening, and (c) during regrowth after 2 hours of valine starvation, was studied using continuous, pulse and pulse-chase labeling of the peptidoglycan with both [14C]acetate and [3H]lysine. After labeling, walls were isolated, digested with the muramidase of Chalaropsis B, and the "free" peptidoglycan fragments (75 to 90% of the total peptidoglycan) were then fractionated on columns of Sephadex G-50, G-50, and G-25 in series into disaccharide-peptide monomer and peptide cross-linked bisdisaccharide-peptide dimer, trisdisaccharide-peptide trimer, and higher oligomer fractions. Peptidoglycan made during valine starvation and wall thickening was found to be slightly more cross-linked than peptidoglycan made during exponential growth. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments indicated that peptide cross-linking continued for an unexpectedly long time after incorporation of precursors into insoluble peptidoglycan.
TI  - Long-distance bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness of parachlorophenol and Formalin on Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans.
AB  - The "long-distance" bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness of several concentrations of parachlorophenol, 25% Formalin, and 2% glutaraldehyde, all in 80% alcohol solution, has been tested in vitro on Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. A concentration of at least 10% parachlorophenol in 80% alcoholic solution has the same long-distance bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness as 25% Formalin in 80% alcoholic solution.
TI  - Survival of Salmonella and other indicator microorganisms.
AB  - Survival times for enteric bacteria and fecal streptococci were investigated using filter-sterilized water from a northern Illinois river and temperatures of 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees C. Survival of Salmonella typhimurium was essentially the same as Escherichia coli over normal seasonal temperatures. Fecal streptococci generally exhibited classic survival patterns.
TI  - Relationship between various bacterial populations and coprostanol and cholesterol.
AB  - A year-long study was conducted at three different locations in Canada to evaluate the relationship between fecal sterols and bacterial populations. A statistical model was constructed to study the following: (i) seasonal variations in the sterols and bacterial parameters; (ii) the differences between morning and afternoon samples; (iii) the relationship between the two sterols (coprostanol and cholesterol) as well as their relationship to the bacterial parameters; and (iv) the geographical differences between the three sampling sites. Application of the model to the data indicated that (i) the relationship in receiving waters between coprostanol and cholesterol was found to be highly significant; (ii) at two sampling sites the relationship between fecal sterols and fecal coliforms was positively significant at the 5% level; (iii) at one sampling site there was a positive relationship between fecal sterols and the fecal coliform - fecal streptococcus ratio; and (iv) in a.m. vs. p.m. samples significant differences were noted in coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococcus densities while no significant differences were found in heterotroph densities and coprostanol and cholesterol levels. Raw and treated sewage from four sewage-treatment plants were also studied to provide baseline control data. Data support the conclusion that while no consistent relationship exists between bacterial parameters and fecal sterols, fecal sterols could be considered as unequivocal indicators of the presence of fecal material in water.
TI  - Methotrexate analogs. 6. Replacement of glutamic acid by various amino acid esters and amines.
AB  - A series of methotrexate (MTX) analogs was prepared in which the glutamic acid moiety is replaced by various amino acid esters and amines. The synthetic method consisted of the reaction of 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic acid with various reagents to form intermediate mixed anhydrides, which then reacted with amino acid esters or amines to give the MTX analogs. These compounds were tested for antibacterial activity against Streptococcus faecium and for antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in mice. Several compounds showed significant antibacterial activity; the MTX homocysteinethiolactone and MTX aspartate analogs showed marginal in vivo antitumor activity.
TI  - Purification and properties of an NADP-specific 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A procedure is described for the purification of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-phospho-D-gluconate:NADP oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) EC 1.1.1.44) from cell extracts of Streptococcus gaecalis. A 180-fold purification was achieved with an over-all yield of about 12% and an average specific activity of 14. The enzyme was homogeneous as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and sedimentation equilibrium, studies. Its weight average molecular weight, as measured by sedimentation equilibrium, was 108,000 +/- 3,600. Other methods employed for molecular weight determinations gave values that ranged between 106,000 and 115,000. An analysis of the enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed it to be a dimer composed of subunits having equal molecular weight. The amino acid composition of the streptococcal enzyme is reported. The apparent Km values for NADP and 6-phosphogluconate were calculated from kinetic data and found to be 0.015 mM and 0.024 mM, respectively. Kinetic studies also indicated that the binding of one substrate did not affect the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate.
TI  - Effect of valinomycin on ion transport in bacterial cells and on bacterial growth.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of valinomycin relative to the K+ and Na+ contents of the medium has been investigated in several species of bacteria, particularly in Streptococcus faecalis, which effects energy-linked transport exclusively via degradation of glycolytic ATP, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, effecting active ion transport by respiration and Staphylococcus aureus, the energy-dependent ion transport of which is due to both glycolytic ATP degradation and respiration. It was demonstrated that valinomycin does not act on K+ transport in the glycolysing cells in the same manner as it does on respiring cells under similar conditions. Addition of valinomycin to respiring cells leads to an increase in K+ influx against the concentrational gradient in both growing and resting cells. In contrast to this, antibiotic-treated glycolysing cells experience passive K+ outflow down the concentrational gradient. It was thus concluded that the electrical potential cannot be the driving force for the energy-linked K+ transport in glycolysing cells.
TI  - Studies on the establishment of multi-drug-resistant strain BIO-4R of Streptococcus faecalis in the intestinal tract of germ-free mice. Bacterial interaction and effect of antibiotics.
AB  - Germ-free ICR mice were mono- or dicontaminated with a multi-drug-resistant strain BIO-4R of Streptococcus faecalis (BIO-4R) and Escherichia coli 026 : K60 (E. coli) and administered aminobenzyl penicillin (ABPC). BIO-4R was established in the intestinal tract at a level of 10(8) viable cells per gram of stool on the fourth day following oral inoculation and the BIO-4R population was stably maintained thereafter. The drug resistance of BIO-4R remained unchanged in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotes throughout the experiment. Highly resistant cells of E. coli were isolated from the feces of some dicontaminated mice after ABPC administration. However, it seems that the high resistance of these E. coli is not due to the transfer of resistance of BIO-4R to E. coli. All animals given a large amount of BIO-4R (10(8) cells) per os survived throughout the study period of two weeks without symptoms.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - Streptococcal infection in young pigs. IV. An outbreak of streptococcal meningitis in weaned pigs.
AB  - Twenty-eight pigs died in an outbreak of streptococcal meningitis in an East Anglian herd. Most were 10-14 weeks old. The outbreak lasted from January to April and was finally controlled by antibiotic therapy. A similar number of losses had occurred in the previous year though no diagnosis had then been made. The causal agent appeared to be a haemolytic streptococcus belonging to group D and provisionally designated Streptococcus suis type 2. It is probably identical with de Moor's group R streptococcus which causes a similar disease in the Netherlands. It is serologically distinct from Streptococcus suis type 1 which causes meningitis in piglets. Type 2 infection in pigs appears to be widespread in England and Wales and to occur in animals up to the age of at least 14 weeks. A comparison is drawn between Str. suis meningitis in pigs and group B streptococcal meningitis in human infants.
TI  - Synthesis and excretion of glycerol teichoic acid during growth of two streptococcal species.
AB  - Examination of both supernatant culture medium and cell pellets after exponential- and stationary-phase growth of Streptococcus mutans strain FA-1 and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 (S. faecium) showed the presence of [-3H]glycerol-labeled material that possessed several of the properties of glycerol teichoic acid. In the supernatant medium of S. mutans FA-1, an apparently large-molecular-size material, which eluted from agarose columns with the Kd value expected of a lipoteichoic acid, was observed. Large amounts of this material were present in supernatants during the stationary phase. In contrast, with S. faecalis only an apparently lower-molecular-weight form, with a Kd consistent with deacylated glycerol teichoic acid, was found in the growth medium. Both organisms had high-molecular-weight lipoteichoic acid in the cells along with the deacylated glycerol teichoic acid. The presence of relatively large amounts of glycerol teichoic acids in the medium was considered to be a result of excretion of these compounds rather than a result of cellular lysis.
TI  - Experimental production of elevated serum folate in dogs with intestinal blind loops. II. Nature of bacterially produced folate coenzymes in blind loop fluid.
AB  - Jejunal and ileal blind loops were constructed in separate groups of dogs and the folate coenzymes present in these loops were investigated. Although only those dogs with high blind loops had appreciably elevated folate levels active for Lactobacillus casei but not Streptococcus faecalis, every blind loop appeared to contain four folate compounds--5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, tetrahydrofolic acid and a compound tentatively identified as 5-formyltetrahydrofolic triglutamate. Why increased levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate alone are present in the serum of dogs with a high blind loop is discussed.
TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. I.  The role of vaginal pH.
AB  - The pH of the vaginal introitus was compared to quantitative cultures of the introital mucosa (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus faecalis) in 800 samples. Introital carriage of more than 100 bacteria per ml. was significantly greater at pH of more than 4.4 (p less than 0.005) when compared to mucosal pH of less than or equal to 4.4.
TI  - Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.
TI  - Survival of human enteric and other sewage microorganisms under simulated deep-sea conditions.
AB  - The survival of pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus under simulated deep-sea conditions of low temperature (4 C), seawater, and hydrostatic pressures ranging from 1 to 1,000 atm was determined over a period exceeding 300 h. The viability of E. coli and total aerobic bacteria in seawater-diluted raw sewage subjected to these deep-sea conditions was also measured. There was a greater survival of both E. coli and S. faecalis at 250 and 500 atm than at 1 atm at 4 C. S. faecalis was quite insensitive to 1,000 atm, whereas with E. coli there was a 10-fold die-off per 50-h exposure to 1,000 atm. In contrast, V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens were quite sensitive to pressures exceeding 250 atm, and with both of these species there was a total loss of viability of approximately 10(8) cells per ml within 100 h at 1,000 arm and within 200 h at 500 atm. The viability of the naturally occurring fecal coliforms in sewage exposed to moderate pressures at 4 C was found to be similar to the survival patterns demonstrated with pure cultures of E. coli. The total numbers of aerobic bacteria in these sewage samples, however, stabilized at 500 and 1,000 atm after 100 h, and at 1 and 250 atm there was significant growth of sewage-associated bacteria, which apparently utilized the organic compounds in the seawater-diluted sewage samples. A preliminary classification of some of these bacteria indicated that approximately 90% (160 isolates) of the organisms that survived over a 400-h exposure to 500 and 1,000 atm were Arthrobacter/Corynebacterium species, and the representative organisms capable of growing at 1 and 250 atm in seawater at 4 C were gram-positive cellulose digesters and an unidentified gram-negative coccus. The significance of these results with respect to the contamination of the deep ocean with human pathogens and the possibility of sewage-associated microorganisms growing and competing with indigenous marine microbial flora in situ is discussed.
TI  - Relationship of bacterial infection in urine and calculi to canine urolithiasis.
AB  - In 26 dogs treated surgically for urolithiasis, bacteriological examination of the urine and the interior of calculi showed that infection was present in both materials in 14 cases. Infection with phosphate calculi, present in 13 of these 14 dogs, was associated with a variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. In a follow-up examination of 16 dogs, organisms different from the original isolates were recovered from some cases. The significance of the persistence of viable bacteria within canine bladder calculi is discussed.

TI  - Effect of hyperbaric helium on vitamin uptake and utilization by micro-organisms.
AB  - Growth responses under hyperbaric helium of various procaryotic micro-organisms to graded levels of six water-soluble vitamins were measured. Vitamins included: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, and folic acid (folacin). Growth response of each organism under hyperbaric helium was compared with that under 80% He-20% O2 and other He-O2 gas mixtures at atmospheric pressure, and with response in air at atmospheric pressure. For five of the six vitamins, no differences in response were observed. Growth response of Streptococcus faecalis to growth-limiting concentrations of folic acid was depressed during cultivation under He-O2 at 69 ATA. It is concluded that growth response of the organism is repressed by hyperbaric helium as a result of interference with uptake or utilization of the vitamin.
TI  - Protein quality of feeding-stuffs. 7. Collaborative studies on the microbiological assay of available amino acids.
AB  - 1. Twenty-two samples of high-protein feeding-stuffs, sixteen of them fish meals, were used in a collaborative study of the precision and the limits of discrimination of the Streptococcus zymogenes assay procedure, as applied to the estimation of available methionine, tryptophan and isoleucine contents. 2. All the participating laboratories ranked the test samples in much the same sequence with respect to content for all three amino acids. There were apparently systematic differences between laboratories which impaired the precision of some of the estimates, and these were greatly reduced by including common reference sample in the tests as an auxilliary standard. 3. Values for available methionine content for eleven test samples were highly correlated (r 0.86) and quantitatively similar to those obtained for chick growth assays, but those for available tryptophan content were markedly lower and were probably in error.

TI  - Membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  - A membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. The procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. The procedure (mE) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. Essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium. Neither S. bovis, S. equinus, S. mitis, nor S. salivarius grew on the medium. The selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 C. About 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact, identified as enterococci. Plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. Verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the mE procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the KF method by one order of magnitude.
TI  - Phosphatidylkojibiosyl Diglyceride: metabolism and function as an anchor in bacterial cell membrane.
AB  - The recently discovered phosphoglycolipid, phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride (PKD), was first observed as a biosynthetic by-product of glycosyl diglyceride metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790. Its structure is 1, 2-diacyl-3-O-alpha-Dglucopyranosyl-6'-O-phosphoryl- [1'', 2''-diacyl-3''-O-sn-glycerol]-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol. The biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride occurs by a novel transphosphatidylation reaction in which a phosphatidyl glycerol to the primary alcohol function at the 6 position of the internal glucose of kojibiosyl diglyceride. The reaction is catalyzed by a membrane-derived enzyme. Phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride is bound covalently through a phosphodiester bond to the polyglycerol phosphate moiety of membrane lipoteichoic acid from S. faecalis. Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride has four nonpolar long chain fatty acyl groups and appears to have the necessary physico-chemical properties to anchor the long hydrophilic glycerol phosphate polymer of lipoteichoic acid to the hydrophobic enviroment of the membrane of S. faecalis and probably other gram-positive bacteria as well.
TI  - The inhibition of bacterial growth by ochratoxin A.
AB  - A series of bacterial species was examined for their sensitivity to ochratoxin A. Only grampositive bacteria could be inhibited, generally at a pH lower than 7.0. Bacillus subtilis did not show any reduction of growth rates in presence of ochratoxin A, but had a prolonged lag phase. With Staphylococcus pyogenes var. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, a prolonged lag phase and a reduction of the growth rate was observed. Most sensitive was Streptococcus faecalis in the exponential-growth phase. The inhibition could be diminished by changing the pH to neutral, or by addition of yeast extract, tetrahydrofolate, or MgSO4. With MgSO4 a complete abolition of the inhibitory effect was achieved, but not with CaCl2. During growth inhibition, protein and RNA synthesis were reduced simultaneously, but not DNA synthesis. Even with the very high concentration of 1 mg/ml, no lethal effect was observed.

TI  - Interaction of bacterial cell wall polymers and rat macrophages.
AB  - Processing of group A and group D streptococcal cell wall was measured after phagocytosis by normal rat peritoneal cells in tissue culture. Group A cell wall was practically non-biodegradable in contrast to group D, which was over 80% degraded by 4-8 days in culture. There was no difference in elimination or degradation of mucopeptide or polysaccharide of group A cell walls. Neither antiserum or sensitized lymphocytes affected persistence. Macrophages from Fisher rats (susceptible to group A cell wall-induced polyarthritis) became cytotoxic for target L-cells 6-7 days after ingestion of group A cell walls. Phagocytosis of group D cell walls induced less cytotoxicity. Macrophages from Buffalo rats (resistant to polyarthritis) were less cytotoxic after phagocytosis of group A cell walls than Fisher macrophages. Soluble cytotoxins could not be detected in macrophage culture media.
TI  - An electron microscopic study of the location of teichoic acid and its contribution to staining reactions in walls of Streptococcus faecalis 8191.
AB  - The location of the glucosylated teichoic acid in whole cells and isolated walls  of Streptococcus faecalis 8191 has been investigated using ruthenium red, gold-labelled concanavalin A and concanavalin A-peroxidase-diaminobenzidine. Dense laminae were revealed in sections of osmium-fixed walls stained with ruthenium red which corresponded to similar regions stained by uranyl and lead. Such regions were not seen after teichoic acid had been extracted, suggesting that the uptake of stain was by teichoic acid. However, these regions were not labelled on exposure to gold concanavalin A or concanavalin A-peroxidase-diaminobenzidine; these stains indicated that teichoic acid was situated between the dense laminae, although the distribution of stain could have been due to the inability of the concanavalin A stains to penetrate deeply. Chemical binding studies showed that the teichoic acid was the major uranyl binding component in isolated walls, from which it might be inferred that teichoic acid was located in the densely staining regions. However, since osmification significantly increased the binding of uranyl (and lead stains) to non-teichoic acid material, such an inference was not necessarily valid. It is concluded that the presence of teichoic acid can be demonstrated in certain regions of the wall by concanavalin A, but its presence in densely staining regions has not been established. These experiments therefore suggest that teichoic acid may not be intimately associated with the mechanisms that generate contrast patterns in stained sections of cell walls of Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - The structure of dihydrofolate reductase. Identification of methionine residues carboxymethylated by iodoacetate with loss of catalytic activity.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase from the amethopterin-resistant mutant (strain A) of Streptococcus faecium var. Durans was reacted with iodo[14C]acetate according to three procedures; (a) in the absence of an inhibitor, (b) in the presence of aminopterin, and (c) in absence of inhibitor, but after treatment with unlabeled iodoacetate in presence of aminopterin. The first and last procedures resulted in the loss of approximately 90% of the catalytic activity, whereas in the presence of aminopterin essentially no activity was lost. Peptides were produced from all three labeled proteins by tryptic digestion after citraconylation of the lysine residues. From the amino acid compositions and partial amino acid sequences of these peptides the position of all modified methionines in the sequence was determined. The extent of labeling at each methionine, in enzyme labeled in the different procedures, indicated that methionines 28 and 50 may be at the binding site for inhibitors and that residue 50 is less accessible to iodoacetate than is residue 28. It is likely that carboxymethylation of residue 28 is responsible for the loss of enzyme activity.
TI  - Alpha-methyl-L-glutamic acid uptake by high affinity dicarboxylic amino acid transport system in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The transport of alpha-methyl-L-glutamic acid was studied in Streptococcus faecalis. Energey-dependent uptake against substantial concentration gradients was observed. Kinetic experiments indicated that, in contrast to L-glutamic acid, only a single catalytic component (high affinity) and a diffusion controlled process participated in alpha-methyl-L-glutamic acid uptake. At concentrations up to 10 mM, alpha-methyl-glutamate transport was almost completely abolished in a mutant strain lacking a high affinity dicarboxylic amino acid transport system. In competition experiments, alpha-methylglutamic acid antagonized glutamate uptake via the high affinity system, and only slightly via the low affinity system. Column chromatography of cell extracts showed that very little (approx. 5%) of the accumulated amino acid was converted to metabolites during short term incubations. These studies indicate that, at concentrations up to 3-5 mM, alpha-methyl-L-glutamic acid can be used as a specific, relatively metabolically inert substrate of the high affinity dicarboxylic amino acid transport system in S. faecalis.
TI  - Plasmid-determined resistance to erythromycin: comparison of strains of streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes with regard to plasmid hmology and resistance inducibility.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strains DS-5 and Streptococcus pyogenes strain AC-1 both have a 17 million dalton plasmid that determines resistance to erythromycin, lincomycin, and vernamycin B(alpha). The results of deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization experiments indicate that the two plasmids are about 95% homologous. It was also shown that erythromycin resistance is inducible in AC-1 and constitutive in DS-5.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - Cellular localization of lipoteichoic acid in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The release of lipoteichoic acid and mesosomal vesicles to the supernatant buffer during the formation of spherical, osmotically fragile bodies was studied using Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790. Autolytic N-acetylmuramidase action was permitted to take place in exponential-phase cells incubated in a buffer which provides an exceptional degree of osmotic stabilization. Both lipoteichoic acid and mesosomal vesicles were relatively rapidly released to the supernatant buffer. Most of the cellular content of lipoteichoic acid (and mesosomal vesicles) was found in the supernatant buffer at incubation times when the cells still retained over 75% of their cell wall. [14-C]- or [3-H]glycerol was used as a label for both cellular lipoteichoic acids and lipid-glycerol. Glycerol in lipoteichoic acid was quantitated after phenol-water and chloroform-methanol treatments and identified by products of acid hydrolysis and its ability to be precipitated by (i) antibodies specific for the polyglycerol-phosphate backbone, (ii) antibodies to the streptococcal group D antigen, and (iii) concanavalin A. Evidence was obtained that lipoteichoic acid was not associated with isolated mesosomal vesicles. Centrifugation of supernates at 200,000 X g sedimented membranous (mesosomal) vesicles and nearly all of the lipid-glycerol present, whereas essentially all of the lipoteichoic acid remained in the supernatant. The sedimented mesosomal vesicles differed from protoplast membrane in their higher lipid-phosphorus to protein ratio and in the absence of detectable levels of two enzymatic activities found in protoplast membranes, adenosine triphosphatase and polynucleotide phosphorylase. Both types of membranes were found to contain DD-carboxypeptidase and LD-transpeptidase activities at nearly the same specific activities. No evidence was obtained for the association of autolytic N-acetylmuramidase activity with either type of membrane preparation.
TI  - Subclinical mastitis in suckler cows.
AB  - In a two-year study of the incidence of subclinical mastitis in two beef suckler  herds over 2400 quarter milk samples from 180 cows were examined. Somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts were carried out and infecting organisms were isolated on sheep blood agar. Results of these tests indicated that: (a) in spite of extremely dirty udders, fewer contaminants were found in the suckler cow milk samples than in a group of over 1700 samples from typical dairy herds; (b) 18 per cent of all quarter milk samples were infected; (c) 67 per cent of all infections were due to staphylococci and 20 per cent to streptococci; (d) 56 per cent of staphylococcal infections were associated with cell counts less than 500,000 per ml compared with 39 per cent of other infections; (e) 70 per cent of samples had somatic cell counts less than 500,000 per ml. (f) 20 per cent of samples had somatic cell counts over 1 million per ml; (g) only 36 per cent of samples with cell counts over 1 million per ml were associated with udder infections; (h) high cell counts and udder infections were more frequent in early than in mid-lactation. Due to a shortage of animals in the late lactation little evidence was available to support the contention that cell counts rise and the numbers of infected quarters increase towards the end of lactation.
TI  - Phagocytosis in patients and carriers of chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  - The phagocytic capacity of leucocytes from four patients and two carriers of chronic granulomatous disease (C.G.D.) was compared to that of normal leucocytes. Leucocytes from C.G.D. patients phagocytised more Staphylococcus aureus than did normal leucocytes after 5, 10, and 20 minutes of incubation. Phagocytosis by leucocytes from two carriers of C.G.D. was intermediate between that in the patients and in controls. In contrast, phagocytosis of Streptococcus faecalis, an organism readily killed by C.G.D. leucocytes, was similar for control and C.G.D. leucocytes. Enhanced phagocytosis may represent an attempt by leucocytes to compensate for a bactericidal abnormality. In addition, these observations may partly explain why carriers of C.G.D. are not more susceptible to infection despite abnormal leucocyte function. Detection of carriers using the described assay of phagocytosis appears relatively simple compared to previously described methods.
TI  - [Clinical study with Spectacillin on patients with infections of the urogenital system (author's transl)].
AB  - Report is given of clinical experiences gained with the new developed semi-syntheticpenicillin "Spectacillin" on 75 patients suffering from an urological disease. The drug has been applied for therapy of acute and chronic forms of inflammations of the bladder and the urethra, additionally the prostatitis, the epididymitis, but first of all the pyelonephritis (caused bacterially). Within the germ spectrum of these diseases, germs of the coli-type, streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus, pseudomonas and aerobacter were found. Patients with acute/subacute diseases have been treated 8 to 9 days (3-4 grams per day) on an average; in case of chronic diseases, the patients received initially 1 gram a day and thereupon during 3 to 4 weeks 3 to 4 grams per day. The well-succeeded results have been documentated by means of the clinical course, the germ-elimination and the laboratory findings. The exanthematous quote may be demonstrated as remarkably low, considering the good universal compatibility of the substance. For this reason "Spectacillin" not finally is suitable for treatment of acute and chronic infections of the urogenital systems.
TI  - Plasmid-determined tetracycline resistance in Streptococcus faecalis: evidence for gene amplification during growth in presence of tetracycline.
AB  - The tetracycline (TG)-resistant Streptococcus faecalis strain DS-5Cl harbors two  plasmids designated alpha and gamma with molecular masses of approximately 6 and 35 million daltons, respectively. TC-sensitive variants were derived by storing cells at 45 degrees for 2-3 weeks. Analysis of covalently closed circular DNA from five such variants (derived independently) revealed that in each variant the alpha-plasmid, which normally sediments at 28 S (supercoiled) in a sucrose density gradient, was replaced by a 22S substance. Growth of DS-5Cl in the presence of 150 mug/ml of TC (minimum inhibitory concentration is 250 mug/ml in liquid broth) for a prolonged period of time (50-60 generations) resulted in the disappearance of 28S DNA and the appearance of a heterogeneous covalently-closed circular DNA sedimenting at about 40-48 S. This phenomenon was accompanied by an increase in the level of bacterial TC-resistance, whereby tells were subsequently grown in the absence of TC for 70-80 generations, the heterogeneous DNA disappeared and a typical 28S alpha-plasmid reappeared. The cells also became less resistant to TC, i.e., the minimum inhibitory concentration returned to 250 mug/ml. These data suggest that bacterial growth in the presence of TC results in a reversible gene amplification with respect to a TC-resistant determinant residing on the alpha-plasmid.
TI  - Synthesis of N-10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid and related compounds.
AB  - Compound 21 (N10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid) and related compounds were prepared as  potential inhibitors of the cofactor forms of tetrahydrofolate. The preparation of 2-acetylamino-4-(benzylthio)-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (4) provided an intermediate that was allowed to react with methyl p-[(3-aminoacetonyl)methylamino]benzoate oxime (16). The oxime function of the resulting 6-substituted aminopyrimidine 6 was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding acetonylaminopyrimidine 7, which on reductive cyclization gave methyl p-[[[2-amino-4-(benzylthio)-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl]methyl]methylamino]benzoate (9). This dihydropteridine was oxidized with potassium permanganate, and the product was treated successively with sodium hydrosulfide to replace the benzylthio group and with aqueous sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester function to give p-[[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-thioxo-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoic acid (N10-methyl-4-thiopteroic acid, 12). Another route to 12 involved the interaction of 2,5-diamino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (15) with 16 to give methyl p-[[(2-amino-4-chloro-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoate (13). Displacement of the chloro group of 13 with sodium hydrosulfide followed by the simultaneous air oxidation of the dihydropteridine ring and saponification of the ester group gave 12. After protection of the 2-amino and 4-thioxo moieties of 12, the resulting intermediate benzoic acid was coupled with diethyl L-glutamate. The product of this reaction was deblocked to give 21. Methylation of 21 gave the corresponding 4-(methylthio) derivative 22, which on reaction with hydrazine gave the 4-hydrazino analog 23 of methotrexate. Reduction of 12 and 21 with sodium hydrosulfite gave the dihydropteridines 24 and 25, respectively. The title compound was an excellent inhibitor of the growth of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043. However, this and related compounds were ineffective inhibitors of dihydrofolic reductase and showed no significant activity in either the KB cell culture screen or against L1210 leukemia cells in mice.
TI  - Studies of cephalothin: aminoglycoside synergism against enterococci.
AB  - Combinations of cephalothin and aminoglycoside antibiotics are not currently used in the therapy of serious enterococcal infections, because clinical trials of these combinations have been unsuccessful. Studies of 28 enterococci isolated from patients with enterococcal bacteremia suggested three possible mechanisms for this in vivo antibiotic failure: (i) a relatively high level of resistance to cephalothin among all enterococci and especially those characterized as Streptococcus faecium, (ii) a significant incidence of high-level resistance to the aminoglycosides among certain strains of enterococci, and (iii) a failure of synergism to occur when cephalothin concentrations fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the enterococcus, as occurs during the in vivo metabolism and excretion of this antibiotic when given in standard doses for endocarditis.
TI  - Effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  - Sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin S by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the N-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. In concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Eschierichia coli but not of Streptococcus faecalis. Viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by cyanate; however, production of [14-C] carbon dioxide from [1-14-C] glucose and the iodination of 125-I during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. Cyanate is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of H-2-O-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). Since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they are due to amino carbamylation.
TI  - Enzymatic adaptation by bacteria under pressure.
AB  - A study of enzymic adaptation under hydrostatic pressure by moderately barotolerant bacteria that can grow at pressure up to about 500 atm revealed that some adaptive processes are relatively insensitive to pressure, whereas others are sufficiently barosensitive to compromise survival capacity in situations requiring adaptation to new substrates under pressure. Examples of the former include adaptation of Escherichia coli to arabinose catabolism for growth and adaptation of Streptococcus faecalis to catabolism of lactose, ribose, or maltose. Examples of the latter include derepression of the lac operon in Escherichia coli and induction of penicillinase synthesis by Bacillus licheniformis. For both these barosensitive systems, pressure had little effect on enzyme levels in constitutive strains or in bacteria that had previously been induced at 1 atm. Moreover, it had no detectable effect on penicillinase secretion. However, pressures of 300 to 400 atm were found to reduce markedly rates and extents of enzyme synthesis by bacteria undergoing derepression or adaptation. This inhibitory effect of pressure was reflected in greater barosensitivity with extended lag and slower growth of initially unadapted Escherichia coli cells inoculated into minimal medium with lactose as sole source of carbon and fuel, and by major reductions in the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G for unadapted B. licheniformis cells inoculated into complex, antibiotic-containing media. Cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate did not reverse pressure inhibition of derepression of the lac operon, and catabolite repression was complete under pressure. However, derepression of the lac operon was more sensitive to pressure at low concentrations of inducer than at high concentrations. Apparent volume changes for derepression were 94 and 60 ml/mol at inducer concentrations of about 0.5 and 5 mM, respectively. Pressure was found not to be inhibitory for uptake of beta-galactosides; in fact, it was somewhat stimulatory. Therefore, results were interpreted in terms of inducer binding and subsequent conversion of an operator-inducer-repressor complex to inactive repressor and operator. Both reactions appeared to result in an increase in volume, the former more so than the latter. We found also that 200 atm was actually stimulatory for growth of Escherichia coli in minimal media, and the bacterium was in a sense barophilic.

TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
TI  - Structure-activity correlations among rifamycin B amides and hydrazides.
AB  - Structure-antibacterial activity correlation equations have been developed for aseries of 44 amides and 25 hydrazides of rifamycin B in five bacterial systems. The best amide equations show that activity is a parabolic function of log P. A wide variation in log Po was found for the various bacterial systems. The most important correlation parameter in the hydrazide equations is omicron*. The significance of this finding is somewhat obscured by the high degree of collinearity among the parameters evaluated (omicron*, E-s, log P). Two rifamycin B amides were prepared and evaluated as a result of this study. The correlation equations quantitatively predicted their activity in five of six tests.
TI  - Accumulation of arsenate, phosphate, and aspartate by Sreptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Uptake of arsenate and phosphate by Streptococcus faecalis 9790 is strictly dependent on concurrent energy metabolism and essentially unidirectional. targinine supports uptake only in presence of glycerol or related substances; glycerol is not directly involved in transport but depletes the cellular orthophosphate pool and thus relieves feedback inhibition of transport. Uptake of phosphate and arsenate is stimulated by K+ and by other permeant cations. The results suggest that electroneutrality is preserved by compensatory movement of either H+ or OH minus. Ionophores and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which prevent establishment of a proton motive force, block the accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside and of threonine but not that of arsenate or phosphate. We conclude that arsenate accumulation requires adenosine 5'-triphosphate but is not driven by the proton-motive force. However, conditions and reagents that lower the cytoplasmic pH do inhibit accumulation of arsenate and phosphate, suggesting that uptake depends on the capacity of the cells to maintain a neutral or alkaline cytoplasm. We therefore propose that phosphate accumulation is an electroneutral exchange for OH driven by adenosine 5'-triphosphate or by a metabolite thereof. Accumulation of aspartate and glutamate also requires adenosine 5'-triphosphate but not the proton-motive force and may involve a similar mechanism.
TI  - Transport and metabolism of folates by bacteria.
AB  - Transport of labeled folic acid (PteGlu), pteroylpolyglutamates (PteGlu3-5), 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-H4PteGlu), and methotrexate in late-log phase cells of Lactobacillus casei was active, and subject to inhibition by unlabeled pteroylmonoglutamates, pteroylpolyglutamates, and iodoacetate, but not glutamate or glutamate dipeptides. Pteroylpolyglutamates were transported without prior hydrolysis and shared a common uptake system with pteroylmonoglutamates. The affinity and maximum velocity of PteGlun uptake decreased with increasing glutamate chin length (Km:PteGlu1, 0.03 mum; PteGlu3, 0.32 mum; PteGlu4, 1.9 mum; PteGlu5, 3.7 mum) and comparisons with growth response curves suggested that polyglutamates were more effectively utilized by L. casei, once transported, than monoglutamate. No concentration of 5-methyl-H4PteGlu3-8 inside the cells was observed. The major folate metabolites found in L. casei preloaded with high levels of [3H]PteGlu (0.5 mum) were 10-formyl-H4PteGlu2 and 10-formyl-PteGlu. Both compounds were released, the monoglutamate more rapidly. Pteroyltriglutamate formation appeared to be a rate-limiting step in intracellular metabolism. No 10-formyl-Pte-Glu was found in iodoacetate-treated cells and efflux was inhibited. Cells preloaded with low levels of [3H]PteGlu (7 nm) metabolized the vitamin to polyglutamate forms, the major derivatives being H4PteGlun. First order exit rates of labeled folate from preloaded L. casei indicated an inhibition of PteGlu uptake with time. Exit rates dropped from 0.05 min-1 to greater than 0.002 min-1 as intracellular folate was metabolized from monoglutamate to polyglutamate derivatives (n larger than or equal to 3). In the latter case, materials lost by efflux were breakdown products and no folate of glutamate chain length greater than two was released. Pediococcus cerevisiae actively transported 5-methyl-H4PteGlu but did not take up to 5-methyl-H4PTeGlu3-8. No active accumulation of 5-methyl-H4PteGlu was observed in Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Solubilization of bacterial membrane proteins using alkyl glucosides and dioctanoyl phosphatidylcholine.
AB  - The non-ionic detergent octyl glucoside solubilizes a substantial amount of Streptococcus faecalis membrane protein without loss of the monitored enzyme activities. A secondary detergent, dioctanoyl phophatidycholine, appears to increase the yield of solubilized material. In addition, the effect of ionic strength indicates that it may be possible to selectively extract groups of membrane proteins by their characteristic solubility at different ionic strengths. The solubilized membrane-associated enzymes, ATPase and NADH dehydrogenase, enter polyacrylamide gels as distict species. Electrophoretic studies suggest that there are two membrane-associated ATPase in the Streptococcus faecalis, one which dissociates from the membrane in the absence of Mg-2+ ions and the other which remains particulate until solubilized by detergents. Octyl glucoside can be easily removed from a solution containing solubilized proteins and lipid by dialysis.
TI  - Some observations on the caecal microflora of the chick during the first two weeks of life.
AB  - 1. Changes in the caecal flora of chicks aged from approximately 3 h to 14 d were studied. 2. Counts obtained by means of a conventional anaerobic plating method and a method for the stricter anaerobes remained comparable throughout but occasionally it was found that strains of anaerobic bacteria isolated from the predominant flora of 4- to 14-d-old birds could not be grown when tested by the conventional method. 3. During the 14-d period approximately 100% of the organisms isolated on anaerobic plates utilised uric acid up to the third day but the incidence subsequently declined and in one case represented only 4% of the total flora. 4. The predominant uric acid-utilising bacteria were Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli up to 3 d of age and various types of anaerobic bacteria thereafter. 5. None of the isolates showed an absolute requirement for uric acid.
TI  - Self-transferable plasmids determining the hemolysin and bacteriocin of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes, designated JH1 and JH3, produced a hemolysin and a bacteriocin. Hemolytic activity was lost from a low percentage of cells grown in broth at either 37 or 45 C. All nonhemolytic (Hly-) variants had lost bacteriocin activity (Ben-), and those from strain JH3 had also lost resistance to the bacteriocin (Bnr-). The majority of Hly-, Ben- variants from JH1 retained bacteriocin resistance (Bnrplus). Strains JH1 and JH3 contained a plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid species of molecular weight 38 times 10-6 (plasmids pJH2 and pJH3, respectively), and strain JH1 also contained a 50 times 10-6 molecular weight plasmid (pJH1) which has previously been shown to carry the genes determining resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Hly-, Bcn-, Bnr- variants of strain JH3 had completely lost plasmid pJH3. Hly-, Bcn-, Bnr- variants of strain JH1 had completely lost plasmid pJH2 and retained plasmid pJH1, but Hly-, Bcn-, Bnrplus variants had retained both plasmids pJH2 and pJH1. The Hlyplus, Bcnplus, Bnrplus traits from both parental strains were transferable to nonhemolytic S. faecalis strains during mixed incubation in broth at 37 C, and hemolytic recipient strains were found to have received plasmid pJH2 from strain JH1 and pJH3 from JH3. We conclude that the Hlyplus, Bnrplus traits are borne on plasmid pJH2 in strain JH1 and pJH3 in strain JH3 and that, in Hly-, Bcn-, Bnrplus variants of strain JH1, plasmic pJH2 has suffered a mutation affecting hemolysin and bacteriocin expression. We infer that the plasmids transfer by conjugation. Beta-hemolytic activity is the only property distinguishing the zymogenes variety from S. faecalis. Since we have shown that this activity is plasmid borne in strains JH1 and JH3, we endorse the view that the varietal status of zymogenes should be dropped.
TI  - Glycerophosphoryl phosphatidyl kojibiosyl diacylglycerol, a novel phosphoglucolipid from Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - 1. From Streptococcus faecalis a third novel phosphoglucolipid was isolated. It contained D-glucose, glycerol, acyl groups and phosphorus in a molar ratio of approx. 2 : 3 : 4 : 2. 2. The structure was shown to be 3(1)-O-[6 inches-(sn-glycerol-1-phosphoryl), 6 foot-(1,2 diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl)-2 foot-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-1(3),2-diacylglycerol. The novel lipid is related to the earlier described phosphatidyl and glycerophosphoryl kojibiosyl diacylglycerol from Streptococcus faecalis by combininb their substituents in its structure. 3. The structure of the deacylated core was accomplished by analyses of the breakdown products obtained on Smith degradation and strong alkaline hydrolysis. The location of the acyl groups was achieved by degradation of the intact lipid with 60% HF (w/v) which resulted in the formation of inorganic phosphate, glycerol, diacylglycerol and diglucosyl diacylglycerol. The sn-glycerol-1-phosphoryl and 3-sn-phosphatidyl substituents were located by hydrolysis of the lipid with 98% acetic acid (v/v) and subsequent analysis of the resultant phosphatidyl diglucosyl diacylglycerol. 4. The composition and positional distribution of the constituent fatty acids at the two diacylglycerol portions was studied by combination of chemical and enzymatic degradations. The fatty acids are the same as with the other polar lipids of S. faecalis, they are present in nearly the same proportions and display the same non-random distribution pattern. 5. A possible relationship between sn-glycerol 1-phosphate containing phosphoglucolipids and lipoteichoic acid will be discussed.

AB  - Tests made with a series of antibiotics against a number of different organisms indicate that if clinical evidence suggests a streptococcal infection, penicillin should be used otherwise erythromycin is preferred.
TI  - Factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of Escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of Bacteroides fragilis. Comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of E. coli or B. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable B. fragilis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus albus, Neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. Anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. Population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. The presence of dense cultures of B. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. Other factors inhibiting conjugation to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of B. fragilis in vivo. As well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of R factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.
TI  - Biosynthesis of ribosylthymine in the transfer RNA of Streptococcus faecalis: a folate-dependent methylation not involving S-adenosylmethionine.
AB  - Ribosylthymine is not present in tRNA of Streptococcus faecalis grown in the absence of folic acid, although this methylated residue does occur in the tRNA of this organism when it is grown in the presence of folate. We have found that, unlike other methylated residues in RNA of S. faecalis and other organisms, the methyl moiety of ribosylthymine of the tRNA of folate-sufficient S. faecalis is not derived from S-adenosylmethionine. Preliminary evidence suggests that a folate derivative serves as the methyl donor in this methylation.
TI  - The effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. III. Bacteriolysis induced by extracts of different leukocyte populations and the inhibition of lysis by macromolecular substances.
AB  - The lysis of 14C-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. While Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, Staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. Group A Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. The lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. Lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. The lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by KCN or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, DNA, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-L-glutamic acid. Other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.

AB  
TI  - Influence of environmental stress on enumeration of indicator bacteria from natural waters.
AB  - The problems associated with recovery of pure cultures of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis from stream environments were examined utilizing membrane filter chambers. It was observed that upon exposure to the aquatic environment a significant proportion of cells lost their ability to produce colonies on a selective medium, yet retained this capability on a nutritionally rich, nonselective medium. Discrepancies in colony-forming units between nonselective and selective media indicated that a substantial portion of bacterial cells may become physiologically injured due to the environmental stress imposed by the aquatic environment. The extent of injury was observed to vary considerably among the eight different stream environments, since the amount of injury was not uniform for all types of water environments examined. It was observed that the injury acquired by a population of E. coli, during exposure to the aquatic environment, could be rapidly repaired in a nutritionally rich, nonselective medium. As the injured population of cells was exposed to the rich, nonselective broth, increasing proportions of cells were able to repair themselves such that they became insensitive to inhibitory agents in selective media.
TI  - Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride. The covalently linked lipid constituent of the membrane lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790.
AB  - Water-soluble [14C]glycerol-labeled lipoteichoic acid isolated from the membrane  preparations of Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790 released chloroform-soluble radioactivity upon mild acid hydrolysis. Chromatography of the radioactive, chloroform-extractable material revealed the presence of a very polar lipid (lipid I). Depending upon the conditions of acid hydrolysis, lipid I accounted for as much as 92% of the total 14C-labeled lipids released. More stringent conditions of acid hydrolysis reduced the amount of lipid I and increased the quantity of the other lipids. Lipid I on further mild acid hydrolysis yielded phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride almost quantitively. The other lipids released from the lipoteichoic acid were kojibiosyl diglyceride, monoglucosyl diglyceride, monoglyceride, diglyceride, and phosphatidylmonoglucosyl diglyceride. These lipids are most likely the degradation products of phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride because they are all simpler, structural derivatives of the phosphoglucolipid and they increase in concentration with increasing acid hydrolysis. These and other data demonstrate that the glycerol phosphate polymer of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of S. faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790 is covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride.

The main species are bacillacees; then, come faecal streptococcus which are the best contaminations indicators; enterobacteries, yeasts, moulds spores, are exceptional. Dry products as getting old, entail a great decrease of all the species, the anaerobies being more resistant.

AB  - Studied were a total of 270 samples of raw and pasteurized milk taken during the  various technologic states of pasteurized mild produced for consumption at the State Economic Enterprise "Serdica", establishing the enterococcus and coli titers. It was found that the enterococcus titer of the raw milk varies from 10(-3) up to 10(-6), and the titer of the pasteurized milk at the enterprise and upon delivery through its commercial channels is from 1 up to 10(-3). The enterococcus titer of milk that was pasteurized and was kept for 24 hours at 4-5 degrees C was found to range from 1 to 10(-3), and of milk kept at 18-22 degrees C --from (0(-1) to 10(-6). Full coincidence of the enterococcus titer with the values of the coli titer was found only for pasteurized milk kept under refrigerator conditions. Along with the coli titer the enterococcus one may be used as a subsidiary means in a more strict bacteriologic control, however, it may not be referred to as the only criterion replacing the coli values in the hygiene evaluation of milk. All species of enterococci in varying counts are established in both raw and pasteurized milk. Prevailing are the strains of the Str. faecium group -- 43.2 per cent, and those of the Str. faecalis group -- 24.6 per cent.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium in infected dental root canals at filling and their susceptibility to azidocillin and some comparable antibiotics.
AB  - The study was performed on 612 routine cultures of material obtained from root canals of teeth at the time of filling (r-cultures) by students at the Department of Endodontics during a continuous period of one year. Twenty-nine isolates from 27 (29.3%) of the 92 positive cultures filled the criteria of enterococci (Sherman, 1937) and had demonstrable group D-antigen. With a set of tests these isolates were identified as follows: Strep. faecalis subsp. faecalis (10), Strep. faecalis subsp. zymogenes (3), Strep. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens (8), atypical variants of Strep. faecalis (6), Strep. faecium var. faecium (1) and Strep. faecium var. durans (1). Five tests in the present study clearly differentiated Strep. faecalis from Strep. faecium i.e. fermentation of sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobic) and melezitose, tolerance to potassium tellurite (0.1%) (positive for Strep. faecalis) and production of hydrogen peroxide (positive for Strep. faecium). In the inocula 10(3) or more colony forming units of enterococci were found more often of other identified microorganisms. This means that enterococci are of special interest in studies on the influence of infection at the time of filling of root canals on the prognosis of root canal therapy. The isolates were also tested for susceptibility to azidocillin, ampicillin, penicillin-G, penicillin-V and erythromycin with the paper disc method. All the isolates were susceptible to azidocillin and ampicillin (sensitivity group I), while the majority of the isolates showed a lower susceptibility to the other three antibiotics (sensitivity group II). The significance of these findings in the choice of prophylactic antibiotic to prevent bacterial endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease are discussed, when bacteremia from dental procedures may be expected.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus.
AB  - The antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. Healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. Cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. Cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. The strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus faecalis. Use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. The use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms, with the exception of M. lysodeicticus. The maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.

TI  - Simple technique for the assay of antibiotic synergism against enterococci.
AB  - A simple technique with antibiotic-impregnated disks has been developed to demonstrate the antibiotic synergism of penicillins and aminoglycosides against enterococci. The two antibiotic disks are placed on inoculated plates so that the distance between their centers is less than the sum of the two radii of their previously determined inhibitory zones. After 5 h of incubation, beta-lactamase powder is dusted onto the susceptibility plate with a sterile cotton swab. After overnight incubation, the synergistic effect of the antibiotics is demonstrated by a clear area of no growth in between the two disks. There is good correlation between the synergism determined by this procedure and the susceptibility of the organisms to 2 mg of streptomycin per ml. This technique is simple and can be employed by any laboratory which performs Kirby-Bauer susceptibility procedures.
TI  - Equine anti-hapten antibody. IX. IgM anti-lactose antibodies.
AB  - The immune response to a bacterial vaccine of Streptococcus faecalis (strain N) was characterized in all of the seven horses studied by the sustained production of about 90% IgM anti-lactose antibody over a period of 44 weeks with maximum values of the total antibody ranging from 4 mg/ml of serum to 12 mg/ml of serum. With respect to the binding of a lactose-containing ligand the association constants of the antibodies purified from sera obtained between 5 and 44 weeks fell in the range of 1 times 10-5 M-1 to 2 times 10-5 M-1. Not only was there no significant indication of maturation of a-finity in this period but there was a selective limitation of affinity compared to that of 7S antibodies. It was inferred that the synthesis of IgM antibody involves the selective utilization of V-H and/or V-L genes.
TI  - Synthesis and microbiological activities of some monohalogenated analogs of tyrosine.
AB  - 2-Chlorotyrosine and 2-bromotyrosine, as well as the previously reported 2-fluorotyrosine, were synthesized by hydrolysis of the condensation products from the appropriate benzyl bromide and ethyl acetamidomalonate and were compared with the corresponding 3-halotyrosines as growth inhibitors of Escherichia coli 9723, Streptococcus faecalis 8043 and Lactobacillus plantarum 8014. In contrast to the 2- and 3-fluorotyrosines which were equally effective as growth inhibitors, the 2-chloro- and 2-bromotyrosines were much more effective than the 3-chloro- and 3-bromotyrosines in inhibiting the growth of the three microorganisms. For each of the assay organisms, the growth inhibitions of all three 2-halotyrosines were reversed competitively in varying degrees by tyrosine.

TI  - Studies of substructure and tightly bound nucleotide in bacterial membrane ATPase.
AB  - Highly purified preparations of Streptococcus faecalis ATPase contain a similar but inactive protein detected by prolonged polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The inactive protein appears to arise by proteolytic cleavage of the major subunits in the enzyme. By use of a new technique, subunit analysis in SDS gels was performed on the enzyme band and the inactive protein band excised from a polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis. The results indicated that the ATPase has the composition alpha3beta3gamma in which alpha = 60,000, beta = 55,000, and gamma = 37,000 daltons. The inactive protein appears to have the composition (f)6 in which f = 49,000 daltons. There is also evidence that the enzyme band contains some slightly modified forms of the ATPase, such as alpha3beta2 (f)gamma. The inactive protein lacks the capacity for tight nucleotide binding. Our experiments show that the tight ATPase-nucleotide complex formed in S. faecalis cells (the endogenous complex) behaves differently from the tight complex formed in vitro (the exogenous complex). We prepared a doubly labeled complex containing endogenous 32P-labeled ADP and ATP and exogenous 3H-labeled ADP. We observed that the addition of free nucelotide to the doubly labeled ATPase displaced the exogenous bound ligand from the enzyme but not the endogenous bound nucleotide. We suggest that the displaceable and nondisplaceable forms of the tight ATPase-nucleotide complex correspond to two different conformational states of the enzyme.

TI  - Bacterial flora of the appendix fossa in appendicitis and postoperative wound infection.
AB  - Bacteria were isolated from 153 (47.5%) swabs of the appendix fossa in 322 patients undergoing appendicectomy. The commonest organism was Bacteroides species found in 78% of specimens. Other Gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella, or Enterobacter, and Esch. coli were present in 29 and 27% respectively. Gram-positive cocci were less frequently isolated.A positive culture was obtained more commonly in perforated appendicitis (79%) than where chronic fibrosis, lymphoid hyperplasia, or acute appendicitis was present or when the appendix was normal. Bacteroides was isolated twice as often in perforated appendicitis. The incidence of wound infection was 19% and varied according to the state of the appendix, being 63% in perforated appendicitis and 9.5% where lymphoid hyperplasia was present. Bacteroides was isolated from over 90% of the wound infections. In the patients with perforated appendicitis where effective chemotherapy was given the incidence of wound infection was 15% whereas in untreated or inappropriately treated patients it was over 50%. The isolation of bacteroides requires special precautions to be taken both in the collection of the specimen and laboratory culture. It is important that the chemotherapy of postappendicectomy infections include an antibiotic active against bacteroides.

TI  - Proposed reproductive cycle for a relatively stable L-phase variant of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Based on electron microscopic observations, the reproductive cycle of a relatively stable L-phase variant of Streptococcus faecalis was proposed. The small, dense, nonvesiculated L-form is envisioned as the central (core) element. It was seen to divide and bud rapidly. In addition, the dense forms appeared to be capable of growth and development within vesicles of mature mother forms. When these forms were released from the vesicles into the surrounding fluid medium, further growth occurred, resulting in the development of immature and ultimately mature mother forms. Under conditions unfavorable for L-form growth, these dense forms developed first into transitional forms and then into the bacterial form. These dense forms might therefore be considered as undifferentiated "stem cells' with the capacity to develop along several different routes, depending upon the stimulus received.
TI  - Demonstration of the phenomena of microbial persistence and reversion with bacterial L-forms in human embryonic kidney cells.
AB  - A series of experiments was undertaken in which human embryonic kidney (HEK) fibroblasts were infected with either relatively stable or stable L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis. The infected cells were maintained by splitting over long periods (1 to 2 months) while samples were withdrawn for culture and electron microscopic studies. Relatively stable S. faecalis L-forms could be cultured from infected cells only during the first week after infection, although L-form-like material was frequently detected at later periods by electron microscopy. HEK cells continued to proliferate and showed no gross histopathology until reversion occurred. At reversion, electron microscopy revealed the presence of intracellular L-forms, transitional variants, and intra- and extracellular bacterial forms. Unlike relatively stable L-forms, stable L-forms were culturable throughout the experimental period. These experiments demonstrate the phenomena of persistence and reversion in vitro. Electron microscopy indicated that the L-forms entered the HEK cells, where they underwent morphological changes. Observations suggested that these altered L-forms (elementary bodies) persisted in the cell until reversion to the parent bacterial form was triggered. Infected cells, when treated with L-form antiserum and stained with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum, were consistently positive regardless of cultural findings.

Broth cultures of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis (approximately 4 x 10(8) organisms) were sealed in lengths of capillary tubing and attached to the surface of the pans. In other tests, pans were contaminated with an artificial soil containing Str. faecalis (10(8) organisms/ml). In both series of tests, counts of surviving organisms were made at the end of the washing and disinfection cycle. The tests using capillary tubes showed that the Gram-negative bacilli were effectively killed, but not necessarily Gram-positive cocci. However, when incorporated in standard soil, Str. faecalis was killed or removed during the cycle. The results indicate that the disinfection process was effective for metal bedpans, but less so for polypropylene. Possible disadvantages and modification of the machine are suggested.
TI  - Improved isolation and differentiation of enterococci in cheese.
AB  - Further documentation of an enterococcus selective differential (ESD) medium was  obtained in isolations from eight different cheeses. An improved differentiation of tetrazolium salt (2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium hydrochloride [TTC])-reducing strains of Streptococcus faecalis from TTC-nonreducing or TTC-faintly-reducing Streptococcus faecium was attained. The sensitivity of the medium was evaluated in comparison with that of KF streptococcal, Pfizer selective enterococcus (PSE), the medium of Reinbold, Swern, and Hussong (RSH), and the medium of Saraswat, Clark, and Reinbold (SCR). Selective counts, rate of colony formation, and ease of isolation and differentiation of colonies were examined. The specificity of the medium was also investigated. ESD supported the fastest rate of growth and the maximum size of colonies; counts in this medium were in most cases possible with 17 h of incubation, whereas the other media required 24 to 48 h. A presumptive identification of 1,077 isolates by four biochemical tests disclosed that SCR, RSH, and ESD selected high, comparable percentages of strains that approximated most closely the typical description of enterococci (66, 60.1, and 58%, respectively). Low percentages (21.1 and 30.7%) were yielded by KF and PSE. The utility of ESD for a rapid, presumptive identification of enterococci was confirmed by serological and biochemical testing of color TTC-differentiated colonies isolated from 18 cheeses.
TI  - Development of a selective enterococcus medium based on manganese ion deficiency, sodium azide, and alkaline pH.
AB  - Rogosa broth, without its salt supplement and dissolved in deionized water, was adapted for the selective isolation and enumeration of enterococci. This medium supported good growth of enterococci, but it suppressed growth of other lactic acid bacteria. The sensitivity and specificity of the medium were tested after addition of various increasing concentrations of NaN(3) against known strains of enterococci and other bacteria. Many strains of Streptococcus faecium showed low azide tolerance; optimal growth was obtained at a concentration of 0.01% NaN(3), which totally or partially inhibited unrelated species of lactic acid bacteria. The selectivity of the medium was further increased by pH adjustment to 9.6. Carbonate and Tween 80 were added to overcome partial inhibition of enterococcal growth by the new combination of selective conditions. The final medium was evaluated in agar form in isolations from human and animal feces, polluted water, meat, and dairy products. Counts were obtained after 16 to 17 h of incubation at 37 C. The isolates satisfactorily conformed to the group characteristics of enterococci.

TI  - Hematogenous Streptococcus faecalis pyelonephritis in the rat. A histologic, immunopathologic and bacteriologic study.
AB  - The demonstration of bacterial antigens in active pyelonephritis in man has been  inconsistent. In this paper we have studied 110 rats with experimental pyelonephritis induced by a single intravenous injection of Streptococcus faecalis. The animals were studied at intervals up to 1 year; bacteremia, urine and renal parenchymal bacterial counts were monitored. In these animals it was observed that bacteriuria and positive bacterial cultures of renal tissue persisted up to 1 year in some rats. Bacteria and their antigenic products in small foci were detected by immunofluorescence in the pyelonephritic lesions. The highly focal distribution of the bacterial antigens in bacteriologically positive tissues of this model suggest the need for careful fixation technics, availability of large tissue specimens and careful control of immunologic factors. These specific requirements to detect bacterial antigens may preclude the practical study of human pyelonephritic kidneys.

AB  - In normal human serum chelated with magnesium (10 mM) and ethylene glycotetraacetic acid (10 mM) (MgEGTA), the classical pathway of complement activation is blocked; however, the alternate pathway of complement activation is intact. Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Serratia marcescens were opsonized in normal human serum containing 10 mM MgEGTA. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were poorly opsonized in human serum chelated with 10 mM MgEDTA. Therefore certain bacterial species appear to require the classical pathway of complement activation to be opsonized and other bacterial species utilize the alternate pathway of complement activation.
TI  - Effect of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide on growth and membrane-mediated processes in wild type and heptose-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - The effects of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) on the growth of Streptococcus faecalis, and on the growth, beta-galactosidase synthesis, and various membrane-mediated processes, were studied in wild-type Escherichia coli JE1011 and its lipopolysaccharide-defective mutant NS1. DCCD (0.1 mM) completely inhibited the growth of S. faecalis and E. coli NS1 but had little effect on strain JE1011. The same amount of DCCD with E. coli NS1, but not with E. coli JE1011, inhibited the induction of beta-galactosidase, increased the permeability of the cells to o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside without causing extensive cell lysis or release of ultraviolet-absorbing materials, and inhibited the oxidation of certain intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibition of the oxidation of malate, fumarate, and alpha-ketoglutarate by DCCD appeared to be at the level of the transport system for these compounds. Inhibition of the membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase by DCCD was not entirely responsible for these effects, since oxidation of these substances, and transport of [(14)C]succinate and [(14)C]fumarate, was inhibited by DCCD in a mutant, N(144), which lacked adenosine triphosphatase activity. It is concluded that lipopolysaccharide forms a barrier to DCCD in wild-type E. coli, and that DCCD can inhibit several processes in the cell.

AB  - 1. The effects of injected l-methionine (2g every second day for 28 days) on liver folates and other constituents of liver associated with folate metabolism were studied in vitamin B(12)-deficient ewes and their pair-fed controls receiving vitamin B(12). The dose rate of methionine used was sufficient to restore almost to normal the elevated excretion in the urine of formiminoglutamate in the deficient animals. 2. Liver folates active for Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis R and Pediococcus cerevisiae were severely depressed in deficient livers and were partly restored by methionine. Analysis of the folates after ion-exchange chromatography showed that the major effect of methionine was to increase the concentrations of tetrahydrofolates and formyltetrahydrofolates. Methyltetrahydrofolates were also increased, but there was no effect of methionine on the small amounts of incompletely reduced folates present in deficient livers. The folates present were predominantly penta-, hexa- and hepta-glutamates whether or not animals received vitamin B(12) or methionine. 3. Concentrations of ATP, NAD(+), NADH and NADPH were lower in freeze-clamped liver from vitamin B(12)-deficient sheep than in liver from pair-fed, vitamin B(12)-treated sheep. These changes were not affected by methionine which was also without effect on the elevated K(+)/Na(+) ratios found in deficient livers. 4. The livers of vitamin B(12)-deficient animals contained lower concentrations of choline and higher concentrations of lipid than their pair-fed controls. These effects were reversed by methionine.

Two cis isomers of the C(30) analogue of neurosporene are described. 4. An appropriate system of nomenclature for these novel compounds is proposed.

At 80 C the radiation response of the spore preparations was the same as at room temperature, whereas the radiation resistance of the preparations with the two vegetative strains was reduced. At 100 C the radiation response of preparations with spores of B. subtilis was unaffected by the high temperature, whereas at 16 and and 25 krad/h the radiation resistance of the radiation-resistant sporeformer B. sphaericus, strain C(I)A, was reduced to the level of radiation resistance of preparations with spores of B. subtilis. It is concluded that combinations of heat and gamma irradiation at the temperatures and dose rates tested may have very few practical applications in sterilization of medical equipment.
TI  - Effect of temperature on the distribution of membrane particles in Streptococcus  faecalis as seen by the freeze-fracture technique.
AB  - When cells of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were incubated at temperatures above 10 C before being frozen for freeze-fracture, a random distribution of particles was observed on the outer fracture face of the freeze-cleaved cell membrane. However, when cells were incubated below 10 C before freezing, particleless patches were seen on this membrane surface. The size of the patches produced on chilling could be increased by centrifugation or by storing the chilled cells overnight at about 3 C. Patch formation appeared readily reversible, since the medium and large patches that formed on chilling could not be observed in cells warmed for 10 s at 25 C. However, during the transition from the patch to patchless state, smaller patches not seen in the chilled cells were observed. This suggested that the smaller patches might have been intermediate forms produced by the fragmentation of larger patches on warming.
TI  - Factors influencing the frequency of mesosomes observed in fixed and unfixed cells of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Mesosomes of Streptococcus faecalis (American Type Culture Collection 9790) were  seen about 92% less frequently in freeze fractures of unfixed cells than in freeze fractures and sections of fixed cells. This difference in frequency was not related to any period of unbalanced macromolecular synthesis induced by chemical fixation. All measured synthetic processes (DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and glycerol incorporation) were halted with either osmium tetroxide (OS) or glutaraldehyde fixation. That fewer mesosomes were seen in freeze fractures of unfixed cells was probably due to the difficulty of observing cross-fractured mesosomes in this organism in the unfixed state. Unfortunately, mesosomes probably preferentially cross fracture in the unfixed state and therefore are usually only observed, infrequently, in those cases where the freeze fracture follows the surface layer of a mesosomal membrane. However, the addition of glycerol to unfixed cells, especially in the chilled state, greatly increased the frequency of observation of cytoplasmic mesosomes in freeze fractures. It is thought that glycerol, like chemical fixation, increases the number of surface-fractured mesosomes, which in turn increases the frequency of mesosome observation. It was also observed that cellular autolysis occurring during OS fixation seemingly reduced the number of mesosomes observed in thin sections and freeze fractures of OS-fixed cells.

TI  - Autolytic formation of protoplasts (autoplasts) of Streptococcus faecalis 9790: release of cell wall, autolysin, and formation of stable autoplasts.
AB  - A system for the formation of apparently wall-free protoplasts from exponential-phase cells of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 in the absence of added lytic enzymes was developed. Exponential-phase cells suspended in 0.04 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.7, 1 mM magnesium acetate, and 0.5 M sucrose become osmotically fragile within 1 to 1.5 h due to the action of the native, autolytic enzyme on the cell wall peptidoglycan. However, maximal cell wall loss occurred much more slowly, being complete only after 3 to 6 h. Under these conditions, the autolytically formed protoplasts (autoplasts) remained intact for prolonged periods (up to 24 h) with less than 5% of their deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein lost during the first 6 h. During dissolution of the cell wall, release of autolytic enzyme to the supernatant fluid began after 60% of the wall was lost. The addition of trypsin to the incubation mixture increased the rate of attainment of osmotic fragility and cell wall loss two- to threefold, apparently due to the activation of the latent form of the autolysin. Electron microscopy was used to confirm cell wall loss and the presence of intact protoplasts at the end of the incubation periods.
TI  - Effect of inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis on the direction of cell wall growth in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Selective inhibition of protein synthesis in Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) was accompanied by a rapid and severe inhibition of cell division and a reduction of enlargement of cellular surface area. Continued synthesis of cell wall polymers resulted in rapid thickening of the wall to an extent not seen in exponential-phase populations. Thus, the normal direction of wall growth was changed from a preferential feeding out of new wall surface to that of thickening existing cell surfaces. However, the overall manner in which the wall thickened, from nascent septa toward polar regions, was the same in both exponential-phase and inhibited populations. In contrast, selective inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis using mitomycin C was accompanied by an increase in cellular surface area and by division of about 80% of the cells in random populations. Little or no wall thickening was observed until the synthesis of macromolecules other than DNA was impaired and further cell division ceased. Concomitant inhibition of both DNA and protein synthesis inhibited cell division but permitted an increase in average cell volume. In such doubly inhibited cells, walls thickened less than in cells inhibited for protein synthesis only. On the basis of the results obtained, a model for cell surface enlargement and cell division is presented. The model proposes that: (i) each wall enlargement site is influenced by an individual chromosome replication cycle; (ii) during chromosome replication peripheral surface enlargement would be favored over thickening (or septation); (iii) a signal associated with chromosome termination would favor thickening (and septation) at the expense of surface enlargement; and (iv) a factor or signal related to protein synthesis would be required for one or more of the near terminal stages of cell division or cell separation, or both.

TI  - Initiation of protein synthesis by folate-sufficient and folate-deficient Streptococcus faecalis R: partial purification and properties of methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase and methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid formyltransferase.
AB  - The initiation of protein synthesis by Streptococcus faecalis R grown in folate-free culture occurs without N-formylation or N-acylation of methionyl-tRNA(f) (Met). Methionyl-tRNA synthetase and methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase were partially purified from S. faecalis grown under normal culture conditions in the presence of folate (plus-folate); the general properties of the enzymes were determined and compared with the properties of the enzymes purified from wild-type cells grown in the absence of folate (minus-folate). S. faecalis methionyl-tRNA synthetase displays optimal activity at pH values between 7.2 and 7.8, requires Mg(2+), and has an apparent molecular weight of 106,000, as determined by gel filtration, and 127,000, as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The K(m) values of plus-folate methionyl-tRNA synthetase for each of the three substrates in the aminoacylation reaction (l-methionine, adenosine triphosphate, and tRNA) are nearly identical to the respective substrate Michaelis constants of minus-folate methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Furthermore, both plus- and minus-folate S. faecalis methionyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze, at equal rates, the aminoacylation of tRNA(f) (Met) and tRNA(m) (Met) isolated from either plus-folate or minus-folate cells. S. faecalis methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase displays optimal activity at pH values near 7.0, is stimulated by Mg(2+), and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 29,900 when estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The K(m) value of plus-folate formyltransferase for plus-folate Met-tRNA(f) (Met) does not differ significantly from that of minus-folate formyltransferase for minus-folate Met-tRNA(f) (Met). Both enzymes can utilize either 10-formyltetrahydrofolate or 10-formyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate as the formyl donor; the Michaelis constant for the monoglutamyl pteroyl coenzyme is slightly less than that of the triglutamyl pteroyl coenzyme for both transformylases. Tetrahydrofolate and uncharged tRNA(f) (Met) are competitive inhibitors of both plus- and minus-folate S. faecalis formyltransferase; folic acid, pteroic acid, aminopterin, and Met-tRNA(m) (Met) are not inhibitory. These results indicate that the presence or absence of folic acid in the culture medium of S. faecalis has no apparent effect on either methionyl-tRNA synthetase or methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, the two enzymes directly involved in the formation of formylmethionyl-tRNA(f) (Met). Therefore, the lack of N-formylation of Met-tRNA(f) (Met) in minus-folate S. faecalis is due to the absence of the formyl donor, a 10-formyl-tetrahydropteroyl derivative. Although the general properties of S. faecalis methionyl-tRNA synthetase are similar to those of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, S. faecalis methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase differs from other previously described transformylases in certain kinetic parameters.

AB  - The Autoturb System, a semiautomated system for photometric bioassay, was used to determine cefazolin content. Suitable conditions for the assay using Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 10541 as the indicator organism included a medium pH of 6.0 to 7.0 and an incubation time of 3 to 3.5 h at 36 C. Multiple independent assays of samples from a common batch showed the test to be highly reproducible. Accuracy of the turbidimetric assay was evaluated by comparing data obtained from a chemical (hydroxylamine) and a biological (disk diffusion) assay. The available data show the turbidimetric assay to be a rapid, accurate, and reproducible method for determining the biological activity of cefazolin samples.
TI  - Lactic acid translocation: terminal step in glycolysis by Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis obtains metabolic energy chiefly from the conversion of glucose to lactic acid; the present experiments deal with the mechanism of lactic acid translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. Efflux of [(14)C]lactate from preloaded cells was accelerated by raising the external pH, and also by the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin. These results suggest that lactate leaves the cell by an electroneutral process, presumably as lactic acid. Further evidence was obtained by studying the entry of [(14)C]lactate into nonmetabolizing cells. It appears that the membrane is essentially impermeable to the lactate anion, but allows passage of lactic acid. The most persuasive evidence is that, upon establishment of a pH gradient such that the cytoplasm was alkaline, l-[(14)C]lactate accumulated in the cells against the concentration gradient. Accumulation was transient, and dissipated in parallel with the collapse of the pH gradient. The concentration gradient attained at the peak was a function of the pH difference. Ionophores which are known to collapse a pH gradient, such as nigericin and valinomycin, abolished accumulation of l-lactate. We infer that lactic acid translocation, whether into the cells or outward, is an electroneutral process and for that reason the distribution of lactic acid across the membrane is a function of the pH of cytoplasm and medium. The specificity of translocation and its kinetic parameters suggest that it is mediated by a carrier of low specificity.

TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid-borne multiple antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes, designated JH1, had high-level resistance to the antibiotics streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. These resistances were lost en bloc from approximately 0.1% of cells grown in nutrient broth at 45 C. The frequency of resistance loss was not increased by growth in the presence of the "curing" agents acriflavine or acridine orange, but after prolonged storage in nutrient agar 17% of cells became antibiotic sensitive. Covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules were isolated from the parental strain and from antibiotic-sensitive segregants by using cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients. DNA molecular species were identified by using neutral sucrose gradients. Strain JH1 contained two covalently closed circular DNA species of molecular weights 50 x 10(6) and 38 x 10(6). An antibiotic-sensitive segregant, strain JH1-9, had lost the larger molecular species. A second sensitive segregant, strain JH1-5, had also lost the larger molecular species but a new molecular species of approximate molecular weight 6 x 10(6) was present. The antibiotic resistances that were curable from the parental strain were transferred to antibiotic-sensitive strains of S. faecalis and to strain JH1-9, during mixed incubation in nutrient broth at 37 C. Data to be described are interpreted to suggest that the transfer is by a conjugal mechanism. Analysis of the plasmid species in recipient clones showed that all had received the plasmid of molecular weight 50 x 10(6). Strain JH1-5 was not a good recipient. Analysis of one successful recipient clone of JH1-5 revealed that it had gained the 50 x 10(6) molecular weight plasmid but lost the 6 x 10(6) molecular weight species. These data are interpreted to mean that the multiple antibiotic resistance is borne by a transferable plasmid of 50 x 10(6) molecular weight, and that in clone JH1-5 this plasmid suffered a large deletion leaving only a 6 x 10(6) remnant which was incompatible with the complete replicon.

AB  - A statistical method for quantifying the relatedness among proteins was used to perform 2926 paired comparisons of amino-acid composition among 77 contractile and membrane-associated proteins from diverse species and sources. Relatedness of amino-acid compositions correlates with homology of amino-acid sequence. A high degree of relatedness was detected among K(+)-dependent membrane ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis, coupling factors F(1) and CF(1) from mitochondria and chloroplasts, outer fiber protein of cilia, ciliary dynein, tubulin, various actins, and myosin subfragment S-1. Heavy meromyosin and tropomyosin were related to each other but not to the first group of proteins. Differences in the degree of methylation may account for some differences in physiological function. Because of their diverse sources, the high degree of relatedness among these proteins is more compatible with evolution from common ancestral genes than with convergent evolution. Squid axon filarin, molluscan paramyosin, and bacterial flagellins appear to be unrelated either to each other or to any of the other proteins studied. Existence of persistent homologies among so many diverse proteins implies conservation of genetic information during evolution by utilization of codons for preferred amino-acid sequences in various proteins.

TI  - Identification and measurement of the folates in sheep liver.
AB  - 1. Methods are described for the extraction, separation by ion-exchange chromatography and estimation by microbiological assay of the folates in sheep liver. 2. Injection of [2-(14)C]-pteroylglutamate into a sheep fed on a stock diet led to extensive labelling of chromatographically separable liver folates. About 12% of the label in the liver could not be extracted by the method used. 3. Liver folates were examined in five ewes fed on restricted amounts of a diet of wheaten hay-chaff and gluten and injected weekly with vitamin B(12). Chromatographic separation was followed by microbiological assay with Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis R. and Pediococcus cerevisiae both before and after treatment of fractions with conjugase (gamma-glutamylcarboxypeptidase). Evidence was obtained that the folates present were predominantly polyglutamate forms of tetrahydropteroylglutamate, 5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate and 5- (and 10-) formyltetrahydropteroylglutamates. Differences in the responses of the assay organisms permitted quantitative distinction between these three main classes of folates. 4. Methyltetrahydrofolates were eluted in seven successive peaks that were separated by constant increments in the logarithm of eluant [P(i)]. A similar relationship existed for seven successive peaks of tetrahydrofolate and may also have existed for each of the two series of formyltetrahydrofolates. 5. Based on these and other observations it is proposed that sheep liver folates consist predominantly of the mono- to hepta-glutamates of each of the reduced pteroates identified. The methods employed allowed quantitative determinations to be made of most of the folates present. The predominant forms were hexaglutamates. 6. Four components active for L. casei were detected that could not be identified. Three of them were polyglutamates.
TI  - NH2-terminal amino acid distribution and amino acid composition of Streptococcus  faecalis R soluble and ribosomal proteins.
AB  - The NH(2)-terminal amino acid distribution of Streptococcus faecalis R soluble and ribosomal proteins isolated from cells at different stages of growth on either folate-sufficient or folate-deficient medium was determined by the dinitrophenyl method. The NH(2)-terminal residues do not follow the random distribution observed for the total amino acid composition of S. faecalis soluble and ribosomal proteins. Methionine and alanine occur most frequently; serine, threonine, aspartic and glutamic acids, and glycine are also present at the NH(2)-terminal position of S. faecalis R proteins. The absence of folic acid yields cells that are incapable of formylating methionyl-transfer ribonucelic acid tRNA(f) (Met), but does not affect either the qualitative or quantitative NH(2)-terminal distribution of total soluble or total ribosomal proteins compared to cells grown with folate. A small quantitative difference was observed in the frequency of distribution of certain amino acids at the NH(2)-termini between log and stationary phase soluble proteins. The amino acid residues found at the NH(2)-terminal position of S. faecalis proteins are qualitatively similar to those reported for several other organisms.

TI  - Comparison of several laboratory media for presumptive identification of enterococci and group D streptococci.
AB  - Bile-esculin (Difco), modified bile-esculin (Difco), selective enterococcus (Pfizer Co.), and eosin-methylene blue agar media were evaluated for accuracy in identifying group D streptococci. The regular and modified bile-esculin media performed equally well, but the selective enterococcus and eosin-methylene blue agars did not accurately differentiate the group D from non-group D streptococci. A modified 6.5% NaCl broth was compared with unmodified 6.5% NaCl broth and Streptococcus faecalis (SF; Difco) broth for accuracy in differentiating enterococci from non-enterococci. The modified and unmodified broths worked equally well in the salt tolerance test, but the lot-to-lot variability of SF broth made this medium unusable as an indicator for enterococci. With all seven media, the number of strains giving positive tests decreased when the tests were incubated at 45 C as compared with 35 C, and the number of strains giving negative tests increased. Thus, the number of false-positive identifications decreased, but the number of false-negative identifications increased. Variability in the susceptibility of group D non-enterococcal streptococci to oxacillin and methicillin sensitivity disks limited the usefulness of these tests for presumptive identification of either enterococci or group D streptococci.

AB  - Kanamycin, BB-K8, and gentamicin were tested in parallel against 1,037 bacterial  strains isolated from clinical material. The activity of BB-K8 at 20 mug/ml was comparable to that of gentamicin at 8 mug/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of gentamicin-resistant strains of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii, in which case the activities of BB-K8 and kanamycin were the same. BB-K8 exhibited little or no activity against streptococci. The activity of BB-K8 was affected by pH and inoculum size. A regression graph for inhibition data with a 10-mug disk of BB-K8 was developed, and synergistic activity of penicillin and BB-K8 against Streptococcus faecalis was tested.

TI  - Fatty acid composition of L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis cultured at different osmolalities.
AB  - The fatty acid composition of the membranes of three different penicillin-produced L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis was determined: (i) a stable (nonreverting) L-form (T(53)) cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) with 0.5 M sucrose; (ii) a stable L-form (T(531)) cultured in BHI without sucrose; and (iii) an unstable L-form (T(9)) cultured in BHI with 0.5 M sucrose and 1,000 U of penicillin per ml. L-forms were obtained by centrifugation and lysed by washing in 1 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer. The parent S. faecalis was also cultured in BHI and BHI containing 0.5 M sucrose, and washed with buffer. The fatty acid composition of L-forms of S. faecalis cultured in BHI without sucrose (370 mosmol) had higher C(18:1) and lower C(18) than L-forms cultured in the same media with added 0.5 M sucrose (950 mosmol) in both exponential and stationary cultures. In the stationary phase of growth, C(19) was reduced in the L-forms cultured without sucrose. Similar changes were seen in the parent S. faecalis cultured in the two types of media. These changes in membrane fatty acids may relate to osmo-regulation of the L-forms.

Phosphatidylglycerol is one of the major radioactive lipids synthesized and contains an equal amount of radioactivity in each of its two glycerol moieties.
TI  - Role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of guanidinosuccinic acid.
AB  - Among a variety of bacteria isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of rats and humans, only streptococci of group N are capable of degrading guanidinosuccinic acid added to their culture medium. The urinary excretion of guanidinosuccinic acid by germfree rats is greater than that of conventional rats. The excretion of this compound by gnotobiotic rats correlates with the capacity of their intestinal microflora to degrade guanidinosuccinic acid in culture. Thus, guanidinosuccinic acid excretion is low in rats infected exclusively with Streptococcus faecalis, and the excretion is not altered when germfree rats are infected with an organism unable to degrade guanidinosuccinic acid (Lactobacillus). These findings suggest that the intestinal microflora, particularly Streptococcus, play a role in the metabolism of guanidinosuccinic acid by the host.
TI  - Induction of superoxide dismutase by molecular oxygen.
AB  - Oxygen induces superoxide dismutase in Streptococcus faecalis and in Escherichia  coli B. S. faecalis grown under 20 atm of O(2) had 16 times more of this enzyme than did anaerobically grown cells. In the case of E. coli, changing the conditions of growth from anaerobic to 5 atm of O(2) caused a 25-fold increase in the level of superoxide dismutase. Induction of this enzyme was a response to O(2) rather than to pressure, since 20 atm of N(2) was without effect. Induction of superoxide dismutase was a rapid process, and half of the maximal level was reached within 90 min after N(2)-grown cells of S. faecalis were exposed to 20 atm of O(2) at 37 C. S. faecalis did not contain perceptible levels of catalase under any of the growth conditions investigated by Stanier, Doudoroff, and Adelberg (23), and the concentration of catalase in E. coli was not affected by the presence of O(2) during growth. S. faecalis, which had been grown under 100% O(2) and which therefore contained an elevated level of superoxide dismutase, was more resistant of 46 atm of O(2) than were cells which had been grown under N(2). E. coli grown under N(2) contained as much superoxide dismutase as did S. faecalis grown under 1 atm of O(2). The E. coli which had been grown under N(2) was as resistant to the deleterious effects of 50 atm of O(2) as was S. faecalis which had been grown under 1 atm of O(2). These results are consistent with the proposal that the peroxide radical is an important agent of the toxicity of oxygen and that superoxide dismutase may be a component of the systems which have been evolved to deal with this potential toxicity.
TI  - Acid-base titration of streptococci and the physical states of intracellular ions.
AB  - Acid titrations of intact and butanol-treated cells of Streptococcus faecalis revealed that nearly all of the intracellular K(+) ions could diffuse into the suspending medium in association with small anions, including ribonucleic acid breakdown products, when the cell membrane was damaged. In contrast, nearly all of the intracellular Mg(2+) ions appeared to be firmly bound to stable internal cell components but could be displaced reversibly by hydronium ions. The cell membrane acted as a barrier to ion movements, and Mg(2+) displacement from intact cells required more acid conditions, by as much as 2.5 pH units, than did displacement from butanol-damaged cells. Some 15 to 20% of the cell magnesium appeared to be associated with surface structures in that it could be removed at pH 7 with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or displaced by Co(2+), Ni(2+), Sr(2+), or La(3+). Magnesium could be displaced from isolated cell walls and membranes by hydronium ions in the pH range from 5 to 3, over which carboxyl groups were titrated. Displacement of magnesium from ribosomes also took place between pH 5 and 3, but it was more difficult to identify the magnesium-releasing groups because both protein carboxyl groups and purine and pyrimidine ring nitrogens can become protonated in this pH range. Isolated protoplast membranes remained structurally intact when completely depleted of magnesium. Furthermore, protoplasts isolated from intact cells were found to have greatly enhanced resistance to osmotic shock in acid media, even when solute loss was not extensive. Osmotic resistance was lost when the protoplasts were again placed in neutral media, and this reversibility suggested that acidification caused changes in the physical properties of membranes as well as solute leakage from cells.
TI  - Recurrent urethritis in women.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the vestibule, urethra and vagina of a group of patients with recurrent urethritis, and of control subjects without symptoms, was investigated. Organisms regarded as pathogenic, such as enterobacteria and Streptococcus faecalis, were recovered significantly more frequently from patients than from controls, whereas the reverse was found for non-pathogenic organisms. The bacterial flora was similar in the three areas, suggesting that a specimen taken from one region only would give adequate bacteriological information. The vestibule is suggested as a suitable site. The incidence of vestibular pathogens was higher in postmenopausal patients. Perineal length and vestibular pH were very similar in patient and control groups. There was some evidence that in most subjects the bacterial flora of the areas investigated remains fairly constant over a period of several weeks. Although bacterial species commonly responsible for urinary tract infection may often cause recurrent urethritis, the absence of these pathogens from some patients suggests that the etiology of this condition is not yet fully understood.

AB  - Combinations of penicillin plus tobramycin have been compared with penicillin plus gentamicin against 27 strains of enterococci isolated from blood cultures. Penicillin plus gentamicin was synergistic against all strains. The combination of penicillin plus tobramycin was equally effective against strains of Streptococcus facalis, but was ineffective against all four strains of S. faecium tested.
TI  - Present significance of resistance to trimethoprim and sulphonamides in coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The incidence of trimethoprim resistance in coliforms and multiresistant strains  of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in Bristol from 1970 to 1972 is low-2.3 and 1.0% respectively. The resistance is probably intrinsic; there is no evidence that it is R-factor or plasmid mediated. A single mechanism that confers resistance to both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole has not been detected. Normal growing one-step mutants of S. aureus and Escherichia coli resistant to trimethoprim could not be isolated in vitro. For these reasons cotrimoxazole should retain its usefulness against these bacteria for some years. However, contrimoxazole was found not to be bactericidal against many coliforms. The usefulness of cotrimoxazole against Streptococcus faecalis seems limited because mutants resistant to trimethoprim occurred at high frequency in one step.

TI  - Electric conductivity and internal osmolality of intact bacterial cells.
AB  - Intact cells of Streptococcus faecalis and Micrococcus lysodeikticus were found to have high-frequency electric conductivities of 0.90 and 0.68 mho/m, respectively. These measured values, which reflect movements of ions both within the cytoplasm and within the cell wall space, were only about one-third of those calculated on the basis of determinations of the amounts and types of small ions within the cells. Concentrated suspensions of bacteria with damaged membranes showed similarly large disparities between measured and predicted conductivities, whereas the conductivities of diluted suspensions were about equal to predicted values. Thus, the low mobilities of intracellular ions appeared to be interpretable in terms of the physicochemical behavior of electrolytes in concentrated mixtures of small ions and cell polymers. In contrast to the low measured values for conductivity of intact bacteria, values for intracellular osmolality measured by means of a quantitative plasmolysis technique were higher than expected. For example, the plasmolysis threshold for S. faecalis cells indicated an internal osmolality of about 1.0 osmol/kg, compared with a value of only 0.81 osmol/liter of cell water calculated from a knowledge of the cell content and the distribution of small solutes. In all, our results indicate that most of the small ions within vegetative bacterial cells are free to move in an electric field and that they contribute to cytoplasmic osmolality.
TI  - Platelet interaction with bacteria. 3. Ultrastructure.
AB  - The interaction of several common strains of bacteria with rabbit or human platelets in vitro has been examined sequentially with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Bacteria were added to platelets in their native plasma or to washed platelets in a balanced salt solution at ratios of about 1:1 or at low bacteria to platelet ratios (down to 1:100). The platelet-bacterial interaction (PBI) was studied with recording nephelometry. Matched samples were fixed for microscopy at various points in the aggregation response. The results support these conclusions: a) Bacteria stimulate platelet aggregation by direct contact and adhesion with the platelet surface. b) Adhesion between the two cell types requires divalent cations, occurs through fusion of normal cell-surface coats and appears identical in the presence or absence of extracellular plasma protein. c) The morphologic transformation of platelets during PBI is identical to that produced by collagen. d) During PBI the bacteria are incorporated into the forming platelet aggregates and reside predominantly intercellularly. e) Phagocytosis of bacteria by a single platelet is very rare. f) Bacteria which have resided within platelet aggregates for one hour are unaltered morphologically. g) PBI occurs even at very low bacterial numbers and produces platelet-bacterial aggregates in small numbers without stimulating generalized platelet aggregation. Methods for concentration of thrombocytopenic plasma and washing human platelets are presented.

TI  - Occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  - Analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium. A close correlation was demonstrated between the content of N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. These lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of N-acetylation with acetic anhydride. Thus, the occurrence of the N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. The N-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus arabinosus.

Strains of S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and a motile yellow-pigmented streptococcus, contained very low levels of C(19:0) cyclopropane fatty acid and four unidentified components, compared to the other strains of enterococci examined. There were no significant differences in the fatty acid patterns of enterococci grouped according to plant, animal, or human source.

AB  - Enterococci were obtained from 213 of 403 insects cultured during a 14-month period, in numbers from 10(3) to 3 x 10(7)/g of insect. Insects were taken only from nonurban, wild, and cultivated fields and woods. In species of insects carrying them, enterococci were not always present in every individual cultured, and often more than one species of enterococcus occurred within a species. Enterococci were obtained from certain insects taken in the field during the dormant season, suggesting their role as overwintering agents. They were generally present in species feeding on nectar, succulent plant parts, and on and ir forest litter, but not from insects feeding on less succulent leaves and stems. Streptococcus faecalis was recovered from 32%, Streptococcus faecium from 22.4%, and Streptococcus faecium var. casseliflavus from 43.5% of members of the 37 taxa of insects. S. faecalis and S. faecium var. casseliflavus exhibit a high percent of conformity to the properties published for them. The heterogeneity in properties of S. faecium is similar to that found for the species taken from plants. Many fail to grow in broth at 45 C or in broth containing 6.5% NaCl; 50% of the cultures ferment both melezitose and melibiose, and a few ferment neither sugar. The remainder ferment melibiose only. Failure to reduce methylene blue in milk by S. faecalis and S. faecium is correlated with the inability to ferment lactose. More than 93% of the cultures of S. faecalis digest casein in milk from the top downward, following the production of a soft, flowing curd. Because this property is not characteristic of S. faecalis taken from humans, the reaction in litmus milk is suggested as a means of differentiation between cultures of remote and innocent origin in nature and recent, human pollution.

TI  - Influence of macromolecular biosynthesis on cellular autolysis in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The addition of several different antibiotics to growing cultures of Streptococcus faecalis, ATCC 9790, was found to inhibit autolysis of cells in sodium phosphate buffer. When added to exponential-phase cultures, mitomycin C (0.4 mug/ml) or phenethyl alcohol (3 mg/ml) inhibited deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, but did not appreciably affect the rate of cellular autolysis. Addition of chloramphenicol (10 mug/ml), tetracycline (0.5 mug/ml), puromycin (25 mug/ml), or 5-azacytidine (5 mug/ml) to exponential-phase cultures inhibited protein synthesis and profoundly decreased the rate of cellular autolysis. Actinomycin D (0.075 mug/ml) and rifampin (0.01 mug/ml), both inhibitors of ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, also reduced the rate of cellular autolysis. However, the inhibitory effect of actinomycin D and rifampin on cellular autolysis was more closely correlated with their concomitant secondary inhibition of protein synthesis than with the more severe inhibition of RNA synthesis. The dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis by 5-azacytidine was quickly diluted out of a growing culture. Reversal of inhibition was accompanied by a disproportionately rapid increase in the ability of cells to autolyze. Thus, inhibition of the ability of cells to autolyze can be most closely related to inhibition of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the rapidity of the response of cellular autolysis to inhibitors of protein synthesis suggests that regulation is exerted at the level of autolytic enzyme activity and not enzyme synthesis.

There was complete agreement between in vitro sensitivity and clinical response except in the case of one strain of Streptococcus fecalis. The combination of drugs was effective against some bacterial strains which were resistant to the commonly used antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Growth of Streptococcus faecium in the presence of lysozyme.
AB  - Streptococcus faecium can grow normally in the presence of lysozyme, despite the  observation that cell suspensions of the organism are lysed readily by the enzyme. Growth in the presence of lysozyme is not due to resistant cells, and the culture is lysed after growth if the pH of the medium is not allowed to drop too low for lysozyme activity. Growth followed by lysis in the presence of lysozyme was not exhibited by other organisms tested which were either significantly more resistant or more sensitive to lysozyme than S. faecium. Lysozyme was active on the cell wall of S. faecium during growth in the presence of 200 mug of the enzyme per ml in a complex medium. It appears that, when actively metabolizing, S. faecium can synthesize the cell wall at a greater rate than lysozyme can hydrolyze it. Thus, the organism is capable of growth in the presence of the enzyme. A large variation in the lytic responses of enterococcal cell suspensions to lysozyme was dependent on the strain used, the growth phase from which the culture was harvested, and the medium in which the culture was grown.
TI  - Experimental Shigella infections in laboratory animals. I. Antagonism by human normal flora components in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant Shigella flexneri strain. Antagonism against Shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with Escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with Bacteroides fragilis. A moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either Streptococcus faecalis or Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Shigella persisted in the cecal contents of E. coli-associated mice at very low, stable levels. Shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with E. coli and Bacteroides. Upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, Bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. The E. coli population was greatly reduced, and Shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled E. coli biochemically. A streptomycin-resistant E. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. Shigella concomitantly declined to levels below detection.
TI  - Quantitative sputum culture as a means of excluding false positive reports in the routine microbiology laboratory.

All six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. Only S. aureus and P. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. L. acidophilus, S. faecalis, and B. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the serum proteins. P. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.
TI  - Evaluation and standardization of an agglutination test for human listeriosis.
AB  - Human sera from patients with culturally confirmed listeriosis were tested for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) agglutinating antibodies with trypsinized antigens of Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The response of humans to listeria infections is mainly IgM rather than IgG as found in animals. The antigens prepared from L. monocytogenes serotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 4b, and 4d were evaluated for specificity with normal sera, sera from patients with various other diseases, and sera from patients with listeriosis. The trypsinized antigens appeared to be specific for listeria antibodies with a cross-reaction rate of from 5.4 to 6%. Cross-reaction with S. aureus can be eliminated by absorption of the serum with S. aureus. This agglutination technique appears to be applicable for diagnostic testing, but, as with all serological procedures, both acute and convalescent sera should be tested.
TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

Intracellular localization of L-frms was confirmed by electron microscopy. In timed experiments, phagocytosis of a group D Streptococcus (ATCC 23241) and its L-form (T53I) were maximal at 30 min, although the bacteria were consistently better phagocyted. Phagocytosis of an Escherichia coli (strain Yale) and its L-form was also demonstrated with the same technique. The lesser phagocytosis of L-forms may be related to their lower chemotactic activity.
TI  - Localization and interconversion of tetrahydropteroylglutamates in isolated pea mitochondria.
AB  - 1. Mitochondria were extracted from 4-day-old pea cotyledons and purified on a sucrose density gradient. 2. Microbiological assay of the purified mitochondrial fraction with Lactobacillus casei (A.T.C.C. 7469), Streptococcus faecalis (A.T.C.C. 8043) and Pediococcus cerevisiae (A.T.C.C. 8081) revealed a discrete pool of conjugated and unconjugated derivatives of tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid. 3. Solubilization and chromatographic studies of the mitochondrial fraction demonstrated the presence of formylated and methylated derivatives, 10-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid, 5-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid and 5-formyltetrahydropteroyldiglutamic acid being the major derivatives present. 4. The principal mitochondrial pteroylglutamates were labelled when dry seeds were allowed to imbibe [2-(14)C]pteroylglutamic acid and 5-[methyl-(14)C]-methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid. 5. The ability of isolated mitochondria to catalyse oxidation and reduction of tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid derivatives was demonstrated in feeding experiments in which [(14)C]formaldehyde, [3-(14)C]serine, sodium [(14)C]formate, 5-[methyl-(14)C]methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid or [2-(14)C]-glycine served as C(1) donor. In addition, (14)C was incorporated into free amino acids related to C(1) metabolism.

AB  - In-vitro sensitivities were performed on 140 specimens of urine which grew Streptococcus faecalis of more than 100 000 organisms/ml between March 1970 and February 1971. Although the combination of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole definitely appeared to be more effective than sulphonamide alone and as effective as ampicillin, its use for more than two weeks in 14 cases of uncomplicated urinary tract infection due to Streptococcus faecalis led to development of resistance. As in these cases organisms were resistant to sulphonamide to start with, it is suggested that the combination should be used in prolonged treatment only where the organisms are sensitive to both the individual antibiotics. Ampicillin is still the drug of choice in urinary tract infection due to Streptococcus faecalis. The alternative appears to be rotational therapy with other potent antibiotics.
TI  - Folate metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The possibility that the inability of Streptococcus faecalis to utilize 5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate or pteroyltriglutamate might be due to permeability was investigated. Whereas the former was taken up by S. faecalis cells growing on pteroylglutamic acid, the latter was not. No subsequent conversion of the 5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate took place and accumulation, which was against a considerable concentration gradient, was inhibited by fluoride. It would thus appear to be an active process.

AB  - Remarkable tolerance to prolonged heating, prolonged storage, and bacterial proliferation was exhibited by staphylococcal thermonuclease in foods and broth. A purified enzyme preparation added to Brain Heart Infusion broth was unaffected by the growth of five bacterial species. Minimal inactivation was effected by Bacillus subtilis. Optimal growth of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquifaciens caused extensive inactivation of thermonuclease. However, storage at room temperature or the addition of 5% NaCl caused only minimal inactivation.
TI  - Osmotic stability and sodium and potassium content of L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A stable L-form of Streptococcus faecalis (T(53)) was transferred in media containing decreasing concentrations of sucrose until it grew in medium without added osmotic stabilizer. This L-form (designated T(53I)) was compared with T(53) from which it was derived. The survival of these two L-forms suspended at different osmolalities showed that maximal survival for T(53I) was 350 to 400 milliosmolal and for T(53) was 900 to 1,000 milliosmolal. Both peaks were at the osmolality of their growth media. Measurement of intracellular potassium and sodium showed that the concentration of these ions was reduced in T(53I).
TI  - The lipid-teichoic acid complex in the cytoplasmic membrane of Streptococcus faecalis N.C.I.B. 8191.
AB  - 1. A lipid-teichoic acid complex was isolated from Streptococcus faecalis N.C.I.B. 8191. The covalent nature of the linkage between teichoic acid and lipid was established. 2. The complex exhibits macromolecular properties in solution, and ultracentrifugation studies show that these are due to micelle formation. 3. From chemical studies it is concluded that the teichoic acid is a poly(glycerol phosphate) in which some of the glycerol hydroxyl groups possess kojibiosyl [2-O-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-d- glucopyranosyl] substituents, together with d-alanine ester residues. 4. The lipid is 1-kojibiosyl diglyceride, already known as a membrane component of this organism, with probably a phosphatidyl substituent. The phosphatidyl kojibiosyl diglyceride is attached to the teichoic acid through a phosphodiester linkage, and the chain of the teichoic acid contains 28-35 units. 5. Although the complex represents the whole of the membrane teichoic acid in this organism, only about 12% of the membrane glycolipid is associated with teichoic acid. 6. Two phosphatidyl glycolipids, closely resembling that bearing the teichoic acid, were isolated from the lipids of the organism and were partly characterized.

TI  - Complete deficiency of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective bactericidal activity.
AB  - A 52 yr old Caucasian female (F. E.) had hemolytic anemia, a leukemoid reaction,  and fatal sepsis due to Escherichia coli. Her leukocytes ingested bacteria normally but did not kill catalase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. An H(2)O(2)-producing bacterium, Streptococcus faecalis, was killed normally. Granule myeloperoxidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and beta glucuronidase activities were normal, and these enzymes shifted normally to the phagocyte vacuole (light and electron microscopy). Intravacuolar reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium did not occur. Moreover, only minimal quantities of H(2)O(2) were generated, and the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) was not stimulated during phagocytosis. These observations suggested the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. However, in contrast to control and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was completely absent in F. E. leukocytes whereas NADH oxidase and NADPH oxidase activities were both normal. Unlike chronic granulomatous disease, methylene blue did not stimulate the hexose monophosphate shunt in F. E. cells. Thus, F. E. and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes appear to share certain metabolic and bactericidal defects, but the metabolic basis of the abnormality differs. Chronic granulomatous disease cells lack oxidase activity which produces H(2)O(2); F. E. cells had normal levels of oxidase activity but failed to produce NADPH due to complete glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. These data indicate that a complete absence of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective hexose monophosphate shunt activity is associated with low H(2)O(2) production and inadequate bactericidal activity, and further suggest an important role for NADPH in the production of H(2)O(2) in human granulocytes.

AB  - Overnight cultures of V. cholerae, V. el tor, non-cholera vibrio, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in tryptone-soya broth (with 5% blood added for the last-named) failed to grow on subculture despite visible growth in all tubes. Viable counts and pH determinations of overnight cultures of various species in tryptone-soya broth, brain-heart infusion broth, and Lab-Lemco peptone broth show that death in tryptone-soya broth is associated with the drop in pH resulting from fermentation of glucose in the medium and that this drop is greater than that produced by the same amount of glucose in brain-heart infusion broth. Some strains of pneumococci failed to grow in brain-heart infusion broth and it is suggested that both these media are unsuitable for blood cultures.
TI  - Morphokinetic reaction of cells of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) to specific inhibition of macromolecular synthesis: dependence of mesosome growth on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis.
AB  - The application of quantitative electron microscopy to thin sections of cells of  Streptococcus faecalis specifically inhibited for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis shows that septal mesosomes (i) increase in size when protein synthesis is inhibited by at least 80% while DNA synthesis proceeds at no less than 50% of the control rate and (ii) decrease in size when DNA synthesis is inhibited 50% or more during the initial 10 min of treatment. This indicates that fluctuations in mesosome size are dependent on the extent of DNA synthesis. The fluctuations in mesosome areas observed on treatment do not correlate with the kinetics of glycerol incorporation per milliliter of a culture. However, when glycerol incorporation is placed on a per cell basis, a strong correlation is observed between increases in (i) the thickness of the electron-transparent layer of the cytoplasmic membrane and (ii) the amount of glycerol incorporated per cell. It seems that the electron-transparent membrane layer may thicken to accommodate changes in lipid content when protein and lipid synthesis are uncoupled.
TI  - Morphokinetic reaction of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) cells to the specific inhibition of macromolecular synthesis: nucleoid condensation on the inhibition of protein synthesis.
AB  - In glutaraldehyde-prefixed exponential-phase cells of Streptococcus faecalis the  nucleoid is "frozen" in a dispersed configuration. Exposure of exponential-phase cells to threonine starvation or to antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis resulted in progressive condensation of nucleoid fibrils producing an expanding central nucleoid zone or pool. The condensation of the nucleoid was observed to occur at a rate directly proportional to the rate of inhibition of protein synthesis. However, the extent of nucleoid condensation depended on continuing deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. Significantly less nucleoid condensation occurred when cells were inhibited in deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis than when cells were inhibited in protein synthesis alone. These results suggest a model in which, during nucleoid replication, the chromosome fibrils are normally maintained in a dispersed state by the active agents of transcription-translation, such as ribonucleic acid polymerase molecules and ribosomes.

TI  - Fermentation of agmatine in Streptococcus faecalis: occurrence of putrescine transcarbamoylase.
AB  - Putrescine transcarbamoylase, EC 2.1.3.x (carbamoylphosphate:putrescine transcarbamoylase), has been purified from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 grown on agmatine as primary energy source. The formation of N-carbamoylputrescine from putrescine and carbamoylphosphate serves as a convenient and sensitive assay for this enzymatic activity. The enzyme catalyzes both the phosphorolysis arsenolysis of N-carbamoylputrescine. Arginine does not induce the synthesis of putrescine transcarbamoylase in S. faecalis. Furthermore, the putrescine transcarbamoylase activity is easily separated from ornithine transcarbamoylase activity by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 indicating that the two activities are associated with different proteins. The significance of this new enzyme in the fermentation of agmatine and its relation to the other known transcarbamoylases are discussed.
TI  - Transport of lysine and hydroxylysine in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Data are presented which support the view that l-lysine is transported by two systems in Streptococcus faecalis. The system with the higher affinity for l-lysine appears to be specific for l-lysine among the common amino acids and to require an energy source. The second system transports both l-lysine and l-arginine and does not appear to require an energy source. Both of these systems will accept hydroxy-l-lysine as a substrate as shown by the energy requirement for hydroxy-l-lysine transport and by the inhibition of uptake by l-arginine as well as by l-lysine. The affinity of both systems appears to be considerably lower for hydroxy-l-lysine than for l-lysine. A mutant of S. faecalis which is resistant to the growth inhibitory action of hydroxy-l-lysine appears to differ from the parent strain by having a defective l-lysine-specific transport system. In this mutant, hydroxy-l-lysine is not readily transported via the l-lysine-specific system because of the mutation or via the second system because of the high concentration of l-arginine present in the growth medium. This overall lack of transport prevents hydroxy-l-lysine from reaching inhibitory levels within the cell.

TI  - Induction and regulation of a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-specific 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis grown with glucose as the primary energy source contains a single, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-specific 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Extracts of gluconate-adapted cells, however, exhibited 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity with either NADP or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). This was shown to be due to the presence of separate enzymes in gluconate-adapted cells. Although both enzymes catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate, they differed from one another with respect to their coenzyme specificity, molecular weight, pH optimum, K(m) values for substrate and coenzyme, and electrophoretic mobility in starch gels. The two enzymes also differed in their response to certain effector ligands. The NADP-linked enzyme was specifically inhibited by fructose-1,6-diphosphate, but was insensitive to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and certain other nucleotides. The NAD-specific enzyme, in contrast, was insensitive to fructose-1,6-diphosphate, but was inhibited by ATP. The available data suggest that the NAD enzyme is involved primarily in the catabolism of gluconate, whereas the NADP enzyme appears to function in the production of reducing equivalents (NADPH) for use in various reductive biosynthetic reactions.

AB  - The isolation and some properties of two mutants of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 (S. faecium) which autolyze at a much slower rate than the wild type are described. Compared with the wild type, mutant E71 autolyzed more slowly, contained less active but more latent autolysin in the isolated wall fraction, and possessed a wall of very similar chemical composition and degree of cross-bridging. Ultrastructural studies of exponential phase cells showed that cells of E71 were on the average slightly longer and had slightly thickened walls compared to the wild type. Mutant E81 autolyzed much more slowly, grew exponentially in long chains (8 to 40 cells compared with mainly diplococci), contained much less active and latent autolysin in the wall, and possessed a wall of very similar chemical composition but with about twice the content of N-terminal groups. Mutant E81 walls were more susceptible to isolated autolysin but possessed an autolysin of the same specificity as the wild type. Ultrastructurally E81 cells were, on the average, significantly longer and had thicker walls than the wild type. Mutant E71 may be partially blocked at either transport of autolysin to the wall or in conversion of latent to active autolysin. The pleitropic effects noted in mutant E81 have been taken to suggest a possible membrane defect and to support the role of the autolysin in cell separation.

No observable differences could be found between the size of the leucine precursor pools of the two cultures. The extent of turnover of protein and ribonucleic acid in both "protoplast" and streptococcal cultures appeared to be identical. Finally, the absolute rate of macromolecular biosynthesis was found to be equivalent whether determined on the basis of "new" or "old" label incorporation.
TI  - Studies on antibiotic syngerism against enterococci. II. Effect of various antibiotics on the uptake of 14 C-labeled streptomycin by enterococci.
AB  - The mechanism by which agents that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis produce  a synergistic effect against enterococci when combined with aminoglycoside antibiotics has not been elucidated. Using (14)C-labeled streptomycin, it could be shown that uptake of this aminoglycoside antibiotic was markedly enhanced in enterococci growing in the presence of penicillin or other agents which inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. There was no enhancement of streptomycin uptake when the cells were incubated with antibiotics which primarily affect the bacterial cell membrane or inhibit protein synthesis. Increased streptomycin uptake was produced by penicillin only in actively growing bacteria. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that enterococci exhibit a natural barrier to the entry of streptomycin which can be overcome by agents which inhibit cell wall synthesis, thus producing a synergistic effect.

AB  - 1. The concentrations of pteroylglutamate derivatives in the cotyledons of pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings were determined by microbiological assay by using Lactobacillus casei (A.T.C.C. 7469), Streptococcus faecalis (A.T.C.C. 8043) and Pediococcus cerevisiae (A.T.C.C. 8081). During germination the pteroylglutamate content of the cotyledons increased rapidly from 0.2mug/g dry wt. to 4.0mug/g dry wt., the maximum values being reached approx. 120h after imbibition. 2. Approx. 50% of the pteroylglutamate pool of 3-day-old seedlings was accounted for by highly conjugated derivatives. The concentrations of such derivatives were greatest when precautions were taken to inactivate endogenous enzymes before extraction of the tissues. 3. Individual derivatives present in the tissue extracts were separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Synthesis of the major derivative, 5-methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate, was inhibited by administration of 0.1mm-aminopterin and -amethopterin solutions during imbibition. Under these conditions pteroylglutamic acid accumulated in the tissues. 4. Feeding experiments employing [2-(14)C]pteroylglutamic acid and 5[(14)C]-methyltetrahydro-pteroylmonoglutamic acid revealed that both compounds were incorporated into conjugated and unconjugated derivatives of the pteroylglutamate pool.

TI  - Platelet interaction with bacteria. II. Fate of the bacteria.
AB  - Several common strains of bacteria have been studied to determine their influence on human and rabbit platelets in vitro. Bacteria at a nominal ratio of 1:1 were added to platelets in their native plasma or to platelets in a balanced salt solution. The platelet-bacterial interaction was examined by nephelometry and by sequential light microscopy of fixed specimens taken at key points in the reaction. The results support the following conclusions: (1) Bacteria that were potent stimuli of the platelet aggregation reaction were incorporated in large numbers into the forming platelet aggregates. (2) Bacteria sequestered within platelet aggregates remained in direct contact with the aggregated platelet mass for up to 1 hour in vitro and during this time showed no morphologic changes by light microscopy. (3) Plateletbacterial interaction produced clumping of the bacteria but no demonstrable killing of the microorganisms. (4) Collagen-platelet interaction resulted in release of platelet products that were capable of clumping bacteria but were not lethal to them. (5) Rabbit and human platelets showed no species differences in plateletbacterial interaction. (6) Washed platelets interacted with bacteria without added serum factors but the addition of serum accelerated the aggregation reaction.

Results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) Bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) The platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) The degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) Direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) By adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with Staphylococcus being the most powerful.
TI  - Quantitative studies on the salivary flora.

It is suggested that knowledge of the relative numbers of the organisms that comprise the salivary flora will lead to a greater understanding of the ecology of the mouth and of the pathogenesis of oral infections.

AB  - A new method for the enumeration of lymphoid cells with specific surface-receptors for antigen is described, based on the use of beta-D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), either directly as an antigen or as a conjugated antigen. Binding of beta-D-galactosidase is revealed by its activity in releasing riboflavin from a synthetic substrate, riboflavin-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The riboflavin, inactive as a vitamin in the galactosidic form, becomes active when released by the enzyme, and can be detected by bioassay. Hence, lymphoid cells with receptors for beta-D-galactosidase on their surface can be detected after they have been exposed to the enzyme, washed, and then plated in agar containing riboflavin-beta-D-galactopyranoside, streptomycin, riboflavin-deficient medium, and a streptomycin-resistant strain of Streptococcus faecalis that requires riboflavin. Release of riboflavin is signalled by the growth of characteristic bacterial colonies over the cell that bound beta-D-galactosidase.
TI  - Detection of relationships between Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei by immunological studies with two forms of malic enzyme.
AB  - Antisera prepared against two isologous malic enzymes from Lactobacillus casei strains 64H and M40 were used to survey and categorize the various malic enzymes found within this diverse species. In addition to detecting three major antigenic variants of malic enzyme within this group, both antisera readily reacted with Streptococcus faecalis malic enzyme. The cross-reactions between the L. casei malic enzyme antisera and the S. faecalis malic enzyme indicated that these iso-functional enzymes found in two apparently diverse groups of organisms were immunologically homologous. A scheme proposing a common ancestry for the two species S. faecalis and L. casei based on the results of quantitative immunological studies is presented.
TI  - Studies on the absorption and metabolism of folic acid. I. Folate absorption in the dog after exposure of isolated intestinal segments to synthetic pteroylpolyglutamates of various chain lengths.
AB  - Folic acid absorption was studied in anesthetized dogs by determining the amount  and chemical nature of folate in venous blood emerging from isolated intestinal segments containing free folic acid and/or pteroylpolyglutamates of a known chain length. Chromatographically pure test materials placed in the lumen were prepared by unambiguous solid phase synthetic methods. This synthetic procedure not only yields compounds of known structure, it also provides a means by which glutamic acid residues at any given position in the gamma glutamyl chain can be made radioactive. For example, teropterin (pteroyltriglutamate) was synthesized in such a way that (14)C was present only in the middle glutamic acid unit. Suitable placement of label permitted assessment of the extent of peptide cleavage. The action of plasma conjugase was inhibited by copper chloride. Plasma samples were analyzed by Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis assay, by column chromatography, and by quantitative measurement of pteridine-bound radioactivity. It was observed that biologically active folate appeared in the mesenteric vein with either pteroylmono-, di-, tri-, penta-, or heptaglutamate in the lumen. Generally speaking the absorption rate appeared to be inversely related to the length of the gamma glutamyl side chain. Roughly twice as much folic acid appeared in the circulation from (3)H-labeled pteroylmonoglutamate as from (14)C-labeled pteroylpentaglutamate when equimolar amounts of each were placed simultaneously in a single intestinal segment. Pteroylmonoglutamate appeared to be the predominant form entering the blood from each of the precursors tested. However, evidence was obtained that pteroyldiglutamate may enter the mesenteric vein soon after placing pteroyldi-, or triglutamate in the lumen, but not with the higher polyglutamates. Comparison of radioactivity and biological activity patterns suggests little conversion, if any, to reduced or methylated forms during the first 30 min of passage through the intestinal mucosa. We conclude that both pteroylmonoglutamates and pteroyldiglutamates may across the intestinal mucosa of the dog, and that reduction and methylation are not essential to the absorption process.

The bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as Flavobacterium peregrinum, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. Nicotinamide-7-(14)C ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. These results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.

TI  - Media exchange method for demonstrating killing of L-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  - Normal human serum has been shown to kill L-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. Previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. This failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and NaCl. A method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some L-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. Using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the L-phase variants of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi. This method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for L-phase variants.
TI  - Differential action of a streptococcal bacteriocin on mycoplasmas and microbial L-forms.
AB  - Bacteriocin activity of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was tested against  a variety of bacteria, L-forms, and mycoplasmas. Both a partially purified liquid preparation and a colony overlay technique were used. Other S. faecalis strains were the only bacteria whose growth was inhibited. The liquid preparation inhibited growth of all but three of the tested L-forms (whether derived from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria), and two of these exceptional organisms were inhibited when the colony overlay technique was employed. On the other hand, the L-form of Streptobacillus moniliformis and all 33 tested mycoplasmas grew readily in the presence of the bacteriocin when either method was employed. It is suggested that the presence of cholesterol in the Streptobacillus and mycoplasmal membranes, unique in this regard among procaryotic cells, may be responsible for the differential pattern of growth inhibition.

TI  - Characteristics of a bacteriocin derived from Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes antagonistic to Diplococcus peumoniae.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing strain of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes (E-1) was isolated from clinical material (conjunctiva). The active substance differed from bacteriocins described by other investigators primarily in its spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially by its marked inhibition of Diplococcus pneumoniae. The E-1 bacteriocin also inhibited nonhemolytic strains of enterococci as well as one-third of the Viridans group of streptococcal strains investigated. The degree of inhibition, however, as indicated by the size of the zones against the latter organisms, was significantly reduced. No activity was detected against any of the strains belonging to the following groups of bacteria: hemolytic enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and various gram-negative species. Similarly, three strains each of Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes and one strain of Erysipelothrix insidiosa were not inhibited. The bacteriocin was able to diffuse through bacterial membranes as well as cellulose dialyzer tubing. It was inactivated by heating to 80 C for 20 min but resisted inactivation by either trypsin or chloroform.

TI  - An enzyme-based theory of obligate anaerobiosis: the physiological function of superoxide dismutase.
AB  - The distribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase has been examined in various micro-organisms. Strict anaerobes exhibited no superoxide dismutase and, generally, no catalase activity. All aerobic organisms containing cytochrome systems were found to contain both superoxide dismutase and catalase. Aerotolerant anaerobes, which survive exposure to air and metabolize oxygen to a limited extent but do not contain cytochrome systems, were found to be devoid of catalase activity but did exhibit superoxide dismutase activity. This distribution is consistent with the proposal that the prime physiological function of superoxide dismutase is protection of oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the potentially detrimental effects of the superoxide free radical, a biologically produced intermediate resulting from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen.
TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  - Mechanism for regulating the distribution of glucose carbon between the Embden-Meyerhof and hexose-monophosphate pathways in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Glucose-adapted Streptococcus faecalis produced little if any (14)CO(2) from glucose-1-(14)C, although high levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44) were detected in cell-free extracts. Metabolism of glucose through the oxidative portion of the hexose-monophosphate pathway was shown to be regulated in this organism by the specific inhibitory interaction of the Embden-Meyerhof intermediate, fructose-1, 6-diphosphate (FDP), with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was unaffected by FDP. The S. faecalis 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was partially purified from crude extracts by standard fractionation procedures and certain kinetic parameters of the FDP-mediated inhibition were investigated. The negative effector was shown to cause a decrease in V(max) and an increase in the apparent K(m) for both 6-phosphogluconate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These effects were apparently a consequence of the ligand interacting with the enzyme at a site distinct from either the substrate or the coenzyme sites. Among the evidence supporting this was the fact that beta-mercaptoethanol blocked completely FDP inhibition, but had no effect on catalytic activity. The possibility that the regulation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity by FDP might be of some general significance was suggested by the observation that this enzyme from several other sources was also sensitive to FDP.

TI  - Comparative biochemical and immunological study of malic enzyme from two species  of lactic acid bacteria: evolutionary implications.
AB  - Representatives of both Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei produce isofunctional malic enzymes. All 10 strains of S. faecalis tested could be induced to synthesize malic enzyme and readily adapted to growth on malate. Although 17 of 21 L. casei strains could be induced to produce malic enzyme, only 9 of 14 strains tested grew at the expense of malate. A comparison of catalytic and regulatory properties suggested that the malic enzymes from S. faecalis and L. casei were very similar. Immunological analyses showed that the numerous similarities in function actually reflected partial protein homologies; however, two distinct forms of the malic enzyme were detected among different strains of L. casei by immunochemical and serological procedures. The division of L. casei into two subgroups based on the immunological type of malic enzyme synthesized corresponds to two subspecies currently recognized by microbial taxonomists.

AB  - Osmotically fragile forms of Streptococcus faecalis 9790 were grown in 0.5 m sucrose- or 0.5 m NH(4)Cl-stabilized medium. The "protoplast" cultures exhibit an average growth rate constant of 0.66 to 0.94 mass doublings/hr. In a variety of experiments, turbidity and the net content of protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid increase at the same rate, indicating balanced macromolecular biosynthesis. A total of two to three mass doublings was obtained, with no evidence of cell division. After osmotic shock, "protoplast" cultures released 93 to 94% of their RNA content in a form not sedimentable at 12,800 x g for 15 min, in contrast to streptococci, which released 7% of their RNA content after the same treatment.

AB  - Cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were starved of threonine for 10 hr  and then allowed to reinitiate growth in a fresh complete medium. On regrowth, culture turbidity began to increase within 10 min, but the ability of cells to autolyze did not begin to increase until after 30 min. Ultrastructural studies of regrowth of the initially thick-walled cells showed, at about 30 min, centripetal linear extension of new thin cross wall. This was followed, at about 40 min, by a notching, splitting, and peeling apart of the base of the cross wall. After this, extension of new thin peripheral wall from the nascent cross wall appeared to push old thick wall toward the poles. After the first cell division, asymmetric cells with one initial generation thick-walled pole and one second generation thin-walled pole were seen. After two divisions, thick-walled hemispheres were still seen, suggesting conservation of old wall during this time. A small fraction of the initial cell population exhibited aberrations and difficulties in reinitiating linear wall extension and were useful in the establishment of a model for the reinitiation of linear wall extension.

AB  - Injury of test cultures was quantitated by differences in colony counts obtained  with a complete medium and those obtained on conventional selective media. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and several strains of Escherichia coli were injured when exposed to the quaternary ammonium compound methylalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride. Representative hypochlorite sanitizers also caused injury of E. coli ML30. Sanitizer concentration appeared to be the main factor in the cause of death and injury, a higher concentration being needed to cause death. Increases in temperature did not result in substantial increases in injury; however, the lethal effect was greater at higher temperatures. Varying the cell concentration from 10(7) to 10(9) cells per ml did not change the fraction of cell population killed or injured. The inability or failure of common selective media to detect injured bacteria in food could have serious public health consequences.

AB  - Fixation of NaH(14)CO(3) by a heavy cell suspension of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens was studied. Several nutrients, pyridoxal, riboflavine, adenine, uracil, and O(2) stimulated (14)CO(2) incorporation into cells only under conditions that were adequate for synthesis of cell macromolecules. Biotin increased CO(2) incorporation in the absence of extensive synthesis of macromolecules, whereas O(2) inhibited incorporation under these conditions. When (14)CO(2) fixation was occurring during synthesis of macromolecules, 71% of the (14)C was incorporated into cells and 29% occurred extracellularly. Ninety-three per cent of the cellular (14)C was in protein and 5.5% was in nucleic acid. Aspartic acid was the only amino acid in the protein fraction that was radioactive. Eighty-three per cent of the extracellular (14)C was resistant to precipitation by trichloroacetic acid. When (14)CO(2) fixation was occurring in cells that were not carrying on extensive synthesis of macromolecules, 38% of the (14)C was incorporated into cells and 59% occurred in the supernatant fluid. Sixty-nine per cent of the cellular (14)C was in protein, 21% was in low-molecular-weight compounds, and 9% was in nucleic acid. Addition of unlabeled aspartate to the medium inhibited incorporation of (14)CO(2). Based on studies of the rate of (14)CO(2) fixation, the cells fix CO(2) into a pool of intermediates which are either used for synthesis, primarily protein, or are excreted into the medium.

AB  - A virulent bacteriophage which causes a decrease in acid production during fermentation of a lactic acid beverage named Yakult with Lactobacillus casei was isolated from the abnormal fermentation tank and named PL-1. L. casei S strain was the exclusive host cell among 18 lactic acid bacteria tested. The plaque was round with an average diameter of about 0.5 mm. It exhibited serological cross-reaction with previously isolated J1 phage. Under an electron microscope, the phage had a spermatozoon shape, with an icosahedral head (63 nm) and a long tail (12.5 by 275 nm) with about 55 striae. The free phage particles were stable at pH 5 to 8. The phage was quite sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation or to heating (60 C, 5 min), and the host was more sensitive than the phage to these treatments. Many kinds of antimicrobial chemicals were also phagocidal. Calcium ion (5 mm) was specifically essential for the phage growth cycle. A one-step growth experiment under optimum conditions (37 C and pH 6.0) showed that the eclipse period was about 75 min, that the latent period was 100 min after the phage infection, and that the average burst size was about 200. The possibility of arresting phage development in lactic acid fermentation is discussed.

TI  - Induction of enterococcal L-forms by the action of lysozyme.
AB  - Suspensions of enterococci were treated with lysozyme in the presence of osmotic  stabilizers. The resulting osmotically fragile bodies prepared from Streptococcus faecium strain F24 and S. faecalis strain E1 gave rise to L-forms under optimal osmotic and nutritional conditions for treatment and subsequent growth. The most critical component of the growth medium, to obtain maximum yields, was the nature and concentration of the added salt. The two most effective salts were sodium chloride and ammonium chloride in the range of 2 to 3% (w/v) added to a suitable agar base. Ammonium chloride was more versatile, because it could be used with either sucrose or polyethylene glycol 4000 as the osmotic stabilizer for preparation and dilution of the osmotically fragile bodies. Sodium chloride would not consistently support growth of S. faecium F24 as L-forms when polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as the osmotic stabilizer during lysozyme treatment. Time-course studies of concurrent cell wall removal and L-form induction suggested that maximal induction required only cell wall damage rather than complete wall removal. This method for induction of L-forms from a suspension of enterococci is a significant improvement over other presently known methods.

Among 800 malt kernels, tested singly by the same procedure, 68% (540 kernels) were positive for fecal streptococci. In unsulfured and sulfured malts, 67 and 68% of the kernels, respectively, were positive for these bacteria. Fecal streptococci were also isolated by an enrichment procedure from two brands of instant malted milk powder sold in supermarkets. Seventy randomly picked isolates from malts were identified to be fecal streptococci, belonging probably to more than one species.
TI  - Site of initiation of cellular autolysis in Streptococcus faecalis as seen by electron microscopy.
AB  - Low concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.1% or higher) blocked cellular and wall autolysis. The site of autolytic activity was studied by allowing cell autolysis to proceed for very short periods (0 to 15 min) before addition of glutaraldehyde. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections showed that the primary site of autolytic activity was the leading edge of the nascent cross wall. The base of the cross wall seemed more resistant than the tip. Evidence supporting the involvement of autolysin activity in continued wall extension and in cell separation as well as in the initiation of new sites of wall extension was obtained. In cells exposed for 10 min to chloramphenicol, wall dissolution was very much slower but occurred at the same cross wall site.
TI  - Relationship between the location of autolysin, cell wall synthesis, and the development of resistance to cellular autolysis in Streptococcus faecalis after inhibition of protein synthesis.
AB  - Ten minutes after inhibition of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol (CAP) the  ability of cells of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) to autolyze decreased to less than 20% of the rate for exponential-phase cells. After threonine exhaustion, the time for a 50% drop in the rate of cellular autolysis was about 20 min. These rapid increases in resistance to cellular autolysis could not be accounted for by: (i) the relatively slow and small overall decrease in susceptibility of isolated cell walls to added autolysin, or (ii) a decreased content of either the active or latent (proteinase activatable) form of the autolysin in the wall fraction. Continued wall synthesis resulted in dilution of preexisting autolysin in the isolated wall fraction. The release of labeled "old" relative to "new" wall from CAP-treated cultures showed that wall synthesis shifted away from the areas of wall previously shown to be associated with wall synthesis (extension) in exponential-phase cells. A corresponding dispersal of active autolysin activity was not observed. By using actinomycin D and CAP, a requirement for ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis early in the recovery of cells from amino acid starvation was demonstrated for the recovery in the ability of cells to autolyze. Evidence was obtained which suggests that a protein is involved in the conversion of latent to active autolysin. During recovery from amino acid starvation, increase in wall synthesis and content of active autolysin was delayed (25 to 35 min), whereas an increase in turbidity and latent enzyme content began within 10 min. After treatment with CAP at 22 or 52 min of recovery, a further increase in levels of both active and latent autolysin was severely inhibited; however, the increase in rate of wall synthesis was indistinguishable from that of an untreated control. This suggests that an increase in rate of wall synthesis does not depend on an increase in level of active autolysin.

TI  - Early changes in the ultrastructure of Streptococcus faecalis after amino acid starvation.
AB  - Thin sections of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) starved of one essential amino acid (threonine or valine) initially show rapid increases in (i) cell wall thickness, (ii) the apparent size of the central nucleoid region, and (iii) mesosomal membranes. The most rapid increases in all three variables occurred during the first 1 to 2 hr of starvation. After this initial period, the rates progressively decreased over the 20-hr observation period. During threonine starvation, the mesosomal membrane that accumulated in the first hour was subsequently degraded and reached a level similar to that found in exponential-phase cells after 20 hr. With valine starvation, mesosomal membrane continued to slowly accumulate over the entire 20-hr observation period. The mesosomes of the starved cells retained the same "stalked-bag" morphology of those in exponential-phase cells. These cytological observations agree with previously published biochemical data on membrane lipid and wall content after starvation.

AB  - Comparisons of the starch-gel patterns of uninoculated aseptic control samples from rabbit and pig muscle with similar samples inoculated and incubated with Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella enteritidis, Achromobacter liquefaciens, and Kurthia zopfii were made. Results indicated that C. perfringens caused extensive alteration in the proteins or enzymes, or both, of the sarcoplasmic fraction of porcine muscle, whereas S. enteritidis and S. faecalis caused complete breakdown of only myoglobin. Neither A. liquefaciens nor K. zopfii showed any measurable amount of proteolysis in the sarcoplasmic fraction from pig muscle. Although some of the bands in the starch-gel pattern of rabbit muscle decreased in size and intensity of staining, complete proteolysis of any protein fraction was absent for all test organisms. The disc-gel patterns of the 8 m urea-soluble proteins showed that C. perfringens caused extensive proteolysis in pig muscle and a lesser extent of proteolysis in rabbit muscle. None of the other organisms utilized in this study had any measurable effect upon the urea-soluble proteins. In addition, a simple procedure for aseptic isolation of muscle samples for studying meat spoilage is outlined. Results indicate that careful sanitation and cleanliness will give suitable samples for meat spoilage investigations.

AB  - Extracts of cells of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens strain 31 incorporated (14)CO(2) into aspartate. Dialyzed extracts produced radioactive oxalacetate in the absence of exogenously added glutamate and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and produced radioactive aspartate in the presence of these components. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate could not be substituted for adenosine triphosphate (ATP); phosphoenolpyruvate even in the presence of nucleoside diphosphates could not replace pyruvate plus ATP; propionate plus coenzyme A (CoA) could not replace pyruvate in supporting CO(2) fixation by cell extracts. Fixation by dialyzed cell extracts required pyruvate, ATP, MgSO(4), and was stimulated by biotin, KCl, 2-mercaptoethanol, CoA, and acetyl CoA. Inhibition of fixation occurred when avidin, NaCl, oxalacetate, or aspartate was added to dialyzed extracts. On the basis of the products formed and the effects of substrates and cofactors on the fixation reaction, it was concluded that pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for CO(2) fixation in this microorganism.

TI  - In-vitro comparison of erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin, a new derivative of lincomycin, were compared. Clindamycin was always more active than lincomycin, and was either as active as erythromycin or more so against betahaemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus viridans, Str. pneumoniae, and erythromycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. It was also fully active against most erythromycin-resistant strains of Staph. aureus. On the other hand, it was somewhat less active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae and considerably less active than erythromycin against Str. faecalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Clinical trials seem to be justified in infections with sensitive organisms for which erythromycin might have been indicated.
TI  - Effect of pH of medium and size of inoculum on activity of antibiotics against group D Streptococcus (Enterococcus).
AB  - Seventy-one clinical isolates of 5 species of group D Streptococcus (Enterococcus) were tested for susceptibility to 15 antibiotics at pH 5.0, 7.4, and 8.5. Penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, and novobiocin were considerably more active against all strains at pH 5.0 than in the more alkaline media. On the other hand, lincomycin, clindimycin, erythromycin, and gentamicin were moderately to markedly more active at pH 8.5. No important differences were noted in the susceptibility of the strains to kanamycin and streptomycin, at the pH levels tested, but the organisms were quite resistant to them in these tests. The various species differed quantitatively in their susceptibility to the individual drugs and in the effects of pH. The size of the inoculum also had a variable effect on susceptibility, depending on the species of Enterococcus, the antibiotics, and the pH of the test medium. The data suggest that, in the antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Enterococcus, attempts should be made to achieve the optimum pH in the urine, particularly in view of the fact that organisms of this group are often resistant to several antibiotics in the usual tests.

AB  - An l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase was purified approximately 35-fold from crude extracts of Streptococcus faecalis. The purified enzyme had an absolute and specific requirement for fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) for catalytic activity. The concentration of FDP required for 50% maximal activity was about 0.045 mm. The activator was bound to the enzyme more effectively at pH 5.8 than it was at a neutral or alkaline pH. Activation appeared to involve a conformational change in the enzyme which made the substrate and coenzyme sites more accessible to the respective reactants. Among the evidence supporting this hypothesis was the fact that FDP lowered significantly the apparent K(m) for both pyruvate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Moreover, the enzyme, which was quite heat stable in the absence of any of the reactants, was rendered heat labile by FDP.

TI  - Model for cell wall growth of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - In exponentially growing and dividing cells of Streptococcus faecalis, it is proposed that the leading edge of the annularly closing cross wall is the point of extension for both cross wall and peripheral wall. Peripheral wall extension is thought to be produced by the separation or splitting of the cross wall at its junction with peripheral wall. This results in the pushing of the equatorial wall bands, found on S. faecalis walls, to subsequatorial positions. These bands therefore mark the separation of old wall from new wall. Mesosomal formation was observed usually to precede cross wall initiation.

AB  - Glycolyzing cells of Streptococcus faecalis accumulate K(+) with concurrent extrusion of equivalent amounts of H(+) and Na(+). An attempt was made to clarify the retionship between the movements of Na(+) and K(+). Sodium was displaced from cells glycolyzing in the presence of ammonia, diethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and other nitrogenous cations; by contrast, K(+) was completely retained. Accumulation of K(+) by heterologous exchange for Na(+) was not inhibited by antibiotics which facilitate diffusion of K(+) across the membrane, but was blocked by proton conductors. The results indicate that extrusion of Na(+) and H(+) from the cells is a primary, energy-linked process which generates an electrical potential (interior negative); K(+) accumulation occurs in response to this potential. Two mutants deficient in K(+) accumulation and retention were examined in terms of this model. One mutant is apparently defective in exchange of K(+) for H(+). In the other mutant, exchange of K(+) for Na(+) is impaired.

AB  - If a cell-free extract of Streptococcus faecalis is fractionated by way of a 10 to 70% sucrose gradient, at least three areas are found capable of protein synthesis having a density greater than can be accounted for by association of individual ribosomes. These areas represent distinct "polysome" peaks rather than random distribution of polymers of varied length. They appear to be membrane subunits. In addition there is a further particle with a density of about 150S, incapable of protein synthesis but which is capable of stimulating protein synthesis in some of the larger fractions found by gradient centrifugation.

TI  - Biochemical changes in serum of pure and mixed Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis infections in rats.
AB  - Rats inoculated with Streptococcus faecalis developed endocarditis and demonstrated a 6- to 30-fold increase in aldolase, isocitric dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, and lactic dehydrogenase. The animals infected with Bacillus subtilis did not develop overt disease nor significant increases in enzyme activities, but viable organisms were recovered at 2 weeks. Rats inoculated with mixed culture of these organisms showed a 2- to 10-fold increase of enzyme activities without evidence of pathological anatomic changes. Both organisms were recovered at necropsy. The total protein and glycoproteins followed the patterns of enzyme activities. There were major changes in alpha(1), alpha(2), and beta globulins and glycoglobuulins at the early stages of infection. The protein-bound hexose changes coincided with the severity of S. faecalis infection, but were at normal levels after 72 hr of infection of B. subtilis and S. faecalis mixed infections. The results indicate that B. subtilis infection modified the pathogenicity of S. faecalis and by an unknown mechanism affected protein and glycoprotein production in serum of experimental rats.

TI  - Relationship between the latent form and the active form of the autolytic enzyme  of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A 10-hr starvation of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 for the amino acids methionine and threonine results in cells which are resistant to autolysis and which contain greatly reduced quantities of both active and latent (proteinase activable) forms of the autolytic enzyme (an N-acetyl-muramide glycanhydrolase). Cell walls were isolated from cells harvested at various times during the recovery from such starvation and were assayed for active and latent forms of the autolysin. Within 10 min of recovery the latent enzyme began to increase. Only after 30 to 60 min did the active enzyme begin to increase; after a similar lag, the cells' proneness to lysis markedly increased. The intracellular localization of both forms of the autolysin was examined, using as an experimental tool the ability of added cell wall to bind autolysin. (14)C-lysine-labeled, inactivated cell walls were added to exponential-phase cells, which were then disrupted, and the mixed wall population was isolated. Measurement of the (14)C release during wall autolysis indicated that the active enzyme in the cells was not available for binding to the added (14)C-labeled walls and was therefore wall-bound in vivo. In contrast, up to 85% of latent autolysin activity was found to have been efficiently bound to the added (14)C walls. The results obtained suggest (i) cellular autolysis is a reflection of the level of active enzyme and not of latent enzyme, and (ii) autolysin is synthesized and mainly located in the cytoplasm as an inactive latent precursor (proenzyme) which is transported to sites on the cell wall associated with wall biosynthesis, where it becomes activated.

TI  - Interaction of a bacterial adenosine triphosphatase with phospholipid bilayers.
AB  - A solubilized nonparticulate adenosine triphosphatase from Streptococcus fecalis  spheroplast membranes (Abrams, A., and C. Baron, Biochemistry, 7,501 (1968)) interacts at pH 7.5 with lipid bilayer membranes to produce a 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold increase in the electric conductance of the bilayer. In addition, a small decrease in the electrical capacitance of the interactant system is also observed. Interaction is obtained with bilayers formed from a solution in n-decane of either purified egg phosphatidyl-choline, synthetic diphytanoyl phosphatidyl-choline, or a total extract of the membrane lipid of S. fecalis. The magnitude of the increase in conductance is dependent on the presence of Mg(++) and upon the concentrations of both Na(+) and K(+) in the range of 10(-2) to 10(-1)M. An additional tenfold increase in conductance is obtained when ATP is added to the ambient aqueous phase surrounding the bilayer ATPase interactant system. No conductance change is obtained with ATPase which has been treated with pronase. ATPase activity is dependent upon Mg(++) and upon the concentrations of Na(+) and K(+) in the region of 10(-1)M. The function of the ATPase in the intact bacterial membrane is apparently associated with the active transport of cations. The increased conductance in the bilayer which results from its interaction with the ATPase, together with the similarity between the dependence of this interaction and the dependence of ATPase activity on Mg(++), ATP, and the Na(+), K(+) concentrations suggests that the bilayer-ATPase interactant complex may be similar in structure and properties to the membrane-ATPase complex in the intact organism.

Bacterial colonization of the jejunum defined, in this context, as the occurrence of a bile salttolerant flora consisting of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria qualitatively resembling that of faeces, was observed only in patients with some form of blind loop. Prominent among the bacteria isolated from these colonized juices were non-sporing anaerobic bacteria, most usually Bacteroides, able to hydrolyse bile salts. No simple correlation between the patient's fat excretion and bacterial colonization of the jejunum could be demonstrated.

AB  - Survivorship of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in dibiotic and tribiotic interactions in vitro and in various regions of the digestive tract of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina. In dibiotic interactions, Salmonella typhimurium dominated Streptococcus faecalis and was dominated by P. mirabilis, but in neither case was it eliminated from the larval gut. In tribiotic interactions, there was synergic suppression and a definite trend toward elimination of Salmonella typhimurium from the gut. This trend approaches but does not match the total exclusion of S. typhimurium from the gut of maggots with a normal flora. Bacterial survival in the gut of the fly is discussed in relation to doubling time, sweep-out rate of the maggot and prepupal gut, and the midgut bactericide.

AB  - Exploration of the specific role of cystine in the postexponential growth of Streptococcus faecalis led to an inquiry into the fate of cellular coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein (ACP), both of which depend for their biosynthesis on cystine and pantothenate as precursors. In S. faecalis cells labeled by growth in the presence of (14)C-pantothenate, the label could be separated on the basis of solubility at pH 2.1 into two fractions of sharply differing metabolic characteristics. The fractions were not purified, but the soluble (14)C behaved analytically like CoA, and the insoluble (14)C was considered to represent an ACP-like entity on the basis of circumstantial evidence. The fate of these two fractions under various conditions of growth was studied. When the medium contained an excess of the needed precursors, the cellular content of CoA and ACP appeared to remain constant during exponential growth, and in a molar ratio of about 4 CoA to 1 ACP. Cellular ACP, once formed, appeared to be stable under these conditions, but CoA was degraded and replaced at the rate of approximately 20% per division period. With restrictive levels of pantothenate in the medium, initially formed CoA disappeared during growth, as a result, apparently of being converted to ACP. However, when the resulting CoA-depleted cells were returned to a medium containing enough pantothenate, resumption of normal growth was preceded by a lag period, during which rapid conversion of ACP to CoA appeared to take place.
TI  - Autolytic enzyme system of Streptococcus faecalis. V. Nature of the autolysin-cell wall complex and its relationship to properties of the autolytic enzyme of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Cell walls from exponential-phase cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 contain an autolysin (a beta-N-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase, E.C. 3.2.1.17) which has been isolated from trypsin-speeded wall autolysates. The autolysin, which was excluded from Bio-Gel P-60, was further fractionated by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography or filtration on Bio-Gel P-200. After DEAE-cellulose chromatography, which removed most of the wall polysaccharide, autolysin activity was extremely labile and was rapidly lost at -20 C, even in the presence of albumin. The P-60-excluded enzyme was rapidly bound by walls at both 37 C (50% bound in about 1 min) and 0 C (50% bound in less than 4 min). Wall-bound autolysin could not be removed by 1.0 m ammonium acetate (pH 6.9). Autolysin was also bound by walls that had been extracted with 10% trichloroacetic acid or treated with 0.01 n periodate, suggesting that the nonpeptidoglycan wall polymers are not important for binding. Wall-bound autolysin was more stable than the soluble enzyme to proteinase digestion, acetone (40%), 8 m urea (at 0 C), or to inactivation at 56 C. Two bacterial neutral proteinases (which do not hydrolyze ester bonds) activated latent wall-bound autolysin, suggesting that activation results from the cleavage of one or more peptide bonds. The group A streptococcal proteinase activated latent autolysin but differed from the other proteinases in that it did not inactivate soluble autolysin. The results suggest that the autolysin is not covalently linked to the wall. The high affinity of the walls for the autolysin appears to be responsible for the firm, not easily reversed binding.
TI  - A study of folate absorption and metabolism in man utilizing carbon-14--labeled polyglutamates synthesized by the solid phase method.
AB  - The absorption and metabolism of synthetic polyglutamates of folic acid have been compared with free pteroylglutamic acid in four subjects having chronic lymphatic leukemia and one with Hodgkin's granuloma. Pteroylpolyglutamates containing either three or seven glutamate residues were prepared by the solid-phase method permitting placement of carbon-14 labels in either the pteridine ring or in a selected glutamate unit of the gamma peptide chain. Complete dissociation was observed between biological folate activity and radioactivity of plasma after ingestion of pteroyltriglutamate labeled in the middle glutamate. This indicates cleavage to the monoglutamate form at the time of absorption from the intestine or very soon thereafter. A large portion of radioactivity liberated from the middle glutamate is recoverable as carbon dioxide in the exhaled air. Fecal losses of folate tended to be greater with increasing length of the poly-gamma-glutamyl chain. Higher blood levels and greater urinary losses of folate tended to occur after ingestion of mono- and triglutamates than with the heptaglutamate. Calculations based on radioactivity determinations in feces plus urinary folate losses, judged by either radioactivity or microbiological assays, indicated net retention of 37-67% of the dose irrespective of chain length ingested and major avenue of loss. During the peak of absorption the folate circulating in plasma was active for both Streptococcus fecalis and Lactobacillus casei and carried specific radioactivity which was virtually identical with that of the administered dose. This suggests that neither methylation, conjugation, nor displacement of nonradioactive folate occurred to any significant extent during the 1st 2 hr. The specific radioactivity of 24-hr urine specimens as measured with L. casei corresponded closely with that of the administered dose. Evidence exists that methylation of the radioactive folate may occur, but significant displacement of nonradioactive methylfolate was not observed under the conditions of this study. Since 50-75% of administered heptaglutamate appears to be absorbable in man, estimates of dietary intake should include this fraction as well as the "free" folate.
TI  - Antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  - A series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. Although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In other comparative laboratory tests against P. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. An examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. The compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. Results of studies with a cell-free P. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for P. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. Some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  - Malate utilization by a group D Streptococcus: physiological properties and purification of an inducible malic enzyme.

Synthesis of the malic enzyme did not appear to be subject to catabolite repression by intermediate products of glucose or fructose dissimilation. However, malate utilization was inhibited during growth in the presence of glucose or fructose. The purified enzyme was specific for malate as substrate and NAD as cofactor. Mn(+2) or Mg(+2) was required for optimal activity and NH(4)Cl stimulated the reaction rate. Several lines of indirect evidence suggested that the streptococcal malic enzyme was involved primarily with energy production and not biosynthesis.

AB  - Modifications of a commercial 2,450-megahertz microwave oven were made so that 6  ml of microbial suspension could be exposed to the microwave field for various periods of time. The microorganisms were contained in the central tube of a modified Liebig condenser positioned in the approximate geometric center of the oven cavity. Kerosene at -25 C was circulated through the jacket of the condenser during microwave exposure permitting microwaves to reach the microbial suspension. Flow rates of the kerosene were varied to permit the temperature of the suspension to range from 25 to 55 C during microwave exposure. Conductive heating experiments using similar temperatures were also conducted. A thermocouple-relay system was employed to measure the suspension temperature immediately after the magnetron shutoff. Continuous application of microwaves to suspensions of 10(8) to 10(9)Streptococcus faecalis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae per ml appeared to produce no lethal effects other than those produced by heat. Respiration rates of microwave-exposed Scerevisiae were directly related to decreases in viable count produced by increased microwave exposure times.
TI  - Dependence of protease secretion by Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens on arginine and its possible relation to site of synthesis.
AB  - Washed cells of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens, when harvested from media that supported protease biosynthesis, continued to release this extracellular enzyme in phosphate buffer. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) halted the secretion. If zinc ions were added to the EDTA-treated cells before 45 to 60 min had elapsed, a fraction of the anticipated enzyme activity was observed. After 60 min, arginine and phosphate, in addition to zinc, were necessary for the demonstration of proteolytic activity. The enzyme that was released was newly formed, because chloramphenicol, puromycin, or actinomycin D prevented its appearance. Energy for this synthetic reaction was obtained, apparently, from arginine; lactose could not be substituted for arginine. This last point is interpreted to mean that extracellular protease biosynthesis occurs in a localized area or cellular compartment into which the adenosine triphosphate derived from the fermentation of lactose cannot diffuse. No evidence was found for a protease zymogen, although this possibility is not completely precluded.
TI  - Role of pyruvate metabolism in the growth of Streptococcus faecalis in the presence of propionate.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus faecalis is inhibited by propionate, and the inhibition is reversed by lipoic acid or acetate. A study of the role of pyruvate oxidation in S. faecalis showed that propionate inhibited the lipoic acid-dependent aerobic oxidation of pyruvate in resting cells. Pyruvate dehydrogenation with neotetrazolium as a hydrogen acceptor in cell-free extracts also required lipoic acid and was markedly inhibited by propionyl phosphate as well as sodium propionate. Some lipid substances, such as palmitate, oleate, behenate, and lecithin, had a lipoic acid-replacing effect on growth of the organism. Biotin or bicarbonate promoted the lipoic acid-dependent growth. Acetate-2-(14)C added to the medium was mainly incorporated into the lipid fraction of the cells. Evolution of (14)CO(2) from pyruvate-2-(14)C was not observed in resting cells of the organism, even under aerobic conditions. From the above findings, it is concluded that lipid synthesis through pyruvate oxidation plays a very important role in bacterial growth in medium containing propionate.

TI  - Bacteriocin (hemolysin) of Streptococcus zymogenes.
AB  - The sensitivity of Streptococcus faecalis (ATTC 8043) to S. zymogenes X-14 bacteriocin depends greatly on its physiological age. Sensitivity decreases from the mid-log phase on and is completely lost in the stationary phase. The sensitivity of erythrocytes to the hemolytic capacity of the bacteriocin showed considerable species variation. The order of increasing sensitivity was goose < sheep < dog < horse < human < rabbit. However, when red cell stromata were used as inhibitors of hemolysis in a standard system employing rabbit erythrocytes the order of increasing effectiveness was sheep < rabbit < human < horse < goose. When rabbit cells were used in varying concentrations with a constant hemolysin concentration, there was a lag of about 30 min, which for a given hemolysin preparation was constant for all red cell concentrations. Furthermore, the rate of hemolysis increased with increasing red cell concentration. If red cells are held constant and lysin varied, the time to reach half-maximal lysis varies directly with lysin but is not strictly proportional. Bacterial membranes were one to three orders of magnitude more effective than red cell stromata as inhibitors. The order of increasing effectiveness seems to be Escherichia coli < Bacillus megaterium < S. faecalis < Micrococcus lysodeikticus. In addition to membranes, a d-alanine containing glycerol teichoic acid, trypsin in high concentration, and deoxyribonuclease also inhibited hemolysis. Ribonuclease, d-alanine, l-alanine, dl-alanyl-dl-alanine, N-acetyl-d-alanine, N-acetyl-l-alanine did not inhibit hemolysis.

TI  - Inhibition of membrane transport in Streptococcus faecalis by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and its relationship to proton conduction.
AB  - We studied the effect of compounds that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation on membrane function in Streptoccocus faecalis, an organism which relies upon glycolysis for the generation of metabolic energy. At low concentrations (ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-4)m), tetrachlorosalicylanilide, tetramethyldipicrylamine, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, pentachlorophenol, and dicoumarol strongly inhibited energy-dependent transport of rubidium, phosphate, and certain amino acids. However, these compounds had little effect on the generation of adenosine triphosphate via glycolysis or on its utilization for the synthesis of macromolecules. They also did not seriously inhibit uptake of those monosaccharides and amino acids which do not require concurrent metabolism. It is proposed that the uncouplers interfere with the utilization of metabolic energy for membrane transport. The uncouplers accelerated the translocation of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. It appears that a proton-impermeable membrane is required for transport, perhaps, because a proton gradient is involved in the coupling of metabolic energy to the translocation of substrates across the membrane.

TI  - Autolytic enzyme system of Streptococcus faecalis. IV. Electron microscopic observations of autolysin and lysozyme action.
AB  - Cell walls (LOG walls) were isolated from cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 in the exponential phase of growth. These walls were either allowed to undergo autolytic dissolution (in the presence or absence of trypsin) or wall autolysis was inactivated with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS walls). Inactivated walls were treated either with lysozyme or with isolated, partially purified S. faecalis autolysin. During wall lysis, samples were removed, negatively stained with phosphotungstate, and examined in the electron microscope. Both lysozyme and isolated autolysin appeared to act over the entire surface of SDS walls. After partial dissolution, a fibrous network over the surface was revealed. Lysozyme digestion revealed the presence of prominent, highly-contrasted equatorial and subequatorial bands around the walls. After trichloroacetic acid extraction, the bands were seen less frequently and less distinctly in the partially lysozyme digested walls, suggesting that the bands contained nonpeptidoglycan polymers. In the absence of trypsin (which activates a latent form of the autolysin), autolysis of LOG walls appeared to start at the equatorial bands and to proceed back towards the apex of the coccus. Ribbons of wall material coming off the wide edge of the nearly hemispherical wall fragments were observed. Activation of latent autolysis resulted in lytic action over the entire wall surface. The results are consistent with the previously postulated location of active autolysin at the areas of new wall synthesis and the random location of latent autolysin in LOG walls.
TI  - Thermal injury and recovery of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Exposure of Streptococcus faecalis R57 to sublethal heating produced a temporary  change in the salt tolerance and growth of the organism. After sublethal heat treatment at 60 C for 15 min, greater than 99.0% of the viable population was unable to reproduce on media containing 6% NaCl. In addition, the heated cells displayed a sensitivity to incubation temperature, pH, and 0.01% methylene blue. When the injured cells were placed in a synthetic medium, recovery occurred at a much slower rate than in a complex medium. However, both media supported comparable growth of the uninjured organism. Various media used for the enrichment of streptococci also provided a suitable environment for the recovery of the injured cells. Generally, as more selective agents were present in the medium, the rates of recovery decreased. Metabolic inhibitor studies with chloramphenicol, penicillin, and actinomycin D substantiated the fact that the process involved was recovery and not growth, and that this recovery was linked to ribonucleic acid synthesis.
TI  - Growth of Streptococcus faecalis under high hydrostatic pressure and high partial pressures of inert gases.
AB  - Growth of Streptococcus faecalis in a complex medium was inhibited by xenon, nitrous oxide, argon, and nitrogen at gas pressures of 41 atm or less. The order of inhibitory potency was: xenon and nitrous oxide > argon > nitrogen. Helium appeared to be impotent. Oxygen also inhibited streptococcal growth and it acted synergistically with narcotic gases. Growth was slowed somewhat by 41 atm hydrostatic pressure in the absence of narcotic gases, but the gas effects were greater than those due to pressure. In relation to the sensitivity of this bacterium to pressure, we found that the volume of cultures increased during growth in a volumeter or dilatometer, and that this dilatation was due mainly to glycolysis. A volume increase of 20.3 +/- 3.6 ml/mole of lactic acid produced was measured, and this value was close to one of 24 ml/mole lactic acid given for muscle glycolysis, and interestingly, close to the theoretic volume increase of activation calculated from the depression of growth rate by pressure.
TI  - Molar growth yields as evidence for oxidative phosphorylation in Streptococcus faecalis strain 10Cl.
AB  - During the aerobic growth of Streptococcus faecalis strain 10C1, with limiting levels of glucose as the substrate, a molar growth yield (Y) of 58.2 g (dry weight) per mole of glucose was obtained. Under these conditions of growth, glucose was dissimilated primarily to acetate and CO(2). The incorporation of (14)C-glucose into cell material was no greater under aerobic conditions than during anaerobic growth. Assuming an adenosine triphosphate coefficient of 10.5, the aerobic Y cannot be explained solely on the basis of substrate phosphorylation and would appear to substantiate previous enzymatic evidence for oxidative phosphorylation in this cytochromeless species. With mannitol as the substrate, an aerobic Y of 64.6 was obtained. Extracts of mannitol-grown cells contained a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-linked mannitol-1-phosphate (M-1-P) dehydrogenase. The difference in aerobic Y values with mannitol and glucose as substrates would indicate that the in vivo P/O ratio from the oxidation of reduced NAD generated by the oxidation of M-1-P approximates 0.6. The Y values with pyruvate and glycerol as substrates under aerobic conditions were 15.5 and 24.7, respectively.
TI  - Modified biochemical tests for characterization of L-phase variants of bacteria.
AB  - Biochemical capabilities of bacterial and L-phase organisms of 15 bacterial strains were examined by using a variety of modified routine diagnostic biochemical tests. The results demonstrated that 13 of the tests examined were suitable for use with L-phase variants, that L-phase variants and revertant bacterial phase organisms retained diagnostically significant capabilities of the respective bacterial or L-phase organisms from which they were derived, and that the 13 biochemical tests could be usefully employed to relate a given L-phase variant to a given bacterial phase organism, to distinguish L-phase variants of different species, and to aid in the identification of nonreverting L-phase variants.

TI  - Transport of aminophosphonic acids in Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Aminophosphonic acids analogous to glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and valine were actively accumulated by Lactobacillus plantarum. Uptake was dependent on the availability of glucose and, in all cases, the estimated intracellular concentrations substantially exceeded extracellular levels. During uptake, there was little metabolism of tritiated 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (APP), the aspartic acid analogue, and a negligible incorporation of isotope from this substance into the nucleic acid, lipid, protein, or cell wall fractions of the cell. Competition studies with APP indicated that its transport in L. plantarum and in Streptococcus faecalis was antagonized only by structurally related compounds such as glutamic, aspartic, and cysteic acids. Kinetic studies showed that APP was taken up by a single catalytic system in S. faecalis. A mutant strain of this organism which lacks one of two kinetically distinguishable dicarboxylic amino acid transport systems failed to accumulate measurable amounts of APP. These experiments indicate that the aminophosphonic acids are accumulated by the amino acid transport systems in these bacteria with minimal metabolic changes.
TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
TI  - Site in cell-free protein synthesis sensitive to diphtheria toxin.
AB  - The effects of diphtheria toxin on cell-free protein synthesis in a bacterial system, and preparations obtained from animals that were sensitive and resistant to toxin were examined. In the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), toxin inhibited the incorporation of amino acids by endogenous and synthetic polynucleotides in both rat liver and guinea pig liver cell-free systems that were exposed to 6 Lf units per ml of toxin. A cell-free system derived from Streptococcus faecalis was resistant to high concentrations of toxin. Dialyzed toxin-antitoxin floccules that are formed in the presence of NAD and the 105,000 x g supernatant fluid from rat liver contain NAD. Such floccules are also active in protein synthesis in the absence of added transferase I or II. An operational model presents the view that the intoxication complex is formed at the ribosomal level and occurs in two steps. First, the toxin molecule binds to transferase II and alters its stereospecific relationship to transferase I, but it does not result in an inactive complex. Second, the stereospecific alteration in transferase I, but it does not result in an inactive complex. Second, the stereospecific alteration in transferase II caused by the binding of diphtheria toxin allows NAD to bridge between transferase I and II, which then results in an inactivated complex. The sensitivity of the cell-free system derived from the normally resistant rat implies that in some cells the cell membrane serves as a permeability barrier to the toxin molecule. The resistance of bacterial cell-free protein synthesizing systems to diphtheria toxin may reflect basic differences between transferase enzymes from bacterial and mammalian sources.
TI  - Activities of arginine dihydrolase and phosphatase in Streptococcus faecalis and  Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium are known to produce ammonia from arginine, but only S. faecalis couples the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced through the arginine dihydrolase pathway to growth processes. The specific activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes were found to be much lower in S. faecium (0.01 to 0.10) than in S. faecalis (0.24 to 1.60). Phosphatase activities in both strains were similar (up to 0.11), but equaled or exceeded the activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes in S. faecium. The failure of S. faecium to show increased growth in arginine media is explained on the basis of low activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes coupled with sufficient phosphatase activity to negate any benefit from ATP formed.

AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

Lysis of bacterial protoplasts by preparations of alpha-toxin appeared to be due to contamination of the preparations with delta-lysin. Data comparing the protoplast-lysing activity of various lytic agents are presented.

AB  - Molar growth yields determined from batch cultures of Streptococcus diacetilactis and S. faecalis were appreciably greater at the peaks of maximal growth than after continued incubation and considerable autolysis. The higher molar growth yields were about equal to those determined in a continuous culture. Autolysis during logarithmic growth was minimal. The average Y value for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), determined by using limiting concentrations of glucose, galactose, lactose, and maltose for growing S. diacetilactis and limiting concentrations of glucose for growing S. lactis, S. cremoris, and S. faecalis, was 17.0. This is close to the Y (arginine) value of 17.8 determined with S. faecalis, but 62% greater than the generally accepted value of 10.5. Data are presented indicating that the often-used Y (ATP) value of 10.5 is erroneously low.

AB  - In an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in Mueller-Hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. Studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of different antibiotics were investigated. With 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. Therefore, despite minor variations when the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that Mueller-Hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. A simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by the more arduous plate dilution test.
TI  - Effect of salt concentration in the recovery medium on heat-injured Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Properties relating to the recovery of three heat-injured strains of Streptococcus faecalis were studied. All strains were cultured in all purpose plus Tween broth (APT) at 30 C for 24 hr before being subjected to heat in fresh APT broth. APT recovery medium containing various added amounts of NaCl, KCl, MgCl(2), or KCl and MgCl(2) was used to assess the effect of salts on the recovery of thermally injured S. faecalis. It was evident that, upon exposure to heat, S. faecalis cells became sensitive to increased salt concentrations. Analyses to determine the ribonucleic acid (RNA) content of heated cells showed a reduction of cellular RNA, but the per cent reduction was not directly proportional to the per cent reduction of the viable cells.

TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

AB  - Streptococcus faecalis, incubated in osmotically stabiliz medium in the presence  of 1000 units of penicillin per milliliter, accumulated rather than extruded sodium; they accumulated much less potassium than control cells did. These changes were not due to binding of sodium by cell-wall fragments of cells treated with penicillin. Because penicillin had no effect on cation concentrations in stable protoplasts and nongrowing bacterial cells, this effect appeared to be related to the production of the penicillin-induced lesions of the cell wall.

TI  - Effect of hydroxylysine on the biosynthesis of lysine in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We were able to show that two lysine-independent mutants of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 contained the enzymes for the usual bacterial pathway for lysine biosynthesis. Because of this synthetic capacity, one mutant, the Lys(+)OHLys(s) strain, could not grow in the presence of hydroxylysine without a lysine supplement. Both lysine and hydroxylysine inhibited the first enzyme of the pathway, aspartokinase. Unlike the Escherichia coli enzyme, S. faecalis dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase was not inhibited by either lysine or hydroxylysine. Both amino acids caused the repression of dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase and diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase. Failure of Lys(+)OHLys(s) strain to grow in hydroxylysine-supplemented medium was caused by the mimicking of lysine control by hydroxylysine. Because hydroxylysine could not completely substitute for lysine and lysine could not be synthesized, the organism did not grow. We tested three lysine analogues and found that they prevented lysine-depletion lysis in the Lsy(-)OHLys(s) strain, as did hydroxylysine. Each analogue seemed to support cell wall mucopeptide synthesis, although ornithine did not. Preliminary data indicated that these analogues like hydroxylysine, have growth-inhibitory action on the Lys(+)OHLys(s) strain, but not the Lys(+)OHLys(r) strain. The nature of the specificity of the lysine-adding enzyme for cell wall mucopeptide synthesis is discussed.
TI  - Effects of nigericin and monactin on cation permeability of Streptococcus faecalis and metabolic capacities of potassium-depleted cells.
AB  - At a concentration of 10(-6)m, nigericin and monactin inhibited growth of Streptococcus faecalis, and the inhibition was reversed by addition of excess K(+). In the presence of certain antibiotics, the cells exhibited increased permeability to certain cations; internal Rb(+) was rapidly lost by exchange with external H(+), K(+) Rb(+), and, more slowly, with Na(+) and Li(+). No effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. Cation exchanges induced by nigericin and monactin were metabolically passive and apparently did not involve the energy-dependent K(+) pump. When the cells were washed, the cytoplasmic membrane recovered its original impermeability to cations. By use of monactin, we prepared cells whose K(+) content had been completely replaced by other cations, and the metabolic characteristics of K(+)-depleted cells were studied. Cells containing only Na(+) glycolyzed almost as well as did normal ones and, under proper conditions, could accumulate amino acids and orthophosphate. These cells also incorporated (14)C-uracil into ribonucleic acid but incorporation of (14)C-leucine into protein was strictly dependent upon the addition of K(+). When K(+) or Rb(+) was added to sodium-loaded cells undergoing glycolysis, these ions were accumulated by stoichiometric exchange for Na(+). From concurrent measurements of the rate of glycolysis, it was calculated that one mole-pair of cations was exchanged for each mole of adenosine triphosphate produced.

TI  - Effect of algicidal quaternaries on the germicidal activity of chlorine on swimming pool water.
AB  - The Swimming Pool Water Disinfectant Test Method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists was used to determine the effect of the accepted level of 2 ppm of some commercial quaternary ammonium algicides on the germicidal activity of chlorine. Accurate determinations on the amounts of residual available chlorine in chlorine-quaternary mixtures could not be made by the usual chemical methods. This made it necessary to base all comparisons on the starting concentrations of available chlorine rather than the final concentration as specified in the method employed. No evidence was obtained to support the use of lower concentrations of residual available chlorine for disinfection in the presence of algicidal quaternaries than those commonly recognized as effective by the American Public Health Association. The rate of kill against the gram-positive test organism Streptococcus faecalis was faster in quaternary-chlorine mixtures than in the sodium hypochlorite control solutions. The practical significance of this result in the bench method identified cannot be ascertained in the absence of more sensitive and precise chemical procedures for determining concentrations of residual available chlorine in the presence of quaternaries or in actual swimming pool tests.

TI  - Autolytic enzyme system of Streptococcus faecalis. 3. Localization of the autolysin at the sites of cell wall synthesis.
AB  - Cell walls from exponential-phase cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 autolyzed in dilute buffers. Walls were isolated from cultures grown in the presence of (14)C-lysine for about 10 generations and then on (12)C-lysine for 0.1 to 0.8 of a generation (prelabeled). These walls released (14)C to the soluble fraction more slowly than they lost turbidity during the initial stages of autolysis. Walls isolated from cultures grown in the presence of (14)C-lysine for only the last 0.1 to 0.4 of a generation (postlabeled) released (14)C to the supernatant fluid more rapidly than they lost turbidity. Autolysin in both pre- and postlabeled walls was inactivated, and such walls were then incubated in the presence of unlabeled walls containing active autolysin. The inactivated walls lost their (14)C label only very slowly until autolysis of the unlabeled walls was virtually complete and release of soluble autolysin was expected. When this experiment was done in the presence of trypsin, a fourfold increase in the autolysis rate resulted, but the same pattern of (14)C release was observed. A parallel release of (14)C and loss of turbidity from pre- or postlabeled walls was observed upon trypsin "activation" and by addition of isolated soluble autolysin to inactivated walls. We conclude that the wall-bound autolysin acts first on the more recently synthesized portion of the wall. Trypsin appears to speed wall autolysis by activating additional latent autolysin in situ at sites in the older portion of the wall.
TI  - Energies of activation and uncoupled growth in Streptococcus faecalis and Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Growing cultures of Streptococcus faecalis at temperatures above 30 C have activation energies for both rates of growth and glycolysis of 10.3 kcal mole(-1), and a constant growth yield; when growth takes place below this temperature, the growth yield decreases and the activation energy for growth increases to 21.1 kcal mole(-1), but the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged. The adenosine triphosphate pool in the organisms behaves differently above and below 30 C, suggesting that the energetic coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective below 30 C. Washed suspensions of S. faecalis have repressed glycolytic activity and an activation energy for glycolysis of 15.6 kcal mole(-1) over the whole temperature range studied. Growing cultures of Zymomonas mobilis below 33 C have a constant growth yield of 8.3 g (dry weight) of organisms per mole of glucose degraded, and activation energies for both glycolysis and growth of 11.1 kcal mole(-1); above this temperature, the growth yield falls, the activation energy for growth changes to -6.9 kcal mole(-1), but the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged, so that the coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective above 33 C. The findings support the view that energy turnover in these bacteria is not well regulated.
TI  - Role of the phagocyte in host-parasite interactions. XII. Hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase bactericidal system in the phagocyte.
AB  - An antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. This system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. A lysed-granules (LG) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative PMN. LG alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the pH of the reaction; the lower the pH, the more marked the activity. When low concentrations of both H(2)O(2) and LG were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. This enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. The LG-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a pH range of 4.0 to 6.0. The activity of the LG-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, NaN(3), KCN, and aminotriazole. The antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

This treatment was effective in destroying Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus subtilis, and bacteriophage specific for S. cremoris ML1. The presence of added protein in bacterial suspensions resulted in reduced bactericidal action. Water subjected to electrohydraulic treatment retained a certain amount of toxicity when copper-core electrodes were used to apply the treatment. This was caused by copper liberated from the electrode during electrohydraulic discharge.

AB  - The vitamin requirements of the group Q streptococci (Streptococcus avium) and the established enterococcal species (S. faecalis and S. faecium) paralleled one another, although S. avium did not characteristically require riboflavine or pyridoxal. S. avium was further differentiated in that it required thymine for growth initiation whether or not folate was present. Folate was stimulatory in the presence of sub-optimal concentrations of thymine, as well as during the early growth period with optimal thymine concentrations. Folinate completely replaced the thymine requirement, and the S. avium strains required significantly higher concentrations than did Pediococcus cerevisiae 8081. The requirement pattern for folate and related compounds was compared, and marked differences were observed in the requirements of S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, and P. cerevisiae.
TI  - Group Q streptococci. I. Ecology, serology, physiology, and relationship to established enterococci.
AB  - The group Q streptococci possess unique serological and physiological characteristics which differentiate them from established enterococci. The group Q antigen was not demonstrable in all strains; however, all possessed the group D antigen. All group Q strains were physiologically similar regardless of whether or not they possessed the group Q antigen. These strains differed from the established enterococcal species, as they neither hydrolyzed arginine nor initiated growth in 1.0% methylene blue-milk. They also differed radically in the fermentation of various carbohydrates, especially the polyhydric sugar alcohols. The results indicate that the group Q streptococci constitute a unique taxonomic entity; the species designation Streptococcus avium sp. n. is suggested, owing to their characteristic occurrence in chicken fecal specimens.

TI  - Gramicidin, valinomycin, and cation permeability of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Gramicidin and valinomycin in concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-6)m, respectively, inhibited the growth of Streptococcus faecalis. Inhibition of growth was associated with loss of Rb(+) and K(+) from the cells, and could be reversed by addition of excess K(+). Cells treated with these antibiotics exhibited greatly increased permeability to certain cations; no effect was observed on the penetration of other small molecules. Unlike normal cells, cells treated with gramicidin rapidly lost internal Rb(+) by passive exchange with external cations, including H(+), all monovalent alkali metals, NH(4) (+), Mg(++), and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. Exchange was rapid even at 0 C and was independent of energy metabolism. The effect of valinomycin was more selective. Cellular Rb(+) was rapidly displaced by external H(+), K(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+); other cations were less effective. The exchange was independent of metabolism but strongly affected by temperature. Under certain conditions, polyvalent cations inhibited exchange between (86)Rb and Rb(+) induced by valinomycin. The antibiotic apparently neither stimulates nor inhibits the energy-dependent K(+) pump of S. faecalis, but exerts its effect on the passive permeability of the membrane to cations. The increased permeability to specific cations induced by gramicidin and valinomycin is a sufficient explanation for the inhibition of growth, glycolysis, and other processes.

AB  - Some characteristics of a fumarate reductase from Streptococcus faecalis are described. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.4; optimal activity was observed when the ionic strength of the phosphate buffer was adjusted to 0.088. The K(m) value of the enzyme for reduced flavin mononucleotide was 2 x 10(-4)m as determined with a 26-fold preparation. In addition to fumarate, the enzyme reduced maleate and mesaconate. No succinate dehydrogenase activity was detected, but succinate did act as an inhibitor of the fumarate reductase activity. Other inhibitors were malonate, citraconate, and trans-, trans-muconate. Metal-chelating agents did not inhibit the enzyme. A limited inhibition by sulfhydryl-binding agents was observed, and the preparations were sensitive to air oxidation and storage. Glycine, alanine, histidine, and possibly lysine stimulated fumarate reductase activity in the cell-free extracts. However, growth in media supplemented with glycine did not enhance fumarate reductase activity. The enzymatic activity appears to be constitutive.

AB  - Techniques for culturing, harvesting, and testing bacteria to evaluate bactericidal chemicals for swimming pools are described. Concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mg of the chlorine stabilizer cyanuric acid per liter increased the time required for a 99% kill of Streptococcus faecalis by 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter at pH 7.4 and 20 C from less than 0.25 min without cyanuric acid to 4, 6, and 12 min, respectively. The effect of concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in the range found in swimming pools on the rate of kill of 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter and of chlorine plus cyanuric acid was tested. At concentrations of ammonia nitrogen greater than 0.05 mg per liter, faster rates of kill of S. faecalis were obtained with 100 mg of cyanuric acid per liter plus 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter than with 0.5 mg of chlorine per liter alone. When water samples from four swimming pools with low ammonia levels were used as test media, 0.5 mg of added chlorine per liter killed 99.9% of the added S. faecalis in less than 2 min, but water from a pool with a large number of children required 60 to 180 min of treatment.

AB  - In cell-free extracts derived from Streptococcus faecalis, protein synthesis directed by endogenous messenger RNA increases as the culture ages. The increased activity is accompanied by an increase in the percentage of membranebound ribosomes and by a decrease in ribosomal monomers and subunits. These changes progress against a background of structural and compositional modifications in the membrane. Membrane modifications possibly related to endogenously directed protein synthesis in cell-free extracts include: (i) decreased specific activity of a membrane-associated polynucleotide phosphorylase capable of polysome degradation, and (ii) increased concentrations of certain phospholipids.

Bacteriol. 92:1311-1314. 1966.-Streptococcus faecalis N83 and S. faecium K6A reduced several compounds of Group VI elements to the elemental form, but reduced none of several compounds tested containing elements of other groups. The elemental tellurium deposited by S. faecium K6A was in general of a larger particle size than that deposited by S. faecalis N83 as judged from X-ray diffraction analysis. The particle size of the deposited tellurium was correlated with the blackness of the precipitate produced by cells growing in the presence of tellurite. A black and gray variation was observed in S. faecium K6A which was considered to be due to particle size, the amount of tellurium present, and the location of the deposited tellurium. The gray color of S. faecium K6A was not due to the presence of any oxidized tellurium products.

Bacteriol. 92:707-713. 1966.-The effect of environmental pantothenate levels on the growth of Streptococcus faecalis 9790 was studied in terms of growth rate, depletion phenomena, cellular coenzyme A (CoA) content, and differential rates of wall and membrane synthesis. Low concentrations of pantothenate yielded normal exponential growth curves up to peak turbidities which are a function of pantothenate concentration. Attainment of these peaks was followed by lysis. Under such conditions, bacterial CoA increased initially in proportion with cell substance, but attained a peak level much earlier than cell substance, and then gradually decreased down to vanishing amounts. With higher pantothenate concentrations, cellular CoA levels increased to a maximum, and, under these conditions, the CoA content remained constant during exponential growth. Four-fifths of the pantothenate requirement of growing cells was eliminated by environmental oleate and palmitate. When CoA disappeared during growth on low pantothenate levels, cell wall synthesis seemed to continue at nearly normal rates, but membrane synthesis was severely curtailed. The data suggest that in fermentative organisms pantothenate action might be confined to wall and membrane synthesis, that these two processes differ in their quantitative dependence on pantothenate, and that pantothenate might occur in the form of acyl carrier protein as well as CoA.

Bacteriol. 92:136-143. 1966.-A new method for mapping genetic loci on the bacterial chromosome, based on the linear progression of the deoxyribonucleic acid-replicating enzyme (replicase) in synchronous cultures of Streptococcus faecalis, is described. Ultraviolet irradiation was used to induce mutations to drug and to bacteriophage resistance at various intervals during the progress of the replicase along the chromosome. The time of duplication of the gene in synchronous populations was determined from reductions in the rates of irradiation-induced mutation. After the replication of various genes, the rates fell to half their former values. The resulting data made possible the construction of a 1-hr time-map indicating the sequence of replication of five genes in S. faecalis.

Bacteriol. 91:2257-2262. 1966.-Arsenate competitively inhibits the growth of Streptococcus faecalis, primarily by competition with phosphate for a common transport system. Arsenate is itself accumulated by the cells; the uptake requires metabolic energy, and the intracellular arsenate level may reach 0.01 m. Cells loaded with arsenate have lost the capacity to take up radioactive glutamate, rubidium, phosphate, or arsenate itself, apparently by the uncoupling of adenosine triphosphate generation. The pH dependence of arsenate uptake is complex. At low concentrations of extracellular arsenate, uptake by the wild-type strain 9790 exhibits a single maximum about pH 8; mutant PT-1, previously shown to be defective in phosphate uptake, takes up essentially no arsenate. At high concentrations of arsenate, uptake by the wild type is bimodal with maxima at pH 5.5 and 9; the uptake curve for mutant PT-1 corresponds to the shoulder in the curve for the wild type. The apparent dissociation constant for arsenate uptake by the wild type is approximately 10(-5)m from pH 5 to 9, whereas that for mutant PT-1 is about 5 x 10(-5) M at pH 5 and rises rapidly with increasing pH. The results confirm the earlier conclusion that the lesion in mutant PT-1 resides in the transport of phosphate and arsenate. It is proposed that the wild type has two distinct transport systems, whereas the mutant has lost the one with alkaline pH optimum.

AB  - l-Canavanine, an analogue of arginine, was found to stimulate the synthesis of an extracellular proteinase in Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens. Cells grown in a synthetic medium containing 10(-4)m arginine and 10(-4)m canavanine produced almost twice as much proteinase as cells grown in 2 x 10(-3)m arginine alone; total growth was the same in both media. Hydrolyzed proteinase samples were analyzed for arginine and canavanine by means of paper chromatography and electrophoresis. Arginine, but not canavanine, was detected in the purified enzyme sample.

It has been suggested that these temperature-dependent anomalies in the structure of water may have biological implications. After incubation in a polythermostat, direct cell counts were made to determine temperature-growth interactions for the four bacteria which were used to cover the temperature range from 5 to 70 C: Pseudomonas fragi, 5 to 25 C; Streptococcus faecalis, 20 to 40 C; Bacillus coagulans, 35 to 55 C; and B. stearothermophilus 1518 smooth, 50 to 70 C. In all cases, growth was suppressed at the predicted temperatures, suggesting a strong interaction between the structure of water and biological activity.

Growth  and virulence of Candida albicans after oral inoculation in the chick with a monoflora of either Escherichia coli or Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 91:1744-1749. 1966.-Bacterial protection against intestinal infection by Candida albicans was investigated in chicks with a monoflora of either Escherichia coli or Streptococcus faecalis. These animals were obtained by orally inoculating germ-free chicks (3 days old) with pure cultures of bacteria. Each bacterial species was established in large numbers in the gut of separate groups of animals within 24 hr of inoculation; these numbers were similar in chicks examined 34 days later, at which time all animals were killed. The numbers of bacteria from contents of the crop, small intestine, and ceca were similar in chicks with the E. coli monoflora. Comparable results were obtained in chicks with the S. faecalis monoflora, except for decreased numbers in the duodenum and jejunum. Some of the monoflora chicks (7 days old) were transferred into separate isolators, orally inoculated with C. albicans, and observed for 34 days. All chicks grew well and appeared healthy. However, examinations at autopsy revealed severe crop infections in chicks with a diflora containing S. faecalis. Preferential growth of hyphae (C. albicans) occurred in the lesions and throughout the gut. The numbers of S. faecalis in the gut were comparable to those found in unchallenged animals. Agglutinins against C. albicans were not detected in our test or control chicks. Chicks with a diflora containing E. coli and C. albicans had a few microscopic crop lesions containing small numbers of hyphae. C. albicans was well established in the gut of these animals, largely as the yeast form. The numbers of E. coli in the gut were similar to those in control chicks. Thus, it was concluded that E. coli provided protection against crop infection by C. albicans. In crop contents from unchallenged animals, chicks with S. faecalis monoflora were about pH 5, whereas birds with E. coli monoflora were about pH 7. The challenge did not greatly change the former value, and the latter was slightly decreased. In the crop of unchallenged birds, negative E(h) values were found in chicks with S. faecalis and positive E(h) values in those with E. coli. Challenge did not greatly change these values. These data on pH and E(h) were related to conditions for morphogenesis of C. albicans and virulence. No major difference in the concentrations of serum proteins was seen in chicks with E. coli or S. faecalis after challenge with C. albicans. Possible mechanisms of the protective effect of E. coli are discussed.

AB  - Studies on the germicidal activity of chlorine, bromine, and iodine were made by  use of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists official first action method for determining effectiveness of swimming pool water disinfectants. In this procedure, 0.3 ppm of available chlorine as chlorine gas has activity equivalent to 0.6 ppm of available chlorine in the buffered sodium hypochlorite control when Escherichia coli is used as the test organism. With Streptococcus faecalis as the test organism, 0.45 ppm of available chlorine as gaseous chlorine gives activity equivalent to the control. Liquid bromine at 1.0 ppm is as effective as the 0.6 ppm of available chlorine hypochlorite control with E. coli as the test organism, but 2.0 ppm of liquid bromine is necessary to provide activity equivalent to the 0.6 ppm of available chlorine control when S. faecalis is employed. With iodine as metallic iodine, 2.0 ppm is necessary to provide a result equivalent to the 0.6 ppm of available chlorine control with both E. coli and S. faecalis. In the various systems tested, gaseous chlorine was the most active form of available chlorine; liquid bromine provided the most active form of bromine, and metallic iodine provided the most active form of iodine.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth (BBL). Some of the effectors, e.g., Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, Lactobacillus lactis, L. brevis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of S. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most cultures were inhibitory, and some (S. faecium and L. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the Staphylococcus. Low-temperature meat lactobacilli and Leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited S. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 C throughout its growth. Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 C, as well. When the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat Lactobacillus, and L. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 C, and all but the meat Lactobacillus did so at 22 C. A ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 C, except that S. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by S. faecalis. A ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. In general, the more effector bacteria there were in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of S. aureus. Inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 C, less so at 20 or 25 C, and least at 30 or 37 C, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. Results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of S. aureus were similar, for the most part.
TI  - The biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid by rumen micro-organisms.
AB  - 1. alpha-[U-(14)C]Linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. A tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. The main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. Washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. Pure cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.

AB  - When 15 bacterial species representing genera associated with food-borne diseases were irradiated individually, all except Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis showed typical linear dose-survival curves in Hartsell's broth. The minimal lethal dose (MLD) for the organisms tested ranged from 3.0 x 10(5) to 6.0 x 10(5) rad. Salmonella paratyphi B, S. wichita, S. typhi, E. coli, and S. faecalis were found to be the least sensitive to radiation. In commercially canned crabmeat the survival curves of S. typhi, S. paratyphi B, and S. wichita exhibited to varying degrees an initial linear death decline with increasing radiation doses, followed by a distinct tailing effect caused by survival of low numbers at the higher doses. The above species of Salmonella were further individually subjected to gamma-radiation in various dilutions of crabmeat. The "tailing effect" gradually disappeared, with the dose-survival curve tending to become linear as the concentration of the crabmeat decreased.
TI  - Growth of lactic acid bacteria in waste waters of vegetable-processing plants.
AB  - Waters used in washing, blanching, cooling, and conveying vegetables during processing for freezing were filtered, sterilized, and inoculated with Streptococcus faecalis, S. lactis, or Lactobacillus plantarum. The contents of total nitrogen and total solids were determined, and ninhydrin tests and Benedict's tests for reducing sugars were performed. Substances positive to the ninyhydrin tests and also capable of supporting the growth of the bacteria to high levels of population were found in waters used to blanch cut green beans, but not in the cooling or conveying waters. They were found only in waters following slicing of blanched whole beans. They were also present in waters used in processing purple hull peas at all stages, but only in the waters used to blanch and cool lima beans. The substances were present in waters used to wash and blanch squash, but only in the waters used to blanch greens; they were not found in the cooling waters during the handling of either vegetable. No waters used in the processing of okra yielded a positive ninhydrin test, nor did they support the growth of the lactic acid bacteria.

AB  - Lynch, Judith L. (Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.), and Francis C. Neuhaus. On the mechanism of action of the antibiotic O-carbamyl-d-serine in Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 91:449-460. 1966.-The antibiotic O-carbamyl-d-serine, an analogue of d-alanine, is an inhibitor of bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis. Growth of Streptococcus faecalis R in the presence of O-carbamyl-d-serine resulted in the accumulation of the cell-wall precursor uridine diphosphate-NAc-muramyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-l- lysine (UDP-NAc-muramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys). The incorporation of d-alanine from l-alanine into peptidoglycan is catalyzed by the sequential action of the following enzymes: (i) alanine racemase; (ii) d-alanine: d-alanine ligase [adenosine diphosphate (ADP)]; (iii) UDP-NAc-muramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys: d-ala-d-ala ligase (ADP); (iv) phospho-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide translocase [uridine monophosphate (UMP)]. O-carbamyl-d-serine is an effective inhibitor of the alanine recemase (K(i)= 4.8 x 10(-4)m, K(m) of l-alanine = 6.8 x 10(-3)m). In addition, d-ala-O-carbamyl-d-ser was formed when d-alanine and O-carbamyl-d-serine were incubated with d-alanine: d-alanine ligase (ADP). This dipeptide was utilized by the UDP-NAc-muramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys: d-ala-d-ala ligase (ADP) with the formation of UDP-NAc-muramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala- O-carbamyl-d-ser. From a consideration of the following results, i.e., (i) accumulation of UDP-NAc-muramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys; (ii) absence of d-ala-O-carbamyl-d-ser accumulation in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of O-carbamyl-d-serine; and (iii) effective inhibition of the racemase, it was concluded that the first enzyme, the racemase, is the primary site of antibiotic action.

Bacteriol. 90:1013-1018. 1965.-The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pool has been studied throughout the growth cycle of Streptococcus faecalis. Normally, the pool is quantitatively related to the concentration of organisms and the growth rate, but deviations from these relationships can occur without affecting the growth rate of the organisms. A critical concentration of ATP seems necessary for exponential growth, and, at lower levels, only linear growth can occur. If no growth can take place, catabolism of added energy source gives rise to a large increase in the pool level. The pool level represents the balance between the demands of the organisms for energy and the supply of energy derived from catabolism of the substrate.

Bacteriol. 90:541-545. 1965.-Mixed inocula of Vibrio comma KC-4 and various lactic acid-forming bacteria were injected into the intestinal segments of rabbits (De and Chatterje, 1953) to observe the effects of the latter agents in altering the changes produced by strain KC-4. The animals were sacrificed 10 and 20 hr after inoculation. The inoculated intestinal segments were first examined grossly, and the amount of exudate in the segments, if any, was measured, after which the tissues were subjected to pathological examination. When KC-4 cells together with spore-bearing lactic acid-forming bacilli, strain P-22, or Lactobacillus casei were introduced, the intestinal segments showed few or no macroscopic and microscopic changes, and no accumulation of exudate. With mixed inoculation with lactic acid bacteria such as L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus lactis, and S. faecalis, changes were produced by strain KC-4. Macroscopically, no difference was discernible between the changes caused by mixed inoculation and those produced by single inoculation of KC-4. Upon pathological examination, however, it was seen that changes resulting from mixed inoculation were slightly less severe than those produced by inoculation with strain KC-4 only.

Bacteriol. 90:438-442. 1965.-It was shown earlier that depletion of different essential amino acids from the medium of growing Streptococcus faecalis leads to the formation of cell types of different compositions in terms of cytoplasm, wall, and membrane. The findings presented now indicate that these postexponential effects can be induced by very low concentrations of incomplete amino acid complements, that cystine and methionine have major and separate effects, and that these effects may be modulated differentially by the presence of different combinations of other amino acids.

Bacteriol. 90:347-351. 1965.-Certain strains of lactobacilli and pediococci incorporated hematin during growth, with the concomitant formation of cyanide- and azide-sensitive catalase. Three of five strains of lactobacilli and five of 25 strains of pediococci were capable of this biosynthesis. The pediococci required the heme component of blood, whereas the lactobacilli could incorporate the heme component in the form of purified and solubilized hemin or from blood. In all cases where inhibitor-sensitive enzyme was produced, it was accompanied by the production of inhibitor-insensitive enzyme. In the absence of hematin, only insensitive enzyme was obtained. Two catalase-positive strains of Streptococcus faecalis were found incapable of the synthesis of a heme-type enzyme, as was one member of the genus Leuconostoc. Iron and manganese in the growth medium stimulated the production of the insensitive catalase, but significant quantities of these metals could not be found in a purified enzyme preparation obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum. Aeration had little or no effect on growth, but it consistently doubled the amount of cyanide- and azide-resistant catalase. By means of conventional enzyme fractionation techniques, it was possible to separate the two different enzymes present in the cell-free extract of a strain of Pediococcus homari which had been grown in the presence of blood.

Bacteriol. 89:1448-1452. 1965.-The growth curve of Streptococcus faecalis in batch culture with limited energy source shows an initial portion of exponential growth where the growth yield coefficient Y(glucose) is 32, followed by linear growth where Y(glucose) is 21. Endogenous metabolism is correlated with maintenance of glycolytic activity, and there is a marked change in the glycolytic activity of cells harvested under these conditions; however, endogenous metabolism cannot be detected in either case by measurement of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pool in the organisms. Cells harvested after growth with excess energy source exhibit endogenous metabolism, which is correlated with a much higher concentration of ATP in the organisms than occurs in the cells grown with limited energy source.

AB  - 1. The effects of dietary biotin compared with vitamin B(12) on the total content and on the distribution of the various folate derivatives in the liver of rats given a biotin-free diet have been studied. The effect of both vitamins on the conversion in vitro of folic acid into citrovorum factor in the same experimental conditions was also examined. 2. In biotin-treated rats as well as in vitamin B(12)-treated rats the total content of folic acid-active substances measured microbiologically by Pediococcus cerevisiae, Streptococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei is significantly higher than that in biotin-deficient rats. The liver distribution of various folate derivatives in the three groups of animals is also markedly modified. 3. The amount of citrovorum factor formed in systems with liver homogenate of rats receiving biotin or vitamin B(12) is higher than that with liver homogenates of deficient rats. 4. The results obtained demonstrate the influence of biotin in the metabolism of folic acid, and the similar actions at this level of both biotin and vitamin B(12). These results are discussed in relation to the participation of the two vitamins in the metabolism of C(1) units, as a biochemical interpretation of the relationships between vitamin B(12) and biotin.
TI  - ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A NEW ANTIBIOTIC, ABBOTT 29119, FROM STREPTOMYCES ERYTHREUS.
AB  - A new antibiotic was isolated from fermentations of Streptomyces erythreus designed for erythromycin A production. Isolation of this compound was accomplished by use of ion-exchange chromatography and countercurrent distribution. It crystallized from methyl isobutyl ketone in colorless acicular plates which melted at 127 to 130 C. The empirical formula was C(42)H(75)NO(14) with a molecular weight of 820. Electrometric titration in 66% dimethylformamide showed an apparent pKa of 8.4. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet absorption indicated a close resemblance of the compound to known erythromycins, although its chromatographic behavior and solubility differed from those of the known erythromycins. Its antimicrobial spectrum was similar to erythromycin A, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations were much higher.

AB  - Pepper, Rollin E. (Michigan State University, East Lansing), and Ralph N. Costilow. Electron transport in Bacillus popilliae. J. Bacteriol. 89:271-276. 1965.-Bacillus popilliae was found to be unique among aerobic microorganisms in that it was deficient in a hydrogen peroxide-scavenging system. Neither catalase nor peroxidase was found. At the same time, a system for producing hydrogen peroxide during oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH(2)) was consistently present in the soluble fraction of extracts of cells from older cultures. Cells harvested from 9-hr cultures did not produce a significant amount of peroxide. The soluble NADH(2) oxidase was apparently a flavoprotein, since it was stimulated by flavin nucleotides, insensitive to cyanide and azide, and inhibited by Atabrine. Also, difference spectra demonstrated the presence of a reducible flavin in the soluble fraction of cell extracts. The particulate fraction of cell extracts was shown by difference spectra to contain cytochrome b(1); the strong inhibition of NADH(2) oxidation by cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide indicated that a terminal cytochrome oxidase was also present. This system was also flavin-dependent, since it was strongly inhibited by Atabrine. The specific activity of the NADH(2) oxidase in the particulate fraction was lower in extracts of cells from older cultures than in those from exponentially growing cultures. Cytochrome c was not found in extracts of these cells. It is believed that the increased participation of the hydrogen peroxide-generating NADH(2) oxidase in cells of older cultures may be responsible for the rapid loss in cell viability noted in stationary-phase cultures.

Bacteriol. 89:101-105. 1965.-Approximately 200 organisms were investigated for their ability to clot human and rabbit plasma. Various anticoagulants were used in preparing the plasma: acid-citrate-dextrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, balanced oxalate, potassium and sodium oxalates, and heparin. Twelve organisms were found which coagulated citrated plasma in less than 8 hr: four strains of Streptococcus faecalis; two strains of S. faecalis var. zymogenes; three strains of S. faecalis var. liquefaciens; and one strain each of S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Six strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus were selected for use as controls. Experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which these microorganisms coagulated citrated plasma. As this was the only plasma clotted, it was presumed that the citrate was utilized by the microorganisms, thereby releasing the calcium which was then made available so that normal physiological clotting could occur. To test this hypothesis, a chromatographic method was employed to determine the presence or absence of citrate. Coagulation tests, by use of increasing amounts of citrate, showed a linear relationship between the amount of citrate in the plasma and the coagulation time. It was demonstrated that the organisms must be actively metabolizing to clot citrated plasma. Proof for this was obtained by using a cell-free filtrate, to which thimerosal had been added to inhibit growth, instead of whole cultures for the coagulation test. Only the coagulase-positive staphylococci coagulated the citrated plasma under these conditions. From the results obtained, it was concluded that plasma coagulation by these organisms was by citrate utilization.
TI  - HAIR AS A RESERVOIR OF STAPHYLOCOCCI.
AB  - The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus in the hair of the scalp was investigated in three groups: out-patients, in-patients, and staff of a general hospital. Bacteria were grown from the hair of all the subjects tested and Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen isolated. It was found more frequently in the hair than in the nose but 20% of hair carriers of Staph. aureus were not nasal carriers. In hospital staff and in-patients, the staphylococci were highly resistant to antibiotics, and phage types usually classified as ;hospital staphylococci' predominated. There were more staphylococcal post-operative wound infections in hair carriers than in non-carriers, and in three cases the Staph. aureus was of the same phage type as that isolated pre-operatively from the hair.

AB  - Harold, F. M. (National Jewish Hospital, Denver, Colo.). Stabilization of Streptococcus faecalis protoplasts by spermine. J. Bacteriol. 88:1416-1420. 1964.-Lysis of protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis subjected to osmotic shock was prevented by the presence of 10(-3)m spermine and other divalent cations. Protein and nucleic acids were largely retained, but compounds of low molecular weight were discharged into the medium and the capacity for glycolysis was lost. Under these conditions, spermine was bound to the protoplasts. It could not be removed by washing with water or nonelectrolytes, but was displaced by salts, polyanions, and polycations. Removal of the spermine restored the osmotic fragility of the protoplasts, which could once again be protected from lysis by impermeant solutes. Protoplasts were also stabilized, in the absence of osmotic shock, by prolonged incubation with cations in 0.5 m sucrose. By either procedure, the protoplasts became resistant not only to osmotic lysis but also to sonic oscillation. It is concluded that the stabilization of protoplasts resulted from ionic binding of the cation to acidic sites on the external surface of the plasma membrane. This conferred upon the membrane additional mechanical strength, perhaps by the cross-linking of subunits, but did not alter its permeability to extracellular solutes.

AB  - Rogers, C. G. (Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), and W. B. Sarles. Isolation and identification of enterococci from the intestinal tract of the rat. J. Bacteriol. 88:965-973. 1964.-Surface inoculation was employed in a comparison of three selective media, M-enterococcus (M) agar, thallium acetate-glucose (TITG) agar, and KF-streptococcus (KF) agar, for enumeration and isolation of enterococci from contents of the digestive tract of the rat. Similar yields of enterococcus colonies were obtained with M, TITG, and KF agar. When cecal contents were examined, species identification of 120 isolates, 40 from each medium, revealed only minor differences in selective activity. Streptococcus faecalis and its variety zymogenes represented 55 to 63% of the isolates from each medium; the remaining strains resembled S. durans or S. faecium. More than 99% of the isolates failed to survive the heat-tellurite tolerance test. Periodic analyses of intestinal contents from young rats indicated that enterococci became established in the gut from 10 to 14 days after birth. The species isolated most frequently on M agar was S. faecalis var. zymogenes. When rats were fed a purified diet with casein as the source of nitrogen, S. faecalis var. zymogenes predominated among isolates from contents of the small intestine plated on M agar. This species was largely replaced by others resembling S. durans or S. faecium when mixtures of l-amino acids provided the dietary nitrogen. Nineteen enterococcus isolates, representing all that met the Sherman criteria, required arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tryptophan, and valine; of these, two strains required in addition threonine, glycine, and lysine; four required threonine and glycine; two, threonine and lysine; and one, threonine.
TI  - FUMARATE REDUCTION AND ITS ROLE IN THE DIVERSION OF GLUCOSE FERMENTATION BY STREPTOCOCCUS FAECALIS.
AB  - Deibel, R. H. (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.), and M. J. Kvetkas. Fumarate reduction and its role in the diversion of glucose fermentation by Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 88:858-864. 1964.-Fumarate diverts the normal fermentation of glucose by Streptococcus faecalis FB82, as shown by the production of increased amounts of CO(2), formate, acetate, and acetoin, and decreased formation of lactate and ethanol. Experiments with d-glucose-1-C(14), in which low levels of labeled CO(2) were recovered, indicated that C-1 cleavage of the glucose molecule was not involved. The presence of fumarate afforded consistently larger cell crops in growth studies with glucose and other energy sources. On a molar growth-yield basis, anaerobically grown, glucose-fumarate cultures were equivalent to aerobically grown, glucose cultures. The reduction of fumarate by cell suspensions indicated that glucose, gluconate, and, to a lesser extent, glycerol and mannitol could serve as hydrogen donors. Several common metabolic inhibitors had no effect upon the fumarate reductase system in cell suspensions, although some sensitivity to acidic pH was noted. Significant levels of succinate oxidation activity were not detected. Fumarate reductase activity was demonstrated in all five S. faecalis strains tested. Distribution of this ability in S. faecium strains was variable, ranging from activity comparable with that of S. faecalis to total inactivity. The observations support the conclusion that fumarate functions as an alternate hydrogen acceptor, thus allowing pyruvate to participate in the energy-yielding phosphoroclastic and dismutation pathways.

AB  - Bleiweis, Arnold S. (The Pennsylvania State University, University Park), and Leonard N. Zimmerman. Properties of proteinase from Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens. J. Bacteriol. 88:653-659. 1964.-The extracellular group D streptococcal proteinase is inactivated by chelating agents [ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (EDTA), o-phenanthroline, and 8-quinolinol] and mercaptans (cysteine, mercaptoethanol, and thioglycolate). The optimal inhibitory concentrations of EDTA (4 x 10(-4)m) and cysteine (2.5 x 10(-2)m) promote rapid loss of activity with 50% inactivation after 4 to 5 min. Enzyme inactivated by either EDTA or cysteine is reactivated about 80% by 4 x 10(-4)m Zn(++). Such reactivation of EDTA-treated enzyme is prevented completely by iodoacetate (5 x 10(-2)m) and of cysteine-treated enzyme by oxidizing conditions, which suggests that the zinc binding-site may be a thiol. High levels of zinc (10(-3)m) do not allow reactivation in either case, and actually inhibit native proteinase. Ca(++), Mg(++), Co(++), Fe(++), Cu(++), and Ni(++) do not reactivate cysteine-treated enzyme, but Mn(++) (10(-4) to 8 x 10(-4)m) allows 27% reversal. N(2)-held, cysteine-treated enzyme can be spontaneously reactivated if the substrate is flushed with O(2) during the assay; leakage of air or O(2) into the samples before assay leads to loss of reactivatability. Native proteinase does not lose activity after dialysis for 43 hr against 0.07 m phosphate buffer. It is concluded that the group D proteinase obtained from Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens is probably a zinc metalloenzyme that is unlike the thiol-activated, group A streptococcal proteinase, but similar to the mammalian carboxypeptidase A.
TI  - CATALASE ACTIVITY OF TWO STREPTOCOCCUS FAECALIS STRAINS AND ITS ENHANCEMENT BY AEROBIOSIS AND ADDED CATIONS.
AB  - Jones, Dorothy (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.), R. H. Deibel, and C. F. Niven, Jr. Catalase activity of two Streptococcus faecalis strains and its enhancement by aerobiosis and added cations. J. Bacteriol. 88:602-610. 1964.-The nature of catalase activity noted in two unusual Streptococcus faecalis strains was determined. Enzyme activity was lost slowly when cultures were maintained by daily transfer in test tubes of broth media. Loss of activity could be prevented by aerobic culture. Supplementation of the growth medium with ferric, manganese, and zinc ions, as well as aerobiosis, enhanced catalase activity. However, addition of these cations to cell suspensions or to cell-free extracts did not increase catalase activity. Although oxygen was observed to be one of the reaction end products, the catalase activity was not inhibited by cyanide or azide, and the iron-porphyrin coenzyme of classical catalase was not detected. The enzyme was purified 185-fold by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, followed by chromotography on a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column.

Approximately 20% of the original enzyme activity was recovered in the purified fraction. Optimal enzyme activity was found to be at pH 7.6 and 35 C. The enzyme is apparently more susceptible to heat denaturation when complexed with substrate than when heated in the absence of substrate. Michaelis-Menten constants were found to be 0.655% for hemoglobin and 0.133% for casein. Apparent energies of activation on these substrates were calculated to be 9,060 and 12,020 cal, respectively.

Bacteriol. 88:4-10. 1964.-Streptococcus faecalis, as opposed to S. faecium, utilizes pyruvate as an energy source for growth. The fermentation is adaptive, as demonstrated by growth experiments in a casein-hydrolysate medium and the fermentation of pyruvate by cell suspensions. The principal products of pyruvate catabolism were acetoin, CO(2), and lactic, acetic, and formic acids, although carbon recoveries were low due to the formation of slime. End-product analyses suggested that both the phosphoroclastic and dismutation systems were active in pyruvate breakdown. Studies with cell-free extracts indicated a thiamine diphosphate requirement for active pyruvate catabolism. The involvement of lipoic acid in the phosphoroclastic system was investigated, and, although inconclusive results were obtained, no association of this cofactor with phosphoroclastic activity could be made.

AB  - Brock, Thomas D. (Indiana University, Bloomington). Host range of certain virulent and temperate bacteriophages attacking group D streptococci. J. Bacteriol. 88:165-171. 1964.-Host range studies with five bacteriophages isolated from sewage showed that a high degree of strain specificity occurred among the species Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. Certain phages were able to attack various members of these subgroups but not other members. A high degree of strain specificity was also found with respect to eight phages attacking strains of S. faecium. Many strains of this latter group were resistant to all the phages available. The only firm conclusion was that no phage attacked both S. faecium and S. faecalis strains. In several selected strains of the S. faecalis-liquefaciens-zymogenes group, resistance to several virulent phages seemed to be related to the presence of certain prophages in these strains. A search for transduction with the temperate phages was unsuccessful. Mutants of S. faecium 8043 resistant to certain growth-factor analogues showed unpredictable changes in resistance and sensitivity to two virulent phages.
TI  - ACTIVITY OF AMPICILLIN IN VITRO COMPARED WITH OTHER ANTIBIOTICS.
AB  - Comparative tests in vitro for antibacterial activity were carried out with ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol using 673 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Streptococcus faecalis. Further comparative tests were also carried out with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, colistin sulphate, colistin methane sulphonate, cycloserine, kanamycin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, using groups of 20 strains of each of the main species selected at random from the total number of isolates. Of the total number of isolates a higher percentage was inhibited by ampicillin than by tetracycline or chloramphenicol. Ampicillin showed particularly high activity against certain species of bacteria and displayed an antibacterial spectrum not shown by any of the other antibiotics tested.

Bacteriol. 87:988-992. 1964.-Although both Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium (and its variety durans) hydrolyze arginine, the utilization of this amino acid as an energy source appears to have taxonomic utility, as only S. faecalis and its varieties can couple the resultant energy with growth processes. Utilization of arginine by S. faecalis in a semisynthetic, casein-hydrolysate medium requires small concentrations of a fermentable carbohydrate (0.05%), presumably for synthetic reactions. The arginine analogue, agmatine, is utilized as an energy source by S. faecalis but not by S. faecium, and only approxinately 50% of the latter strains hydrolyzed this compound. Other ureido- and guanido-containing compounds tested were neither utilized as an energy source nor deaminated.

AB  - Albrecht, Alberta M. (Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, N.Y.), and Dorris J. Hutchison. Repression by adenine of the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase in an antifolic-resistant mutant of Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 87:792-798. 1964.-In an amethopterin-resistant mutant of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 under cultivation conditions requiring purine synthesis de novo, both the dihydrofolate reductase and the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase were formed as constant fractions of the total protein synthesized during the exponential phase of growth. When excess adenine was added to the medium, the rate of formation of the synthetase was markedly decreased, i.e., repressed. Under these latter conditions, the synthesis of the reductase proceeded at a rate equal to that observed in the absence of adenine. The repressibility of the synthetase by adenine was demonstrated also by the decrease in rate of synthetase formation upon the addition of adenine to a culture actively synthesizing this enzyme. Guanine and hypoxanthine, like adenine, also repressed the synthetase; exogenous xanthine was less effective. Neither of the pyrimidines, thymine and uracil, at approximately 1 mug/ml, interfered with synthesis of the two enzymes.

AB  - Goddard, J. L. (University of Oklahoma School of Medicine, Oklahoma City), and J. R. Sokatch. 2-Ketogluconate fermentation by Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 87:844-851. 1964.-Streptococcus faecalis 10Cl did not grow with 2-ketogluconate alone as an energy source, but did grow when gluconate was added. More growth was obtained than could be accounted for by the gluconate alone. The requirement for gluconate in the stimulation of growth on 2-ketogluconate was found to be stoichiometric, not catalytic. Glucose did not replace gluconate in this phenomenon, apparently owing to the repression of the 2-ketogluconate pathway by glucose. Resting cells grown on a combination of gluconate and 2-ketogluconate did ferment 2-ketogluconate without added gluconate. Fermentation balance studies with resting cells detected the following products in moles (per mole of 2-ketogluconate): carbon dioxide, 0.98; lactic acid, 0.19; formic acid, 1.42; acetic acid, 0.70; and ethanol, 0.42. 2-Ketogluconate-1-C(14) and -2-C(14) were prepared and fermented. The data were interpreted to show that 90% of the substrate was decarboxylated to carbon dioxide and pentose phosphate. Pentose phosphate was then fermented to pyruvate through the sedoheptulose diphosphate variation of the pentose phosphate pathway found in this organism. The other 10% of the substrate was converted to pyruvate by way of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Calculations of the energy available by the above combination of pathways indicated that about 2.3 moles of adenosine triphosphate per mole of 2-ketogluconate could be obtained if the energy available in acetate formation is conserved through the acetokinase reaction.

Bacteriol. 87:815-822. 1964.-With Streptococcus faecalis F24, it was demonstrated: that the citrulline transport mechanism, induced by growth in arginine, follows enzyme kinetics; that cell membranes from induced and noninduced cells differ considerably in their ability to adsorb citrulline; that protoplasts demonstrate a similar selectivity; and that, throughout various alterations of the growth medium and growth conditions, a consistent difference in citrulline uptake between induced and noninduced cells was present. A proposed explanation based on experimental findings is offered.

AB  - Raycroft, Ruth E. (The Pennsylvania State University, University Park), and L. N. Zimmerman. New mode of genetic transfer in Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens. J. Bacteriol. 87:799-801. 1964.-When chloramphenicol-resistant mutants are grown in mixed culture with the sensitive wild type of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens 31, a transfer of chloramphenicol resistance occurs. (The marker is stable through at least five transfers.) The transfer mechanism is not inhibited by deoxyribonuclease, nor is it phage-mediated; genetic transfer is apparently dependent upon cell contact. Although kinetic studies have yet to be completed, preliminary data indicate a high efficiency (2.2 per donor cell in some experiments) of transmission. Two levels of drug resistance, 7 and 50 mug, were transferred; in each case, recipient cells expressed the donor's degree of resistance.

Bacteriol. 87:786-791. 1964.-Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 and three of its mutants resistant to amethopterin were compared for their quantitative requirements for serine, purines, and thymine; for their quantitative requirements of folic acid (FA) for the synthesis de novo of serine, purines, and thymine; for the susceptibility to amethopterin of each pathway; and for the relative capacity of resting cells of each culture to synthesize N(5)-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHOFAH(4)) from FA and serine or FA and formate. The mutants were found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively different from one another and from the wild strain. The growth conditions, specifically the composition of the medium in which each mutant strain was selected, had a marked effect on the metabolic capacities of the mutants. The ability to synthesize serine, purines, and thymine, as observed from the FA requirements, directly reflected the level of resistance of each pathway to amethopterin. The resistant mutants were more efficient than the wild strain in the formation of 5-CHOFAH(4) from FA and formate and, furthermore, this formate activation paralleled their capacities in the synthesis de novo of serine. Alterations in purine and thymine biosyntheses were also observed.

AB  - Walker, D. J. (CSIRO, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia), and W.  W. Forrest. Endogenous metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 87:256-262. 1964.-Washed suspensions of Streptococcus faecalis incubated in phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) under anaerobic conditions released amino acids into the suspending medium. Little or no carbohydrate was released in soluble form, and no acid production could be detected. Cell lipid was stable, and only a small amount of nucleotide (material absorbing at 260 mmu) was released. Estimates of total carbon produced in soluble form showed that this could be almost entirely accounted for as amino acid. Over the short period during which amino acid was produced (up to 5 hr), the glycolytic activity of the cells remained fairly constant, and fell slowly thereafter to low values in 24 to 48 hr; the rate of fall depended on cell concentration. Whereas exogenous sources of energy protected against loss of glycolytic activity, arsenate, hydroxylamine, or replacement of phosphate by other buffers accelerated loss of glycolytic activity. Restoration of glycolytic activity in aged cells could be achieved by incubation with amino acids plus an energy source, with concurrent synthesis of protein but no apparent growth. Ammonium ion was not effective in protecting or restoring glycolytic activity. The nature of changes which took place during endogenous metabolism are discussed.

AB  - This study considers the sanitary significance of coliforms, fecal coliforms, and streptococci isolated from 152 species of plants and 40 samples of insects. These specimens were collected from various ecological environments and grouped into several categories. Results indicate that typical coliforms of the warm-blooded animal gut contribute a relatively small percentage of the organisms associated with vegetation (14.1%) and insects, (14.9%). A total of 1,203 coliform strains from vegetation and 1,084 coliform strains from insects were classified as to IMViC type and fecal coliform. No type was predominant in either the vegetation or insect groupings. The biochemical results for 646 streptococci from vegetation and 226 cultures from insects were reported. The predominant group, Streptococcus fecalis, as defined by Sherman criteria, constituted a majority of all strains from vegetation and insects. The "Completed Coliform Test" is recommended for the examination of plant and insect specimens to eliminate the many anaerobic and aerobic sporeforming bacteria that frequently produce false positive reactions by the "Confirmed Test" procedure. These findings support the current interpretation of the significance of the fecal coliform test for stream investigations or for surface water quality evaluations.

Bacteriol. 87:97-103. 1964.-A factor present in plant and animal sources was found necessary for the incorporation of formate-C(14) into pyruvate by Streptococcus faecalis 10Cl. Yeast extract produced a response linear in the range between 10 and 30 mg/ml of reaction mixture. Soy peptone, beef peptone, and Brain Heart Infusion replaced yeast extract, but various intermediates, cofactors, amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, and peptides did not stimulate the reaction. A lag occurred in the rate of formate incorporation that was not influenced by anaerobic conditions or growth of cells in a medium containing pyruvate and formate. Phosphate or maleate buffer permitted rapid exchange velocities but tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or collidine buffer was inhibitory. Heating yeast extract at 121 C for 15 min in 3 n H(2)SO(4) produced 66% inactivation of the factor(s), whereas treatment with 3 n KOH produced 97% inactivation. The factor(s) was insoluble in butanol, benzene, ethyl acetate, or chloroform. The material adsorbed on Dowex-1 (OH(-)) and Amberlite IR-120 (H(+)) but not on Amberlite IR-4B (OH(-)). The active component(s) was highly polar, nonvolatile, dialyzable, and had amphoteric properties.

Bacteriol. 87:104-113. 1964.-In contrast to intact cells of Streptococcus faecalis, no stimulation of the formate-pyruvate exchange reaction was observed in cell extracts when yeast extract was added to the reaction mixture. A heated extract of Micrococcus lactilyticus, vitamin K(5), ferrous sulfate, and ferrous ammonium sulfate stimulated an active exchange by protecting the system from oxygen. Tetrahydrofolate, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, and sodium sulfide provided partial protection, whereas ascorbate, glutathione, sodium hydrosulfite, ammonium sulfide, and sodium bisulfite gave insufficient protection or were inhibitory. Oxidation-reduction (O-R) indicators were not inhibitory and were used to estimate the O-R potentials of reaction mixtures. A potential at least as negative as -125 mv was estimated to be necessary to preserve or initiate formate-pyruvate exchange activity. The reaction operated over a narrow pH range when strict anaerobic conditions were not maintained but, when the system was suitably poised, the pH range was broader. The influence of high phosphate concentrations was less under strictly anaerobic conditions, and orthophosphate could be replaced by small amounts of pyrophosphate. Effect of temperature, time, and amount of extract is presented. Addition of reduced benzyl viologen and hydrogen-saturated palladium in the buffer during 8 hr of dialysis prevented inactivation of extracts. Recovery of activity could be obtained after ammonium sulfate treatment when a combination of palladium chloride, neutral red, and hydrogen bubbling were used.

Bacteriol. 86:1275-1282. 1963-Studies on a collection of enterococci isolated from diverse sources have confirmed the existence of two distinct species, namely, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. In contrast with S. faecium, S. faecalis characteristically ferments melezitose, sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobically), citrate, and gluconate; fails to ferment arabinose and melibiose; has strong reducing capacities as demonstrated by prompt reduction of litmus in milk or tetrazolium in an agar medium; initiates growth on an agar medium containing 0.04% potassium tellurite; does not require folic acid for growth; and does not produce strong greening in blood agar. S. liquefaciens and S. zymogenes differ from S. faecalis only in their proteolytic capacities and, therefore, deserve only varietal status. Some S. faecalis and S. faecium strains are proteolytic when tested on agar media. S. durans differs from S. faecium only in its inability to ferment arabinose and mannitol, and the failure of most strains to ferment sucrose. Therefore, it should be considered as a variety of S. faecium. It is recommended that the term "enterococcus" be used only when referring to S. faecalis and S. faecium, and their respective varieties.

AB  - A bioassay for tyrothricin, based on a procedure used by Szybalski in bacterial resistance studies, was developed. Replacement of the tube dilution assay with this procedure represented economy in time and equipment, with a resultant increase in productivity. The procedure involved preparation of special agar plates which provided graded concentrations of tyrothricin along a horizontal axis. A culture dish was inclined, and a base layer of agar, without antibiotic, was poured to cover the bottom of the dish and allowed to harden. A second layer of agar, containing 1 ppm of tyrothricin, was poured and allowed to harden with the dish in a level position. Diffusion of the antibiotic from the top layer into the bottom layer yielded a concentration gradient. A third thin layer of agar seeded with Streptococcus faecalis was poured on the surface. After incubation, a bacterial growth front, representing the minimal effective concentration (MEC), developed. The MEC is expressed as distance (in millimeters) from the edge of the plate. Unknowns were directly related to a standard preparation for calculation of tyrothricin concentration.

In addition, the cell cytoplasm contained kinases specific for fructose, mannose, and galactose. No specific kinases were found for gluconate or mannitol, although in the presence of mannitol adenosine triphosphate was utilized by a cytoplasmic fraction. The possibility is discussed that the main pathways of gluconate and mannitol metabolism are oxidation followed by phosphorylation.

AB  - Brock, Thomas D. (Indiana University, Bloomington) and Joseph M. Davie. Probable  identity of a group D hemolysin with a bacteriocine. J. Bacteriol. 86:708-712. 1963.-All strains of Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) produce a bacteriocine which is active against lactic acid bacteria and most other grampositive bacteria. Mutants which have lost the hemolytic characteristic lose at the same time their bacteriocine-producing ability. A strain which was resistant to the bacteriocine but which was nonhemolytic and nonbacteriocinogenic was irradiated, and two hemolytic mutants were isolated from it. These mutants were also bacteriocinogenic. Thus, the two activities are gained or lost together by mutation. Both activities are destroyed by chloroform vapors and are antagonized by lecithin. Both activities are destroyed at the same rate by treatment at 45 C under mildly acid conditions, and both activities are stable when heated in agar. The two activities are produced in parallel during the growth cycle, and disappear in parallel. The possible ecological role of a substance which is both a hemolysin and a bacteriocine is discussed.

On the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. Type 1 is produced by all Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. Type 2 is produced by some S. liquefaciens (S. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. Type 3 is produced by certain strains of both S. faecalis and S. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group D streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except Leuconostoc citrovorum. Type 4 is produced by certain S. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. Type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of S. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. The strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. No strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.

Bacteriol. 86:490-493. 1963.-l-Canavanine, a competitive inhibitor of arginine, was found to stimulate the growth of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens in the presence of arginine. This growth stimulation by canavanine was unique, since it previously was found to inhibit the growth of organisms which require arginine. When equimolar concentrations of arginine and canavanine were tested from 10(-7) to 10(-2)m, maximal stimulation occurred at 10(-4)m. Canavanine concentrations of 5 x 10(-6)m to 10(-2)m stimulated growth in the presence of 5 x 10(-5)m arginine. Ornithine similarly stimulated growth. Canavanine inhibited the rate of arginine degradation by the arginine dihydrolase enzyme system in intact cells. It is assumed that the mechanism of canavanine stimulation involves an inhibition of arginine desimidase of the arginine dihydrolase enzyme system, which in turn makes more arginine available for growth over a longer period of time.

Bacteriol. 85:1378-1385. 1963.-Enterococcus bacteriophages were isolated by an enrichment procedure from the contents of the small intestines of Sprague-Dawley white rats. After purification by single-plaque isolation, the phages were maintained in Tryptose broth by propagation on strains of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes of similar intestinal origin. The presence of two phage strains was suggested from host range studies, and confirmed by antiserum neutralization tests, whereby the bacteriophages were placed in two distinct, but serologically related, groups. When the characteristics of one phage from each group were studied, differences were observed in antigenic properties, as shown by the ability to stimulate antibody production in rabbits, and in single-step growth characteristics. At 32 C, the latent period was 21 min, and the burst size was 88 plaque-forming particles (PFP) for phage 1; and 34 min and 147 PFP for phage 2. The bacteriophages were similar in temperature of inactivation, sensitivity to pH, and in rates of adsorption to host cells (K = about 2 x 10(-9) ml/min at 32 C). In electron micrographs, the viruses were characterized by slightly elongated heads and long tails, and resembled one another closely. The dimensions of the phage particles were similar to those reported for other phage-host systems within the genus Streptococcus.

TI  - FOOD-POISONING POTENTIAL OF THE ENTEROCOCCI.
AB  - Deibel, R. H. (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.), and J. H. Silliker. Food-poisoning potential of the enterococci. J. Bacteriol. 85:827-832. 1963.-A total of 23 enterococcus strains were fed to two and sometimes three human volunteers in an effort to elicit food-poisoning symptoms. Each culture was consumed after it was grown in whole sterile milk or on the surface of commercially sterile ham slices. Six strains of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens were consumed after complete liquefaction of gelatin. In addition, strains of S. faecalis were consumed after having been grown in media which altered the energy metabolism (arginine, gluconate, malate, and pyruvate). In no instance were any of the above conditions of growth conducive to the production of food-poisoning symptoms in the volunteers. Moreover, no evidence was found to indicate that either the age of the culture or the disruption of the cell was a factor in the production or release of a toxic principle. It would appear that until the environmental conditions (if any) for food poisoning are defined the evidence obtained suggests that the association of enterococci and food poisoning is questionable.

AB  - Ikawa, Miyoshi (University of California, Berkeley). Nature of the lipids of some lactic acid bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 85:772-781. 1963.-Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus cerevisiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were grown on a lipid-free medium, and the amounts of acetone-soluble lipids, acetone-insoluble phospholipids, and unextracted or bound lipid in the cells were estimated. Neutral glycerides appeared to be absent, or present only in traces, in L. casei and S. faecalis. L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides, and P. cerevisiae, in addition to containing glycerides, appeared to contain glycolipids of glucose and galactose. Glycerol was present in the phospholipid fraction of all the organisms, and, in addition, galactose was present in L. mesenteroides. Paper chromatography of hydrolysates of the phospholipid fractions showed the absence of the usual phospholipid nitrogen bases, serine, ethanolamine, and choline, in these organisms. Microbiological assays of lyophilized unextracted cells for myo-inositol and choline also showed that lipids containing these components occurred in very small amounts at most. The principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the phospholipid fraction of L. casei, L. plantarum, P. cerevisiae, and S. faecalis was lysine, which seemed to be exclusively of the l configuration. The principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the L. mesenteroides phospholipid fraction was d-alanine. These amino acids appeared to be bound in components of the phospholipid fraction and not free.

TI  - Occurrence of enterococci on plants in a wild environment.
AB  - Enterococci were obtained from 14% of nearly 2,200 flowers, 3.4% of non-floral structures of angiosperms, and from 8.3% of samples of soil, water, and lesser plants of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, an area little influenced by the presence of man. The enterococci were recovered from one or more flowers or flower clusters of 1,515 samples in 47 taxa, but not from flowers of 67 taxa with 654 samples. The per cent of recovery was influenced adversely by dense forest cover and by increase in elevation, as compared with recovery from flowers in sunny locations in the lower elevations. The per cent recovery increased directly with rising seasonal temperature, with the maximal per cent of recovery occurring in September. In no instance did all samples of a species of flower or plant yield enterococci on culture, and with only three genera, Cacalia, Delphinium, and Mitchella, were the bacteria obtained from more than 50% of the samples. Approximately 11% of the cultures isolated were identified as Streptococcus faecalis, 64% as the soft curd producing, caseolytic variant of S. faecalis, 4% as S. faecalis var. zymogenes, and 20% as S. faecium. The per cent distribution of these species on plants was reasonably similar to the distribution within wild animals in the same environment. It was concluded that the enterococci occurring on plants arise commonly from the wild animals, and that they do not represent plant-specific species or variants of the enterococci.
TI  - Occurrence of enterococci in animals in a wild environment.
AB  - Enterococci were obtained from the feces of 71% of 216 mammals, 86% of 70 reptiles, and 32% of 22 birds sampled in a truly wild environment, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Patterns of food dependence and also of species dependence were observed. Among the lower classes of the primarily herbivorous mammals, the enterococci occurred sporadically; however, of the six species of Sciuridae, the gray squirrel, and of four species of Cricetidae, the red-backed mouse, the enterococci appear to be natural hosts. The enterococci were not obtained from most specimens of moles, shrews, or rabbits but they were obtained from most specimens of bats and from the carnivorous mammals, such as fox, bear, raccon, skunk, and boar. Streptococcus faecalis was obtained from 12 reptiles, and a caseolytic variant was obtained from 37 specimens of the reptiles. The strongly reducing, tellurite-tolerant species, S. faecalis, its caseolytic variant, and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were isolated from 127 or 41% of 308 specimens cultured. S. faecium was recovered from 87 or 28% of the animals, chiefly from the wild boar (60 of 64 trials) and the black bear. S. zymogenes was obtained from 1 of 31 bats, 3 of 12 raccoons, and 1 of 3 owls.

Protoplast membrane of Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 85:168-176. 1963.-The membrane fraction of Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 9790) was isolated and purified, by a variety of procedures, from cultures that were grown under closely controlled conditions of physiological age and nutrition. The most satisfactory method required the use of lysozyme-to-cell ratios below 0.01 and the intermediate formation of protoplasts in osmotically protective media. Amino acid analyses of three of the membrane preparations indicated a characteristic and constant, but not unusual, pattern; 42% of the membranes from threonine-depleted and 49 to 55% of the membranes from log-phase cultures were accounted for as protein. Significant quantities of d-alanine or d-aspartic acid were not detected, indicating the absence of contaminating cell-wall substance. Essentially, all of the nitrogen was accounted for as amino acids. The lipid content of membranes from stationary-phase threonine-depleted (36%) and valine-depleted (40%) cultures was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction of exponential-phase cultures (28%). The phosphorus content of the membrane lipid was relatively constant (2.8 to 3.0%), and the nitrogen content was extremely low (0.12 to 0.26%). Thus, changes in the composition of the membrane fraction occurred during the transition of log-phase cells into threonine- or valine-depleted cells.

Two factors appear to be involved in the oxidation of glycerol. One factor was shown to be an inducer of the enzyme system required for glycerol oxidation; the other was shown to be alpha-lipoic acid. Minute quantities of glucose will "spark" growth of S. faecalis in a medium containing glycerol and acetate as carbon sources, probably by supplying sufficient energy for induction of the glycerol-oxidation system.

Bacteriol. 84:1094-1098. 1962.-Incubation of whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis F24 in the presence of the crystalline egg-white lysozyme and appropriate sucrose concentration resulted in the formation of discrete spherical structures. On dilution, these osmotically fragile structures lysed immediately. Methyl pentose determinations on isolated cell walls and protoplast membranes verified the presence of rhamnose in the cell walls and its essentially complete absence in protoplast membranes. Cell walls were rendered soluble by lysozyme. After lysozyme treatment of cell walls, 96% of the rhamnose present was not sedimented by centrifugation at 12,500 x g for 30 min. No cell-wall structures were recognized by phasecontrast or electron microscopy. After direct lysis of whole cells of S. faecalis F24 by lysozyme, protoplast membranes were isolated. It is concluded that, in the strain of group D streptococcus studied, lysozyme effectively removes the cell wall.
TI  - Growth of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens on plants.
AB  - The proliferation of Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens on two varieties of beans, and on corn, rye, and cabbage was investigated. Comparisons were made with growth patterns on these same plants exhibited by S. lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. The ability of each of the bacteria to multiply and to spread to new plant parts as they developed from seed was studied under several environmental conditions. Plants were grown aseptically in glass culture and in sterilized and non-sterilized soil in the greenhouse. Quantitative estimations of increase in bacterial numbers were made. S. faecalis established commensal growth on each of five plants, although selectivity was noted for some plant parts. The organism increased in numbers on the plants equally as well as did the control bacteria, both alone, and in competition with the control bacteria and the microflora of the soil.

Bacteriol. 84:793-796. 1962.-The pathway by which galactose-1-C(14) is fermented in Streptococcus faecalis was investigated using dried-cell preparations. Lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide were the end products formed, with lactic acid representing approximately 50% of the sugar fermented. The distribution of radio-activity indicated that the fermentation follows the Embden-Meyerhof route, suggesting that the difference in the formation of the products of glucose and galactose fermentation must be attributed to alternate routes of pyruvic acid metabolism. Differences in pH did not account for the dissimilar fermentation patterns.

Growth rate values obtained in this manner agree with those obtained by conventional methods. The instrument is described in detail and reference is given to other uses of this type of photometer. The growth curves of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 and three mutants resistant to purine analogues were compared in media with and without a purine. Differences in these growth curves were evident. In the purine-deficient medium SF/AZAG, the 8-azaguanine-resistant mutant had the shortest doubling time, 61 min, followed by the two 6-mercaptopurine-resistant mutants (SF/MPcc, 72 min; SF/MP, 91 min), and finally the wild strain with a doubling time of 135 min. In the medium supplemented with xanthine, the respective doubling times were 52, 61, 68, and 68 min.

Bacteriol. 84:508-512. 1962.-The characteristics and requirements for growth of bacterial (Streptococcus faecalis) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protoplasts were established and the effect of a variety of antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics determined. A clear differentiation was obtained between such inhibitors of bacterial cell wall synthesis as penicillin and cycloserine, which did not prevent protoplast growth, and all others, antibacterial and antifungal, which inhibited protoplasts and intact organisms at the same range of concentration. Novobiocin, previously reported to inhibit bacterial wall synthesis, was also effective against a reaction(s) essential to the growth of S. faecalis protoplasts. The antibacterial action of streptomycin, neomycin, and kanamycin was essentially eliminated by the high salt concentration needed to maintain the protoplasts. Removal of the cell wall did not significantly increase antibiotic susceptibility of a resistant species. Protoplasts of Bacillus megaterium were insensitive to the antifungal agent, nystatin, and did not bind it to any detectable degree. Thus, the yeast or bacterial cell wall does not appear to play a major role in determining relative antibiotic susceptibility by masking internal sensitive target sites. A variety of antifungal antibiotics tested on the growth of log-phase yeast cells failed to produce osmotically fragile forms.

Bacteriol. 84:17-22. 1962.-A rapid microbiological assay procedure for the determination of thymine was devised. The test organism, Streptococcus faecalis Akt, a mutant of S. faecalis ATCC 8043, gives one-half the maximal growth response to 1.6 mug of thymine (assay range 0.5 to 2.5 mug) or to a molar equivalent (3.2 mug) of thymidine. Under these experimental conditions, 80 mug of 5-methylcytosine or 150 mug of thymidylic acid replace the thymine or thymidine requirement of the test organism. Addition of a mixture of adenine, guanine, and xanthine at a level of 40 mug/ml of each or higher to the basal medium, or addition of a mixture of deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at a level of 80 mug/ml of each or higher to the basal medium, inhibited the thymine or thymidine growth response of the organism. Thymine activities of rat and chick tissues were determined by this procedure. The data on the recovery of added thymine to tissues gave 84 to 103% recovery. Thymus, spleen, small intestine, and ventral prostate were higher in thymine activities as compared with other tissues.

TI  - Rearing of germfree and monocontaminated chicks in rigid plastic isolators.
AB  - A Plexiglas isolator for rearing germfree vertebrates is described. Plastic components were precut and finished by a Plexiglas supplier. This equipment is relatively inexpensive; moreover, neither special facilities nor skills are required in their construction. Advantages of this type of isolator are: readily dismantled for cleaning, durable, excellent visibility of the interior, and minimal maintenance. In 30 separate groups of animals, 27 of these yielded germfree chicks. Many of these chicks were reared germfree for 4 weeks; and several were maintained for about 2 months, without microbial contamination. Pure cultures of Candida albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium perfringens were established as monocontaminations in the intestinal tracts of chickens. In contrast, Alcaligenes faecalis ATCC 9220 failed to grow in the gut of chicks, following peroral administration of this organism. All chicks described were employed on other experiments, and were killed for various assays at times specified.

Bacteriol. 82:857-866. 1961.-Suitable conditions are described for the application of the Counter electronic particle counter to the study of bacterial number and particle size distribution in growing cultures. When Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were each grown in a different medium, exponential growth was accompanied by a continuous decrease in average particle size. The average apparent particle volume of S. faecalis decreased by about 50% in five generations. Microscopic studies of S. faecalis indicated that this was due to a decrease in the average chain length of the cultures. The following observations concerning average particle size during exponential growth of S. faecalis in a synthetic medium were made: (i) A decreased concentration of tryptophan, serine, or proline resulted in a significant decrease in average particle size. Similar changes in numerous other nutrients produced no or only minor changes. (ii) The addition of a cytoplasmic extract prepared from exponentially growing cells resulted in changes similar to those resulting from the partial withdrawal from the medium of certain nutrients. (iii) The effect of the cytoplasmic extract could be counteracted by the addition of tryptophan. (iv) A limited survey, including the effects of the rate of exponential growth, mechanical agitation, the presence of indoleacetic acid, indole, kinetin, lysozyme, or ascorbate, disclosed no additional factor which significantly influenced the particle size distribution.

The heat production of growing cultures gives a direct measure of the rate and amount of growth which has occurred. The enthalpy change when glucose is fermented essentially to lactic acid at 37 C is -29.1 cal per mmole of glucose, which is in agreement with the calculated value for the mixture of products formed.
