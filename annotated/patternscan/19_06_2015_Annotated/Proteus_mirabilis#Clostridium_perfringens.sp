TI  == [epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  == objective: acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (pb)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. this study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: this retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after pb in a series of 1,216 biopsies. bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. results: all patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before pb. bacterial  identification was possible in fourteen cases: e. coli (nine cases), proteus mirabilis (one case), klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), enterococcus faecalis (one case), staphylococcus spp (one case), clostridium perfringens (one case). only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). a high rate of resistance of e. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. however, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2gc and 3gc) and amikacin in 100% of cases. prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). conclusions: identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2gc or 3gc, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bact/alert 3d and bactec systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == investigation on the nutritive value and microbiological quality of wild quail carcasses.
AB  == quail meats have many advantages and superiority one the other species of poultry. this study was planned to throw plenty of light on gross chemical composition, lipid fractions, fatty acids composition, amino acids composition, of thigh and breast of male and female wild quail meat as well as the microbiological quality. the mean values of moisture, protein, fat, ash and energy contents ranged from 60.1 to 69.2%, 55.0 to 68.8%, 28.8 to 42.1%, 2.40 to  3.63% and 696 to 1000 kj, respectively. seven fractions of lipids (phospholipids, monoglycerides, cholesterol, diglycerides, free fatty acids, triglycerides and hydrocarbons) were estimated. the individual fatty acids were determined. the mean total unsaturated fatty acids represented 73.9, 66.8, 60.2 and 67.5% of the  total fatty acids in thigh male, breast male, thigh female and breast female quail, while that of saturated fatty acids were 25.1, 30.1, 32.0 and 30.4%, respectively. the essential fatty acids in thigh and breast males were 34.8 and 29.0% against 25.7 and 28.1% in females. amino acids composition were varied from 82.6 to 95.2 g/100 g protein in thigh, breast of male and female wild quails. the essential amino acids were illustrated. the mean values of psychotrophic, pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, streptococci and staph. aureus were 4 x 10(4), 1 x 10(2), 4 x 10(3), 3 x 10(3), 6 x 10(2) and 1 x 10(3) cfu/g, respectively. e. coli, enterobacter agglumerans, e. cloacae, morganella morgani,  proteus mirabilis, and p. vulgaris could be isolated in varying percentages. neither salmonellae nor clostridium perfringens could be isolated from the examined quails. the public health aspects for the estimated and isolated criteria were outlined.

TI  == the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded  by the plasmid pscs7 from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pscs7 from staphylococcus aureus, was determined. the structural cat gene encoded a protein of 209 amino acids, which represented one monomer of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). comparisons between the amino acid sequences of the pscs7-encoded cat from s. aureus and the previously sequenced cat variants from s. aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, staphylococcus haemolyticus, bacillus pumilis, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and proteus mirabilis were performed. an alignment of cat amino acid sequences demonstrated the presence of 34 conserved amino acids among all cat variants. these conserved residues were considered for their possible roles in the structure and function of cat. on the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic  tree was constructed. it demonstrated relatively large evolutionary distances between the cat variants of enteric bacteria, clostridium, bacillus, and staphylococcus species.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == [in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  == imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of  cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem  also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25  to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).

TI  == high resolution deuterium nmr studies of bacterial metabolism.
AB  == high resolution deuterium nmr spectra were obtained from suspensions of five bacterial strains: escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. deuterium-labeled d-glucose at c-1, c-2, and c-6 was used to monitor dynamically anaerobic metabolism. the flux of glucose through the various bacterial metabolic pathways  could be determined by following the disappearance of glucose and the appearance  of the major end products in the 2h nmr spectrum. the presence of both labeled and unlabeled metabolites could be detected using 1h nmr spectroscopy since the proton resonances in the labeled species are shifted upfield due to an isotopic chemical shift effect. the 1h-1h scalar coupling observed in both the 2h and 1h nmr spectra was used to assign definitively the resonances of labeled species. an increase in the intensity of natural abundance deuterium signal of water can be used to monitor pathways in which a deuteron is lost from the labeled metabolite. the steps in which label loss can occur are outlined, and the influence these processes have on the ability of 2h nmr spectroscopy to monitor metabolism are assessed.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease.
AB  == the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. two aerobic bacterial species, e. dispar and p. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, b. fragilis ss. fragilis, f. varium and two different strains of c. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. these strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the  patient. immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. in connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and  anaerobic bacterial isolates. antibodies belonging to igg and iga took part in the active immune response while igm was very little involved. antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. the importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with crohn's disease is discussed.

TI  == cutaneous abscesses. anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology and outpatient management.
AB  == specimens from 135 cutaneous abscesses in outpatients were cultured anaerobically and aerobically. of these, 4% were sterile and 29% yielded pure cultures, predominantly of staphylococcus aureus. aerobic species were isolated from all anatomic areas. anaerobes were found with a frequency comparable to aerobes in all nonperineal areas except the hand. in contrast, abscesses in the perineal region contained a greater variety and frequency of anaerobes. only two patients  were febrile. all abscesses were treated with incision and drainage, and all healed without complication, including those 74% that were treated without adjunctive antibiotics. primary management of cutaneous abscesses should be incision and drainage. in general, routine culture and antibiotic therapy are not indicated for localized abscesses in patients with presumably normal host defenses.

AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.

TI  == interactions of heteroaromatic compounds with nucleic acids. 2. influence of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of intercalating ligands.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a systematic study on the effects of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds interacting with dna by intercalation. all the compounds tested are derived from proflavine and acridine orange analogs with different heteroatoms in the middle ring. their base and sequence specificities were determined by differential dialysis of the ligand against dna samples of differing g-c content. the main results indicate that (a) the introduction of a phenyl substituent into  one of the two available positions of the middle ring increases or decreases the  g-c specificity of the ligand depending on the position where the substitution takes place; (b) compounds of the substitution type of neutral red (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethyl-amino-phenazine) show unexpectedly high g-c specificities and (c) dna ligands of pronounced sequence specificity for adjacent g-c pairs can be constructed by combining the structural elements of neutral red  with an additional phenyl residue in the same molecule. the further study of compounds related to the phenylated neutral red revealed that the g-c specificity can be improved or destroyed by additional substituents. the comparison of the g-c specificity and the dna-affinity data of the compounds studied leads to the suggestion that the specificity arises mainly from electronic factors which are strongly controlled through steric constraints on possible ocmplex geometries. as a basis for the discussion a possible structure for the dna complex of the phenylated neutral red is considered in which the extra phenyl ring at n-5 of the phenazinium system, protrudes into the large groove of the dna helix while the tricyclic part of the ligand is inserted between the dna base-pairs.

TI  == prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section.
AB  == using a random selection procedure, 100 patients were evaluated in order to determine the value of prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section. all patients were evaluated for febrile morbidity, and specific infection sites were recorded. significant differences were found between the treated and control groups and between cesarean sections performed prior to the onset of labor and after the onset of labor.

TI  == fractionation of dna on hydroxyapatite with a base-specific complexing agent.
AB  == we describe a chromatographic technique for separating mixtures of dna of varying g + c content. the method employs a specially prepared high-capacity hydroxyapatite and a g.c-specific dna ligand (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethylamino-5-phenyl-phenazinium cation, abbreviated pnr).  dna molecules rich in g.c pairs bind larger amounts of this dye and are eluted earlier from the hydroxyapatite column than are molecules rich in a.t pairs. the  dye can easily be removed from dna by dialysis or solvent extraction after the chromatographic separation. the resolution of the method approaches that of cscl  density gradient separation, and the capacity of the column is much larger than that of a typical density gradient experiment. elution of the dna is not dependent on molecular weight, so samples of different molecular weight can be separated on the basis of g + c content. the technique should be especially useful for separating g.c-rich minor components from dna obtained form eukaryotic cells, as demonstrated by a fraction of dna from calf thymus.
