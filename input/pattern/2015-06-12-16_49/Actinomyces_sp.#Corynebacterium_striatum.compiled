TI  - [Coryneform bacteria: their clinical significance and resistance patterns during  a three-year study].
AB  - We report data concerning our experience during three years (1998-2001) about isolation, identification and susceptibility towards antimicrobial agents of coryneform bacteria in infections of hospitalized/at risk patients. We isolated 54 Corynebacterium spp., with prevalence of C. striatum (8 strains) and C. amycolatum (7 strains), and 1 strain of Oerskovia spp. and 1 strain of Actinomyces neuii. 31 strains were isolated from the "exit-site" and 6 from peritoneal fluid of CAPD patients. Vancomycin and teicoplanin were always "in vitro" efficacious. Resistance rates towards other antibiotics were the following: 11% for minocycline, 12.5% for tetracycline, 20% for gentamicin and netilmicin, 61% for erythromycin and chloramphenicol, 66% for penicillin.
TI  - Evaluation of the RapID CB Plus system for identification of Corynebacterium species and other gram-positive rods.
AB  - Due to the difficulty of identifying Corynebacterium spp. with standard methods,  we compared them with the RapID CB Plus system (Remel, Lenexa, Kans. [formerly Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Norcross, Ga.]), which consists of 4 carbohydrate and 14 preformed enzyme tests, for the identification of 98 clinical isolates of Corynebacterium sp., other coryneforms, Listeria monocytogenes, and 17 ATCC strains. Forty (95%) of 42 strains of Corynebacterium spp. were accurately identified to the species level by the RapID CB Plus system, and two additional strains of C. striatum were identified with one additional conventional test for lipid requirement. Twenty-seven (75%) of the 36 coryneform strains tested were identified correctly to the species level. However, three of four strains of Brevibacterium sp. and all seven of the L. monocytogenes strains were identified to the genus level only. Actinomyces strains had variable results, and the one strain of Arcanobacterium haemolyticum tested was not identified. Overall, the RapID CB Plus system compared favorably with the conventional methods, was easy to inoculate and interpret, and is promising as a new method for identification of gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition as an adjunct to the identification of asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods.
AB  - Cellular fatty acid (CFA) compositions of 561 asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as an adjunct to their identification when grown on blood agar at 35 degrees C. The organisms could be divided into two groups. In the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform CDC groups A-3, A-4, and A-5; some strains of B-1 and B-3; "Corynebacterium aquaticum"; Brevibacterium liquefaciens; Rothia dentocariosa; and Listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (Ca15:0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (Ca17:0) acids. Other species with these types of CFA included B. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (Ci13:0) and anteisotridecanoic (Ca13:0) acids. CFAs useful for distinguishing among Jonesia denitrificans, Oerskovia spp., some strains of CDC groups B-1 and B-3, Kurthia spp., and Propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (C 16:0) acid, isopentadecanoic (Ci15:0) acid, and Ca15:0). The second group (straight-chained type), which included Actinomyces pyogenes; Arcanobacterium haemolyticum; C. bovis; C. cystitidis; C. diphtheriae; C. flavescens, "C. gentalium"; C. jeikeium; C. kutscheri; C. matruchotii; C .minutissimum; C. mycetoides; C. pilosum; C. pseudodiphtheriticum; "C. pseudogenitalium"; C. pseudotuberculosis; C. renale; CDC groups 1, 2, ANF-1, D-2, E, F-1, F-2, G-1, G-2, and I-2; C. striatum; "C. tuberculostearicum"; C. ulcerans; C. vitarumen; C. xerosis; and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, was typified by significant quantities of hexadecanoic (C16:0) and oleic acids (C18:cis9), with differences in the amounts of linoleic acid (C18:2), stearic acid (C18:0), an unnamed peak (equivalent chain length, 14.966), and small quantities of other known saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. CFA composition of these organisms was sufficiently discriminatory to assist in classification but could not be used as the sole means of identification.
