TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == [system analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
AB  == a perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, l. helveticus (strains of dsm), out of which, as known, drug hylak forte is made. our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. in the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of  the effects of vitamins b2, b6 and k on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. the results of the analysis allow us clarify  the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin b6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (fad, a derivative of vitamin b2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (nad, a derivative of vitamin b3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. the proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.

TI  == bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == [peptides with antihypertensive activity from milk and egg proteins].
AB  == antihypertensive hydrolysates and peptides have been isolated from food proteins. among them, there are of particular interest the antihypertensive casein hydrolysates, and some antihypertensive products obtained when milk was fermented by lactobacillus helveticus. the sequences val-pro-pro (vpp) and ile-pro-pro (ipp), with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory activity, have been isolated from these fermented products. selected enterococcus faecalis strains can also produce milk derived peptides with ace inhibitory and antihypertensive activities. the main of them is the sequence lhlplp. some studies also describe the production of antihypertensive hydrolysates and peptides from egg proteins. the sequences fradhpfl (ovokinin) and radhpfl (ovokinin 2-7), that have shown endothelium-dependent vasodilator activity, were obtained at first. some egg white hydrolysates with ace inhibitory activity have also been described. the idea of including the above-mentioned products as functional food ingredients is  particularly attractive. some of them have already proved their safety and effectiveness in hypertensive patients.

TI  == selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional mozzarella cheese.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 18a, lactobacillus helveticus 2b, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20f, streptococcus thermophilus 22c, enterococcus faecalis 32c and enterococcus durans 16e were the most acidifying strains within  146 isolates for natural whey starters. the effect of media and temperature on 2  autochthonous multiple strain cultures (amsi: 18a, 2b, 20f and 22c, 32c and 16e and amsii: 18a, 2b, 20f and 22c) was studied. genomic analysis showed a constant  cell numbers for amsii during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. mozzarella cheese was made by using amsii, commercial starter (cs) or citric acid (da). compared to other cheeses, the da had a lower level of protein, ash, ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, amsii cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. all the sensory attributes were scored highest for amsii cheese. asmii extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture mozzarella cheese.

TI  == biogenic amine-forming microbial communities in cheese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to screen two cheese starter cultures and cheese-borne  microbial communities with the potential to produce biogenic amines in cheese during ripening. bacteria of the genera enterococcus and lactobacillus and coliform bacteria were isolated from dutch-type semi-hard cheese at the beginning of the ripening period. statistically significant counts of bacterial isolates were screened for the presence of specific dna sequences coding for tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrdc) and histidine decarboxylase (hdc) enzymes. the pcr analysis of dna from 14 enterococcus and 3 lactobacillus isolates confirmed the presence of the targetted dna sequences. simultaneously, 13 tyrdc- and 3 hdc-positive isolates were grown in decarboxylase screening medium and this was followed by hplc analysis of the produced tyramine and histamine. conventional and molecular  taxonomic analyses of the above-mentioned isolates identified the following species: enterococcus durans (7 strains), enterococcus faecalis (3 strains), enterococcus faecium (1 strain), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), lactobacillus curvatus (1 strain), lactobacillus lactis (1 strain) and lactobacillus helveticus (1 strain). all of the above enterococcus and two of the lactobacillus strains originated from contaminating microbial communities. the l. helveticus strain, which was tyrosine decarboxylase-positive and exhibited tyramine production, originated from starter culture 1 used for cheese production. comparison of partial tyrdc sequences of positive enterococcus isolates revealed 89% sequence similarity, and that of hdc-positive lactobacillus isolates revealed 99% sequence similarity.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == new signaling molecules in some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a new family of putative signaling molecules having a 2(5h)-furanone configuration has been described in this work. they were released during late exponential or stationary phase in different growth media by some gram-positive bacteria, such as lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, enterococcus faecalis, and a gram-negative species, i.e. salmonella enterica. a pair of 2(5h)-furanones called furanones a and b occurred in all the conditioned media (cms) of the species considered. these two molecules showed similar retention times and their spectral data shared the key fragments to include them in the 2(5h)-furanones family. however, some differences were observed in the mass fragmentation profiles. in particular the use of pca analysis of all the mass fragments enabled the grouping of furanone a profiles of s. enterica, l. helveticus, l. plantarum, l. paraplantarum, l. sanfranciscensis and e. faecalis in one unique cluster with only few exceptions. on the other hand, the mass fragmentation profiles of furanone b of the major part of the species and strains could be grouped together and were differentiated from those of l. helveticus. the specific activity of cell-free supernatants of high density cultures of s. enterica confirmed that the release of active molecules, and specifically of furanones a and b, was cell density dependent. moreover, a preliminary experiment suspending s. enterica cells into cell-free supernatants of l. helveticus previously exposed to an oxidative stress demonstrated that furanones a and b have a strong interspecific activity. in fact cell autolysis and cell envelope damages were observed with scanning electron microscopy (sem) in s. enterica.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == a novel bacillus natto plasmid pls32 capable of replication in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == plasmid pls32 is a relatively large (approximately 70 kbp), cryptic, low copy-number plasmid present in bacillus natto. we isolated and analyzed the replication region of the plasmid in b. subtilis, and the following results were  obtained: the replication region contained an open reading frame encoding a 287-amino acid protein (repn), whose amino acid sequence was partially homologous with those of the rep proteins encoded on plasmids pad1 and plj1 isolated from enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus helveticus, respectively; the replication origin (orin) was located in the repn-coding region; the copy number of a pls32 derivative, pbet131, was 2 to 3 per chromosome; replication of pbet131 required poll. these features show that pls32 is a novel plasmid capable of replication in b. subtilis.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial flora of sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == the microflora of a sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. the dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5)  cfu g-1. the spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum and lact. reuteri. the total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the ph dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. in this phase, only the latter two species remained dominant  in a ratio of 1:1. from the sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. sequence comparison of partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. five strains were classified as lact. vaginalis and could be regarded  as heterogeneous biovars of this species. the other two strains could be assigned to lact. helveticus. rapd-pcr and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.

TI  == sequence and analysis of the replication region of the staphylococcus xylosus plasmid psx267.
AB  == the region of the 29.5-kb plasmid psx267 from staphylococcus xylosus dsm 20267 that is required for autonomous replication in staphylococci was isolated on a 1.8-kb dna fragment. the sequence analysis of the fragment yielded two open reading frames, repa and orf2, encoding proteins of 37.2 and 13.2 kda, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequence of repa showed similarity to the replication initiator protein of plasmid pad1 from enterococcus faecalis, to two  proteins of unknown function encoded by the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10 and the lactobacillus helveticus plasmid plj1, and surprisingly to the mouse interferon-response element binding factor 1. the repa gene of psx267 is indispensable for replication suggesting that it encodes the replication initiator protein of psx267. introduction of a frameshift mutation into repa or deletion of 26 codons at its 3'-end resulted in nonreplicative plasmids. removal  of sequences required for repa expression also abolished replication. complementation experiments with repa in trans identified the ori of psx267 within the repa coding region. the second orf, which is located downstream of repa, could be deleted without affecting plasmid replication. it seems to be a nonfunctional remainder of a rolling circle plasmid of the pc194/pub110 family, since its deduced amino acid sequence resembles the pc194/pub110-type replication proteins. the minimal replicon of psx267 defined so far comprises 1255 bp. besides repa, no other plasmid-encoded gene is required to mediate replication in staphylococci.

AB  == differences in species composition, number and level of antagonistic activity of  bacteria isolated from the digestive tract of chernobyl female minks of various age and with different immunological state have been established. prevalence of anaerobes (bifidobacteria) and microaerophils (lactic acid bacteria) with the increase of microorganisms concentration along the channel: stomach, small and large intestine (10(7)-10(10)/g) was found in all the departments of digestive tract of minks. among the identified lactic-acid bacteria lactobacillus helveticus (10(7)-10(8)/g) prevailed in the stomach of the studied female minks,  l. coryniformis (10(9)-10(10)/g) in the small intestine, l. casei (10(10)/g) in the large one. antagonistic activity was most expressed in the strains of l. helveticus and l. casei, isolated from the younger (1.5 year-old) minks. enterococcus faecalis isolated from the stomach of 1.5 year-old female minks was  distinguished by the greatest antagonistic activity among identified enterococci. strains of e. faecium isolated from the thin intestine of the young female minks  (1.5 year-old) and from the large intestine of more nature animals (2.5 years) who received thymogen were characterized by the most expressed antibiosis among enterococci isolated bacteria a conclusion was made that the mechanisms of inhibitory effect of the studied microorganisms are underlied by not only their capacity to form organic acids but also by the capacity to produce antibiotic products.

TI  == kinetic studies of the action of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii that forms poration complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  == the bacteriocin lactacin f is bactericidal against lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, and enterococcus faecalis. activity against l. delbrueckii was recently shown to be dependent on two peptides, lafa and lafx, which are encoded within the lactacin f operon (t. r. klaenhammer, fems microbiol. rev. 12:39-87, 1993). it has been proposed that two peptides form an active lactacin f complex. in this study, the action of lactacin f against e. faecalis atcc 19443 and the effects of various environmental parameters were investigated in detail. addition of lactacin f induced the loss of k+ from cells  of l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus johnsonii 88-4, and e. faecalis, while the lactacin f producer l. johnsonii vpi 11088 was not affected by the bacteriocin. lactacin f caused an immediate loss of cellular k+, depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, and hydrolysis of internal atp in e. faecalis. lactacin f induced loss of k+ in 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-treated cells, indicating that pores are formed in the absence of a proton motive force. atp hydrolysis was not due to dissipation of the proton motive force but was most likely caused by efflux of inorganic phosphate, resulting in a shift of the atp hydrolysis equilibrium. action of lactacin f was optimal at acidic ph values and  was reduced in the presence of di- and trivalent cations. the lanthanide gadolinium (gd3+) prevented action of lactacin f completely at a concentration of 0.2 mm. lactacin f-induced loss of cell k+ was severely reduced at low temperatures, presumably as a result of increased ordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the cytoplasmic membrane.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == transformation of lactobacillus helveticus subsp. jugurti with plasmid plhr by electroporation.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus subsp. jugurti was transformed with plasmid, plhr (8.5 kilobases), by electroporation. the plasmid, plhr, consists of a cryptic plasmid, plj1, from l. helveticus subsp. jugurti, the escherichia coli vector pbr329, and  the erythromycin resistance gene of pam beta 1 from enterococcus faecalis. maximum transformation efficiency of 1.3 x 10(4) transformants per microgram of dna was obtained by exposure to a pulse with an exponential decay waveform at 4 kv/cm with 25 microf capacitance. the presence of glycine in the growth medium was essential for transformation. plasmid dna isolated from transformants had not undergone detectable rearrangements or deletions. in addition, it was found that  l. helveticus subsp. jugurti has a restriction and modification system.

TI  == evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pip501 into strains of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == the conjugative broad host range plasmid pip501 was transferred from streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. with these transconjugants as donors the  plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of strep. thermophilus. there was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of lact. helveticus. transfer from lact. helveticus to strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. there was no evidence for the conjugal transfer  of plasmid pip501 into a strain of lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either  lactic streptococci or lactobacillus sp.
