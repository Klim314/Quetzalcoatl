[assessment of antagonistic activity in vitro lactobacillus spp. strains againts  clostridum difficile strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of patients hospitalized in three hospitals in region mazovia].
introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of  lactobacillus strains against clinical c. difficile strains isolated from faecal samples of adults patients with diarrhea. a total 61 strains of c. difficile randomly selected isolated in the period 2007-2008 from the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients in three hospitals province mazovia, poland. to determination of antagonistic activity ofprobiotic lactobacillus spp. strains used four reference strains: lactobacillus plantarum 2017405, lactobacillus fermentum 353, lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 21007 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. methods: isolation of c. difficile was performed on selective columbia agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxitine and amphothericin b (clo medium, biomerieux, france). the plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37 degrees c. isolates were identified as c. difficile by the characteristic morphology of the colonies and horse-like odour, green yellow fluorescence under uv. toxigenicity of of c. difficile strains was determined in pcr to detection of fragments of genes encoding toxin a (tcda), toxin b (tcdb) and binary toxin (cdta and cdtb). the study of antagonistic activity four lactobacillus spp. strains against 61 clinical c. difficile strains was performed according to standard methods. lactobacillus strains were inoculated on mrs medium and incubated in oxygen-free atmosphere and cut the bars of mrs agar and applied to the plate with cultures of c. difficile strains. results: assessment of antagonist activity of lactobacillus spp. strains was performed by measuring the zone of inhibition of grown of c. difficile strains. the study shows that of probiotic lactobacillus spp. strains interacted antagonistically in vitro against all toxigenic (a+b+cdt- and a+b+cdt+) of c. difficile strains. conclusions: the differences in the antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. strains against different toxigenic clinical c. difficile strains were not observed.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
