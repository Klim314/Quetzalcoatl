TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Plantaricin IIA-1A5 from Lactobacillus plantarum IIA-1A5 displays bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Plantaricin IIA-1A5 is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum IIA-1A5  isolated from Indonesian beef. This research aimed to identify the genes involved in plantaricin IIA-1A5 production and examine its mode of action against Staphylococcus aureus. It has been reported that a bacteriocin structural gene, plnW, is present in genome of L. plantarum IIA-1A5. Here, we reported the presence of additional genes responsible for plantaricin precursor (plnA and plnEF) and a gene encoding the quorum sensor of histidine kinase (plnB). It indicates that genes involved in production of plantaricin IIA-1A5 are organized in at least two bacteriocin operons (plnABCD, plnEFI) and a structural plnW gene. Purified plantaricin IIA-1A5 yielded a single band in SDS-PAGE with apparent size of 6.4 kDa. Amino acid composition of purified plantaricin IIA-1A5 was mainly composed of cationic glutamic acid and cysteine that allowed the formation of disulphide bonds, suggesting plantaricin IIA-1A5 belongs to the pediocin-subclass of class II bacteriocins. Plantaricin IIA-1A5 displayed remarkable antibacterial activity against S. aureus, which was initiated by the adsorption of plantaricin IIA-1A5 onto the cell membrane of S. aureus. The adsorption is hypothesised to be facilitated by non-ionic interactions as it is reduced by the presence of organic solvents or detergents. This adsorption promoted leakage of cellular metabolites through the cell membrane of S. aureus, as indicated by the release of genetic and proteinaceous material of S. aureus observed at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. The leakage also promoted the release of divalent (Ca(2+), Mg(2+)) and monovalent (K(+)) cations. The release of these intracellular components might be due to pores formed in the cell membrane of S. aureus by plantaricin IIA-1A5 as shown by scanning electron microscopy. Altogether, the mode of action of plantaricin IIA-1A5 against S. aureus seems to be bactericidal as indicated by lysis of the cell membrane.
TI  - Cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. Combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. METHODS: Probiotic cultures were inoculated into MRS broth adjusted to pH 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Survivors of pH 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh MRS broth and incubated at 55 degrees C for 2 h. The cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. The adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. The combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. Viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium longum LMG 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. However, for B. longum Bb46 and B. bifidum LMG 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. A cocktail containing L. plantarum + B. longum Bb46 + B. longum LMG 13197 best inhibited S. aureus while E. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing L. acidophilus La14 150B + B. longum Bb46 + B. bifidum LMG 11041. A cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. CONCLUSION: Multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - [Comparison of expression and antibacterial activities of recombinant porcine lactoferrin expressed in four Lactobacillus species].
AB  - The coding sequence for the mature peptide of porcine lactoferrin (Plf) was synthesized according to the codon usage of lactobacillus, to establish optimized porcine lactoferrin Lactobacillus expression system. The gene was ligated into the Xho I/BamH I site of Lactobacillus expression vector pPG612.1 and the recombinant plasmid pPG612.1-plf was transformed individually into Lactobacillus casei ATCC393, Lactobacillus pentosus KLDS1.0413, Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS1.0344 or Lactobacillus paracasei KLDS1.0652 by electroporation. After induction with xylose, expression of the recombinant proteins was detected by Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Secretion of recombinant Plf proteins from four recombinant species was determined quantitatively by ELISA. The antibacterial activities of recombinant proteins were measured by agar diffusion method. The result shows that Plf was correctly expressed in four species of recombinant lactobacillus, with molecular weight of about 73 kDa. The expression levels in recombinant Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei were 9.6 mug/mL, 10.8 mug/mL, 12.5 mug/mL and 9.9 mug/mL, respectively. Antimicrobial activity experiment shows that the recombinant proteins were active against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria, Pasteurella. The recombinant Plf expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum showed the best antibacterial activity among all recombinant lactobacillus species. These data represent a basis for the development and application of porcine lactoferrin from recombinant lactobacillus.
TI  - Differential profiles of gastrointestinal proteins interacting with peptidoglycans from Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria that contributes to the regulation of host immunity in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Although Gram-positive bacteria contain structurally distinct PGNs that are considered to differently interact with the GIT, PGN-binding proteins (PGN-BPs) in the GIT have been poorly understood. In the present study, we purified PGNs from Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus (named as Lp.PGN and Sa.PGN, respectively) and identified Lp.PGN-BPs and Sa.PGN-BPs in the lysate of mouse GIT. Lp.PGN activated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and NOD2, whereas Sa.PGN activated NOD2, but not NOD1, implying that both PGNs retained the biological activity and were differently recognized by the host cells. PGN-BPs were isolated by precipitation with Lp.PGN or Sa.PGN and identified using LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid Fourier transform mass spectrometry. Three independent experiments demonstrated that 18 Lp.PGN-BPs and 6 Sa.PGN-BPs were reproducibly obtained with statistical significance (P<0.05). Both Lp.PGN and Sa.PGN bound to proteins which are related to cytoskeleton, microbial adhesion, and mucosal integrity. Lp.PGN selectively bound to proteins related to gene expression, chaperone, and antimicrobial function. However, Sa.PGN preferentially interacted with proteins involved in adherence and invasion of pathogens. Collectively, these results suggest that bacterial PGNs interact with the proteins regulating mucosal homeostasis and immunity in the gut and PGNs of commensals and pathogens might be also differentially recognized in the GIT.
TI  - Characterization and bioactivities of an exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus plantarum YW32.
AB  - The exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus plantarum YW32 was purified and characterized, and the in vitro bioactivities of the purified EPS were also evaluated. The EPS had a molecular weight of 1.03x10(5) Da, and it consisted of mannose, fructose, galactose and glucose in an approximate molar ratio of 8.2:1:4.1:4.2. Microstructural studies of the EPS demonstrated a web-like structure composed of compact ropes, and presence of many homogeneous rod-shaped lumps. The EPS also showed high thermal stability with a degradation temperature of 283.5 degrees C. Furthermore, the EPS at a dose of 5mg/ml had strong scavenging abilities toward hydroxyl (77.5%) and superoxide radicals (66.5%). The EPS exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the formation of biofilms by several pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli O157, Shigella flexneri CMCC (B), Staphylococcus aureus AC1 and Salmonella typhimurium S50333. In vitro antitumor assay of the EPS showed that it had good inhibitory activity against colon cancer HT-29 cells. These characteristics and bioactivities of the EPS would make it a promising candidate for use as a potential food adjunct in foods with healthy properties.
TI  - Characterization of Bacteriocin like inhibitory substance produced by a new Strain Brevibacillus borstelensis AG1 Isolated from 'Marcha'.
AB  - In the present study, a bacterium isolated from Marcha- a herbal cake used as traditional starter culture to ferment local wine in North East India, was evaluated for bacteriocin like inhibitory substance production and was tested against six food borne/spoilage causing pathogens viz. Listeria monocytogenes MTCC 839, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 121, Clostridium perfringens MTCC 450, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides MTCC 107 by using bit/disc method followed by well diffusion method. The bacterial isolate was identified as Brevibacillus borstelensis on the basis of phenotypic, biochemical and molecular characteristics using 16Sr RNA gene technique. Bacteriocin like inhibitory substance produced by Brevibacillus borstelensis AG1 was purified by gel exclusion chromatography. The molecular mass of the Brevibacillus borstelensis AG1 was found to be 12 kDa. Purified bacteriocin like inhibitory substance of Brevibacillus borstelensis was further characterized by studying the effect of temperature, pH, proteolytic enzyme and stability. Bacteriocin like inhibitory substance was found to be thermostable upto 100 degrees C, active at neutral pH, sensitive to trypsin, and partially stable till third week of storage thus showing a bright prospective to be used as a potential food biopreservative.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of gold-supported cerium oxide nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2) have been shown to be a novel therapeutic in many biomedical applications. Gold (Au) nanoparticles have also attracted widespread interest due to their chemical stability and unique optical properties. Thus, decorating Au on CeO2 nanoparticles would have potential for exploitation in the biomedical field. METHODS: In the present work, CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized by a chemical combustion method were supported with 3.5% Au (Au/CeO2) by a deposition-precipitation method. The as-synthesized Au, CeO2, and Au/CeO2 nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 normal cells and A549 lung cancer cells. RESULTS: The as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible measurements. The X-ray diffraction study confirmed the formation of cubic fluorite-structured CeO2 nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm. All synthesized nanoparticles were nontoxic towards RAW 264.7 cells at doses of 0-1,000 muM except for Au at >100 muM. For A549 cancer cells, Au/CeO2 had the highest inhibitory effect, followed by both Au and CeO2 which showed a similar effect at 500 and 1,000 muM. Initial binding of nanoparticles occurred through localized positively charged sites in A549 cells as shown by a shift in zeta potential from positive to negative after 24 hours of incubation. A dose-dependent elevation in reactive oxygen species indicated that the pro-oxidant activity of the nanoparticles was responsible for their cytotoxicity towards A549 cells. In addition, cellular uptake seen on transmission electron microscopic images indicated predominant localization of nanoparticles in the cytoplasmic matrix and mitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress. With regard to antibacterial activity, both types of nanoparticles had the strongest inhibitory effect on Bacillus subtilis in monoculture systems, followed by Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, while, in coculture tests with Lactobacillus plantarum, S. aureus was inhibited to a greater extent than the other bacteria. CONCLUSION: Gold-supported CeO2 nanoparticles may be a potential nanomaterial for in vivo application owing to their biocompatible and antibacterial properties.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by crude and fractionated extract from lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Increasing levels of antibiotic resistance by Staphylococcus aureus have posed a  need to search for non-antibiotic alternatives. This study aimed to assess the inhibitory effects of crude and fractionated cell-free supernatants (CFS) of locally isolated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) against a clinical strain of S. aureus. A total of 42 LAB strains were isolated and identified from fresh vegetables, fresh fruits and fermented products prior to evaluation of inhibitory activities. CFS of LAB strains exhibiting a stronger inhibitive effect against S. aureus were fractionated into crude protein, polysaccharide and lipid fractions. Crude protein fractions showed greater inhibition against S. aureus compared to polysaccharide and lipid fractions, with a more prevalent effect from Lactobacillus plantarum 8513 and L. plantarum BT8513. Crude protein, polysaccharide and lipid fractions were also characterised with glycine, mannose and oleic acid being detected as the major component of each fraction, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy revealed roughed and wrinkled membrane morphology of S. aureus upon treatment with crude protein fractions of LAB, suggesting an inhibitory effect via the destruction of cellular membrane. This research illustrated the potential application of fractionated extracts from LAB to inhibit S. aureus for use in the food and health industry.
TI  - Short communication: Development of a direct in vivo screening model to identify  potential probiotic bacteria using Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is an accepted model host to study host-bacteria interactions in the gut, in addition to being a simple model with which to study conserved aspects of biological signaling pathways in intestinal environments, because these nematode worms have similar intestinal cells to those of humans. Here, we used C. elegans to develop a new in vivo screening system for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Initially, critical colonization ability of LAB strains isolated from Korean infant feces was screened in the worm intestinal tract over a period of 5 d. Furthermore, we investigated host health-promoting activities, including longevity-extending effects and immune-enhancing activities against foodborne pathogen infection. We identified 4 LAB strains that were highly persistent in the nematode gut and that significantly prolonged the longevity of C. elegans and improved the survival of C. elegans in response to infection by Staphylococcus aureus. The 4 LAB strains we identified showed resistance to acid and bile conditions, assimilated cholesterol, and were able to attach to a mucus layer. The 4 LAB isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Taken together, we developed a direct in vivo screening system using C. elegans to study host health-promoting LAB. Our system is simple, rapid, cost-effective, and reliable, and we anticipate that this system will result in the discovery of many more potential probiotic bacteria for dairy foods.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Plantaricin ZJ5, a new bacteriocin produced  by Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ5.
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the antimicrobial potential of Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ5, a strain isolated from fermented mustard with a broad range of inhibitory activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Here we present the peptide plantaricin ZJ5 (PZJ5), which is an extreme pH and heat-stable. However, it can be digested by pepsin and proteinase K. This peptide has strong activity against Staphylococcus aureus. PZJ5 has been purified using a multi-step process, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interactions and reverse-phase chromatography. The molecular mass of the peptide was found to be 2572.9 Da using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The primary structure of this peptide was determined using amino acid sequencing and DNA sequencing, and these analyses revealed that the DNA sequence translated as a 44-residue precursor containing a 22-amino-acid N-terminal extension that was of the double-glycine type. The bacteriocin sequence exhibited no homology with known bacteriocins when compared with those available in the database, indicating that it was a new class IId bacteriocin. PZJ5 from a food-borne strain may be useful as a promising probiotic candidate.
TI  - Screening of Lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H(2)O(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Purification and characterisation of plantaricin ZJ008, a novel bacteriocin against Staphylococcus spp. from Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ008.
AB  - A novel bacteriocin, plantaricin ZJ008 produced by Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ008  isolated from fresh milk, was purified by XAD 2, cation exchange chromatograph, gel chromatograph, and RP-HPLC. Mass spectrometry based on MALDI-TOF indicated that the bacteriocin had a molecular of 1334.77 Da. Only five of twenty amino acids could be identified by Edman degradation. This bacteriocin was highly thermostable (121 degrees C, 30 min) and exhibited narrow pH stability (pH 4.0-5.0). It was sensitive to alpha-Chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and pepsin. However it still had 80% of activity after treatment by proteinase K. The action mode of this peptide functioned as bactericidal, but it did not lead to lysis of cells. This bacteriocin exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially Staphylococcus spp. These results suggested that this bacteriocin appears potentially very useful to control and inhibit Staphylococcus spp. in the food industry.
TI  - Evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  - The suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. A variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteriditis, Candida tropicalis or Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and CO2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (Don Whitely R.A.B.I.T.) system. The majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced a detectable growth signal. The linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (R(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. Specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. This initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.
TI  - Probiotic assessment of Enterococcus durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  - Forty-five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16S rDNA genes. Among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low pH, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. Lactococcus lactis 2HL, Enterococcus durans 6HL, Lactobacillus acidophilus 36YL and Lactobacillus plantarum 5BL showed the best resistance to these conditions. These strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Lactococcus lactis 2HL and E. durans 6HL were the most adherent strains. In vitro tests under neutralized pH proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. Results revealed that the growth of Escherichia coli O26, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella flexneri was suppressed by both LAB strains. The antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. These data suggest that E. durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed as new probiotics.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid from Lactobacillus plantarum inhibits the expression of platelet-activating factor receptor induced by Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in human monocyte-like cells.
AB  - Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) plays an important role in bacterial infection and inflammation. We examined the effect of the bacterial cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Lactobacillus plantarum (pLTA) and Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) on PAFR expression in THP-1, a monocyte-like cell line. LPS and aLTA, but not pLTA, significantly increased PAFR expression, whereas priming with pLTA inhibited LPSmediated or aLTA-mediated PAFR expression. Expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4, and CD14 increased with LPS and aLTA treatments, but was inhibited by pLTA pretreatment. Neutralizing antibodies against TLR2, TLR4, and CD14 showed that these receptors were important in LPS-mediated or aLTA-mediated PAFR expression. PAFR expression is mainly regulated by the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Blocking PAF binding to PAFR using a PAFR inhibitor indicated that LPS-mediated or aLTA-mediated PAF expression affected TNF-alpha production. In the mouse small intestine, pLTA inhibited PAFR, TLR2, and TLR4 expression that was induced by heat-labile toxin. Our data suggested that pLTA has an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of PAFR that was induced by pathogenic ligands.
TI  - Interaction of antimicrobial peptide Plantaricin149a and four analogs with lipid  bilayers and bacterial membranes.
AB  - The amidated analog of Plantaricin149, an antimicrobial peptide from Lactobacillus plantarum NRIC 149, directly interacts with negatively charged liposomes and bacterial membranes, leading to their lysis. In this study, four Pln149-analogs were synthesized with different hydrophobic groups at their N-terminus with the goal of evaluating the effect of the modifications at this region in the peptide's antimicrobial properties. The interaction of these peptides with membrane models, surface activity, their hemolytic effect on red blood cells, and antibacterial activity against microorganisms were evaluated. The analogs presented similar action of Plantaricin149a; three of them with no hemolytic effect (< 5%) until 0.5 mM, in addition to the induction of a helical element when binding to negative liposomes. The N-terminus difference between the analogs and Plantaricin149a retained the antibacterial effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa for all peptides (MIC50 of 19 muM and 155 muM to Plantaricin149a, respectively) but resulted in a different mechanism of action against the microorganisms, that was bactericidal for Plantaricin149a and bacteriostatic for the analogs. This difference was confirmed by a reduction in leakage action for the analogs. The lytic activity of Plantaricin149a is suggested to be a result of the peptide-lipid interactions from the amphipathic helix and the hydrophobic residues at the N-terminus of the antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Probiotic Potential of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1 Isolated from Batter of Dosa,  a South Indian Fermented Food.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum LD1 was isolated from dosa batter and identified by biochemical, physiological and genetic methods. Species level identification was done by 16S rDNA amplification and sequencing. The probiotic potential of strain LD1 was assessed by different standard parameters. Cell surface hydrophobicity was recorded to be 62 % with SAT value <0.007 M. Seventy-eight percent of viable count was found after treatment with simulated gastric juice containing pepsin (pH 2.0). Bile salt tolerance and bile salt hydrolase activity were also demonstrated by strain LD1. The culture supernatant was able to inhibit food-borne as well as clinical pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, urogenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio sp. Strain LD1 was found to be sensitive to most of the antibiotics used in the study. Since strain has been isolated from food source that is most typical of Southern India, it would be safe for further consumption in probiotic products.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - High-level expression, purification and characterisation of porcine beta-defensin 2 in Pichia pastoris and its potential as a cost-efficient growth promoter in porcine feed.
AB  - Porcine beta-defensin 2 (pBD2), a recently discovered porcine defensin that is produced by the intestine, exerts antimicrobial activities and innate immune effects that are linked to intestinal diseases in pigs. Here, we report a codon-optimised protein corresponding to mature pBD2 cDNA that was expressed and purified in Pichia pastoris yeast. The highest amount of secreted protein (3,694.0 mg/L) was reached 144 h into a 150-h induction during high-density cultivation. Precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography yielded 383.7 mg/L purified recombinant pBD2 (rpBD2) with a purity of ~93.7 %. Two recombinant proteins of 5,458.5 and 5,258.4 Da were detected in the mass spectrum due to variation in the amino-terminus. The rpBD2 exhibited high antimicrobial activity against a broad range of pig pathogenic bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] 32-128 mug/mL); the highest activity was observed against Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis (MIC 32-64 mug/mL). However, rpBD2 also inhibited the growth of probiotics such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but at lower efficacies than the pathogens. Purified or unpurified rpBD2 also maintained high activity over a wide range of pH values (2.0-10.0), a high thermal stability at 100 degrees C for 40 min and significant resistance to papain, pepsin and trypsin. In addition, the activity of rpBD2 towards S. aureus was unaffected by 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20 % dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). Our results suggest that pBD2 could be produced efficiently in large quantities in P. pastoris and be a substitute for traditional antibiotics for growth promotion in the porcine industry.
TI  - Differential effects of low and high doses of lipoteichoic acid on lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 production.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is increased in patients who are suffering from septic shock, is an important mediator of the inflammatory response. Here, we examined the priming effect of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on IL-6 production in a monocyte-like cell line. METHODS: THP-1 cells were primed by treatingwith a low or high dose of LTA isolated from Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) and then re-treated with LPS. IL-6 production, receptor expression, and the variation of signaling molecules were examined by ELISA, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: LPS-mediated IL-6 production was dramatically increased in THP-1 cells pretreated with a low dose aLTA, while it was significantly decreased when a high dose of aLTA was given along with LPS. LPS-induced IL-6 production in low dose aLTA priming cells mediated by NF-kappaB and MAPKs pathways, and Akt functioned as a negative regulator of IL-6 production. Together, the results of this study suggest that different doses of bacterial cell surface components can mediate a diverse range of responses with respect to inflammatory cytokine production.
TI  - Lactobacilli reduce chemokine IL-8 production in response to TNF-alpha and Salmonella challenge of Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The probiotic properties of two selected lactobacilli strains were assessed. L. salivarius and L. plantarum displayed higher hydrophobicity (48% and 54%, resp.) and coaggregation ability with four pathogens (from 7.9% to 57.5%). L. salivarius and L. plantarum had good inhibitory effects on S. aureus (38.2% and 49.5%, resp.) attachment to Caco-2 cells. Live lactobacilli strains and their conditioned media effectively inhibited IL-8 production (<14.6 pg/mL) in TNF-alpha-induced Caco-2 cells. Antibiotic-treated and the sonicated lactobacilli also maintained inhibitory effects (IL-8 production from 5.0 to 36.3 pg/mL); however, the heat-treated lactobacilli lost their inhibitory effects (IL-8 production from 130.2 to 161.0 pg/mL). These results suggest that both the structural components and the soluble cellular content of lactobacilli have anti-inflammatory effects. We also found that pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with lactobacilli inhibited S. typhimurium-induced IL-8 production (<27.3 pg/mL). However, lactobacilli did not inhibit IL-8 production in Caco-2 cells pretreated with S. typhimurium. These results suggest that the tested lactobacilli strains are appropriate for preventing inflammatory diseases caused by enteric pathogens but not for therapy. In short, L. salivarius and L. plantarum are potential candidates for the development of microbial ecological agents and functional foods.
TI  - Human pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses in Drosophila: disease modeling, lessons, and shortcomings.
AB  - Drosophila has been the invertebrate model organism of choice for the study of innate immune responses during the past few decades. Many Drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. Here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. We discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. Prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. Immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates validation in mammalian models of infection.
TI  - Potential probiotic attributes and antagonistic activity of an indigenous isolate Lactobacillus plantarum DM5 from an ethnic fermented beverage "Marcha" of north eastern Himalayas.
AB  - A novel isolate DM5 identified as Lactobacillus plantarum displayed in vitro probiotic properties as well as antimicrobial activity. It showed adequate level of survival to the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and survived low acidic pH 2.5 for 5 h. Artificial gastric juice and intestinal fluidic environment decreased the initial viable cell population of isolate DM5 only by 7% and 13%, respectively, while lysozyme (200 microg/ml) and bile salt (0.5%) enhanced its growth. It was found to deconjugate taurodeoxycholic acid, indicating its potential to reduce hypercholesterolemia. Isolate DM5 demonstrated cell surface hydrophobicity of 53% and autoaggregation of 54% which are the prerequisite for adhesion to epithelial cells and colonization to host. Bacteriocin activity of isolate was found to be 6400 AU/ml as it inhibited the growth of food borne pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Alcaligenes faecalis. The bactericidal action of bacteriocin from isolate was analyzed by flow cytometry, rendering its use as prospective probiotic and starter culture in food industry.
TI  - Evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by Lactobacillus plantarum CFR 2194.
AB  - The study details the investigations on the ability of Lactobacillus plantarum CFR 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. Surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. Isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. Critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). The emulsification index (EI), emulsification activity (EA), and emulsion stability (ES) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. Aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: Escherichia coli ATCC 31705, E. coli MTCC 108, Salmonella typhi, Yersinia enterocolitica MTCC 859, and Staphylococcus aureus F 722. More importantly, the biosurfactant from L. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. The results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus mutans interacts with Toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. Although lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is considered a major virulence factor of Gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to S. mutans LTA. In this study, we purified LTA from S. mutans (Sm.LTA) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. The Sm.LTA preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. Upon exposure to Sm.LTA, the murine macrophage cell-line RAW 264.7 cells produced TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner. Sm.LTA preferentially bound to and activated CHO/CD14/TLR2 cells rather than CHO/CD14/TLR4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing CD14 and TLR2 or CD14 and TLR4, respectively. Sm.LTA could not induce TNF-alpha or NO production in macrophages derived from TLR2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. TLR2-dependent induction of NO by Sm.LTA was also confirmed in RAW 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking TLR2. Furthermore, Sm.LTA deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated TLR2 nor induced TNF-alpha or NO production, suggesting that Sm.LTA lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of Sm.LTA. Unlike Staphylococcus aureus LTA, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, Sm.LTA showed a modest induction of NO production comparable to LTAs of other oral bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus plantarum. In conclusion, our results suggest that the Sm.LTA interacts with TLR2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by Lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
AB  - Cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by Lactobacillus plantarum CECT-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. The main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (PLA) and lactic acid (LA). The production of PLA by L. plantarum CECT-221 was evaluated in the Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or PPA. Using 30.5 mM PPA, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of PLA producing 16.4 mM PLA in 46 h. A concentration of 40 mM PPA was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. The biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of PPA; the average productivity of PLA increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mM after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mM mM(-1); meanwhile, LA reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g L(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). Cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with Carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), Listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and Salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). Additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that L. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. This is the first report of PLA production from cheese whey and PPA. The extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
TI  - Strain-specific probiotics properties of Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis isolates from Brazilian food products.
AB  - A total of 234 LAB isolates from Brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at pH 2.0. Fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. They were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-PCR and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (10) and Lactobacillus brevis (7). Based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one L. fermentum (CH58), three L. plantarum (CH3, CH41 and SAU96) and two L. brevis (SAU105 and FFC199) were selected. The highest co-aggregation ability with Escherichia coli was observed to L. plantarum CH41. L. brevis SAU105 and FFC199 and L. fermentum CH58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 and L. brevis FFC199 showed adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (1.5%). They were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). The present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the isolates L. plantarum CH3 and CH41 (cocoa) and L. brevis FFC199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.
TI  - Characterization of Oaxaca raw milk cheese microbiota with particular interest in Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify and characterize lactobacilli strains from Mexican Oaxaca cheese. Twenty-seven lactobacilli isolated from Oaxaca cheese were identified at species level by 16S rRNA sequencing. Selected isolates were further characterized by ribotyping. Isolates were screened, among others, by acidifying capacity, antibiotic resistance, and activity against pathogens. Lactobacillus plantarum was predominant in Oaxaca cheese. The intraspecies variability of Lb. plantarum isolates was great. Multiple antibiotic resistances were observed. Eight isolates showed antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic species tested. Four Lb. plantarum strains showing low antibiotic resistance index, antimicrobial activity against enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua stains, amine-negative decarboxylase activity, and resistance to NaCl and bile salt solutions, could be preselected to complete studies focused on designing a culture for use in pasteurized-milk Oaxaca cheese manufacturing.
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - Vitamin C inhibits staphylococcus aureus growth and enhances the inhibitory effect of quercetin on growth of Escherichia coli in vitro.
AB  - Quercetin is a natural flavonoid possessing a number of health beneficial effects. Its bioactivity is restricted by low solubility and sensitivity to oxidative degradation, factors that are often ignored in laboratory studies. We studied the antimicrobial effects of quercetin on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum at concentrations at which it is soluble and investigated how the antioxidant vitamin C modulates these activities. S. aureus was the most sensitive of the studied bacteria. After 12 hours of culturing, 90 microM quercetin decreased the growth of S. aureus to 75 % of the value for a control culture. 1 mM vitamin C combined with 90 microM quercetin diminished the growth of S. aureus drastically to 3 % of that of the control culture supplemented with vitamin C only. Interestingly, vitamin C by itself inhibited the growth of S. aureus as well, and 5 mM vitamin C inhibited growth completely. The growth inhibition of E. coli was slightly but significantly better in the presence of both quercetin and vitamin C than in the presence of quercetin alone. Probiotic L. plantarum was resistant to quercetin in the presence and absence of vitamin C. Enhancement of quercetin's antimicrobial activity by vitamin C is partly explained by the stabilizing effect of vitamin C on quercetin. Even though the acidity of vitamin C contributes to the inhibition of S. aureus growth, neutralized vitamin C also inhibits the growth efficiently even without quercetin. Our results suggest that vitamin C affects the metabolism of S. aureus and that these changes are likely to result in the observed growth inhibition. Although vitamin C itself is a powerful antioxidant, its aerobic metabolism increases oxidative stress on bacterial cells. Vitamin C may therefore be a safe and natural alternative for restricting the growth of S. aureus when non-toxicity is required.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus adherence to Caco-2 cells by lactobacilli and cell surface properties that influence attachment.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize human and animal intestinal tracts, causing certain gastrointestinal diseases. The adherence of enteric pathogens to host intestinal epithelial cells is important for their pathogenesis. In the present study, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum were investigated in vitro to examine their ability to competitively exclude S. aureus. Various factors involved in attachment, including bacterial status and cell concentration, growth phase, competition patterns, and surface-layer protein extracts, were also investigated. Live lactobacilli in the mid-log growth phase exhibited maximum inhibitory activity when lactobacilli were pre- or co-incubated with S. aureus. However, the inhibitory activity was significantly reduced when the lactobacilli were inactivated by heating or treated with LiCl. Furthermore, both lactobacilli possessed certain cell surface properties, such as hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation ability. L. salivarius and L. plantarum strongly inhibited S. aureus adherence to Caco-2 cells and their inhibition activity was significantly influenced by several factors that affect adhesion inhibition.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - [The influence of teichoic acids from probiotic lactobacilli on microbial adhesion to epithelial cells].
AB  - The effect of teichoic acids from lactobacillus strains on their adhesion to human buccal epithellium has been studied. It is shown that preliminary treatment of epithellium cells by teichoic acids caused a decrease of adhesion of L. plantarum 11/16, L. plantarum 195D strains by 39 and 30%, respectively. The influence of teichoic acid from lactobacilli on the adhesion of opportunistic microbial strains has been studied. It is established that teichoic acids from both lactobacilli strains brought to the decrease of adhesion of C. albicans to 29-34%. Teichoic acid from the strain L. plantarum 195D stimulated the adhesion of S. aureus 2.25 times, while teichoic acid from L. plantarum 11/16 did not influence the staphylococcal adhesion. There was also no effect of the studied teichoic acid on the adhesion of E. coli.
TI  - [Destruction of lactobacilli by Staphylococcus aureus bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances].
AB  - AIM: Determination of morpho-physiological changes in cells of a lactobacillus industry strain suppressed by antagonistically active clinical cultures of Staphylococcus aureus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 5 clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus detected among 42 strains isolated previously in atopic dermatitis were used. Bacteria of the industry strain Lactobacillus plantarum 8PA-3 that synthesize bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) were used as target-cells. Suppression of growth of lactobacilli cells by staphylococci was performed on modified agar nutrient medium MRS by delayed antagonism method. Ultrastructure changes in lactobacilli cells exposed to staphylococci BLIS were studied by various methods of transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Destructive changes (exfoliation of small layered fragments of peptidoglycan layers) were detected in the cell walls of lactobacilli suppressed by staphylococci BLIS, and rearrangement of ultrathin structure of their cytoplasm with the destruction of protein-ribosomal complex was noticed. CONCLUSION; Clinical S. aureus strains that produce BLIS, suppress antagonistic activity of lactobacilli were revealed, and morpho-physiological changes in lactobacilli target-cells damaged by BLIS were detected. Local damage of cell components manifested by the destruction of cytoplasm and formation of "cell shadows".
TI  - Characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in PDO Salers cheese.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making PDO Salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. Gerles from ten farms producing PDO Salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least 4 periods spread over two years. They were distinguished by their levels of Lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log CFU/cm(2)), Gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log CFU/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log CFU/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log CFU/cm(2)). They were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. These 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). The farm gerles were not contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. Even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in the 40 L experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. Using 40 L experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. They were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii,...), Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Curtobacterium oceanosedimentum Citrococcus spp., Brachybacterium rhamnosum, Kocuria rhizophila, Arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus). In less than 1 min, even in a 500 L farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Probiotic features of two oral Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - In this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. Samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (G1) and L. casei (G3). Both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of Candida albicans. The bacteriocin activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6358-P was shown only by L. plantarum G1. Moreover, the isolates G1 and G3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. The viability of G1 and G3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. The biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated Wistar rats, compared to control ones. No toxicity for NMRI Ham mice was observed. According to our experimental results, these findings imply that L. plantarum G1 and L. casei G3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - Antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  - Fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus EP167, Acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (CECT 5947) and Candida albicans MY1055) and two probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum LCH17 and Lactobacillus brevis LCH23). A total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. A total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. The Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus EP167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than Gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. Identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rRNA sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Xylariales dominated. Differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed among isolates from the same species. Some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by lysostaphin-expressing Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 in a modified genital tract secretion medium.
AB  - Lactobacillus species are a predominant member of the vaginal microflora and are  critical in maintaining an acidic vaginal environment thought to contribute to the prevention of a number of urogenital diseases. However, during menstruation the pH of the vaginal environment increases to neutrality, a pH conducive for Staphylococcus aureus proliferation and the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) in susceptible women. In order to generate Lactobacillus species capable of expressing lysostaphin (an endopeptidase that cleaves the cell wall of S. aureus) in a modified genital tract secretion medium (mGTS) under neutral-pH conditions, six prominent proteins from Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 spent medium were identified by mass spectrometry. Sequences for promoters, signal peptides, and mature lysostaphin were used to construct plasmids that were subsequently transformed into L. plantarum WCFS1. The promoter and signal sequences of Lp_3014 (putatively identified as a transglycosylase) or the promoter sequence of Lp_0789 (putatively identified as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) with the signal sequence of Lp_3014 exhibited lysostaphin activity on buffered medium containing heat-killed S. aureus. The cassettes were integrated into the chromosome of L. plantarum WCFS1, but only the cassette containing the promoter and signal sequence from Lp_3014 had integrated into the appropriate site. Coculture assays using buffered mGTS showed that lysostaphin expressed from L. plantarum WCFS1 reduced the growth of TSST-1-producing strains of S. aureus under neutral-pH conditions. This study provides the basis for determining whether lysostaphin-producing Lactobacillus strains could potentially be used as a means to inhibit the growth of S. aureus during menstruation.
TI  - Site-specific protein labeling with amine-containing molecules using Lactobacillus plantarum sortase.
AB  - Modification of proteins with small molecules is a widely used and powerful tool  in biological research. Enzymatic approaches are particularly promising because substrate specificity allows for site-specific modification. Sortase A, a transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus, cleaves between the T and G residues in the sequence LPXTG, and subsequently links the carboxyl group of the T residue to an amino group of N-terminal glycine oligomers by a native peptide bond. Although Gram-positive bacteria have several kinds of sortases, there are few reports concerning their expression and substrate specificity. Here, we demonstrate site-specific protein modification with primary amine-containing molecules catalyzed by Lactobacillus plantarum sortase. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was employed as a model protein, and an amine-containing biotin molecule was site-specifically conjugated with LPQTSEQ-tagged EGFP. We developed a novel Lactobacillus plantarum sortase that has different substrate specificity compared to Staphylococcus aureus sortase. Amine-directed protein modification was achieved using the Lactobacillus plantarum sortase ''LPQTSEQ'' sequence original recognition tag. Our results demonstrate a promising method for expanding the capabilities of site-specific protein-small molecule modification.
TI  - Antagonistic intestinal microflora produces antimicrobial substance inhibitory to Pseudomonas species and other spoilage organisms.
AB  - Chicken intestine harbors a vast number of bacterial strains. In the present study, antimicrobial substance produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum vN. The antimicrobial substance produced by this bacterium was designated vN-1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Erwinia amylovova. vN-1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to pH values ranging from 2.0 to 8.0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. The inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of action. This study revealed an antimicrobial substance with low molecular mass of less than 1 kDa as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for LAB isolated from chicken intestines. The detection of this antimicrobial substance addresses an important aspect of biotechnological control agents of spoilage caused by Pseudomonas spp. and promises the possibility for preservation of refrigerated poultry meat. Practical Application: The newly characterized antimicrobial substance and designated as vN-1 may have the potential to be used in food preservation.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum (VR1) isolated from an ayurvedic medicine (Kutajarista) ameliorates in vitro cellular damage caused by Aeromonas veronii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus plantarum is considered as a safe and effective probiotic microorganism. Among various sources of isolation, traditionally fermented foods are considered to be rich in Lactobacillus spp., which can be exploited for their probiotic attribute. Antibacterial property of L. plantarum has been demonstrated against various enteric pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo systems. This study was aimed at characterizing L. plantarum isolated from Kutajarista, an ayurvedic fermented biomedicine, and assessing its antagonistic property against a common enteropathogen Aeromonas veronii. RESULTS: We report the isolation of L. plantarum (VR1) from Kutajarista, and efficacy of its cell free supernatant (CFS) in amelioration of cytotoxicity caused by Aeromonas veronii. On the part of probiotic attributes, VR1 was tolerant to pH 2, 0.3% bile salts and simulated gastric juice. Additionally, VR1 also exhibited adhesive property to human intestinal HT-29 cell line. Furthermore, CFS of VR1 was antibacterial to enteric pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas veronii and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Detailed study regarding the effect of VR1 CFS on A. veronii cytotoxicity showed a significant decrease in vacuole formation and detrimental cellular changes in Vero cells. On the other hand, A. veronii CFS caused disruption of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and actin in MDCK cell line, which was prevented by pre-incubation with CFS of VR1. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report isolation of L. plantarum (VR1) from Kutajarista and characterisation for its probiotic attributes. Our study demonstrates the antagonistic property of VR1 to A. veronii and effect of VR1 CFS in reduction of cellular damage caused by A. veronii in both Vero and MDCK cell lines.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by kimchi prepared with bacteriocin-producing starter culture.
AB  - Kimchi (starter kimchi) was prepared with Leuconostoc citreum GJ7, a bacteriocin  producer, with the objective of preventing growth and/or survival of foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus. Numbers of the pathogens inoculated to 5.41 to 5.63 log CFU/mL into the filtrate of freshly made starter kimchi remained stable for the first 12 h of incubation at 10 degrees C. Reductions of 2.69, 2.88, and 3.42 log CFU/mL were observed 48 h after inoculation with E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhi, and S. aureus, respectively. Use of the bacteriocin-producing starter culture for kimchi fermentation significantly reduced the numbers of pathogens in the filtrate. Reductions of 3.85, 4.45, and 5.19 log CFU/mL were observed 48 h after inoculation for E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhi, and S. aureus, respectively. Presumably, the antimicrobial activity came from the ingredients of kimchi such as sulfur-containing compounds, low pH (approximately pH 4.5) produced by the conversion of sugars into organic acids and the bacteriocins potentially produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as kimchicin GJ7. Together, these data suggest that addition of a starter culture capable of producing bacteriocins could serve as a strategy to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption and that the kimchi filtrate itself may be used as a food preservative. Practical Application: The adaptation of the starter fermentation into kimchi induced a faster die off of the pathogens as compared to natural fermentation. The in situ bateriocin-production by Leuc. citreum GJ7 in kimchi would act with antimicrobial kimchi ingredients in a synergistic manner to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption.
TI  - Multi-spectrometric analyses of lipoteichoic acids isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid is a major cell wall virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria. LTAs from various bacteria have differential immunostimulatory potentials due to heterogeneity in their structures. Although recent studies have demonstrated that LTA isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum (pLTA) has anti-inflammatory properties and is less inflammatory than LTAs from pathogenic bacteria, little is known about the structure of pLTA. In this study, high-field NMR spectra of the pLTA were compared with those of LTA from pathogenic bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA). The 2D NMR results demonstrated that pLTA possesses alpha-linked hexose sugar substituents on the poly-glycerophosphate backbone instead of N-acetylglucosamine substituents, and unsaturated fatty acids in its glycolipids. The sugar substituents were revealed as an approximately 29:1 molar ratio of the glucose to galactose by HPAEC-PAD analysis. MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analyses identified the presence of unsaturated fatty acids in the glycolipid moieties of pLTA. In addition, the glycolipid structure was found to be composed of trihexosyl-diacyl- and/or trihexosyl-triacyl-glycerol ceramide units by means of unique fragment ions of the glycolipids. These results enabled us to elucidate the pLTA structure, which is distinctively different from canonical LTA structure, and suggest that the unique immunological property of pLTA might be caused by the pLTA structure.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - [Ability of human oral cavity indigenous lactobacilli to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To determine ability of lactobacilli strains indigenous for oral cavity of healthy persons to adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, coaggregation and formation of biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three anatagonistically active isolates of lactobacilli, including 5 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, 6--L. rhamnosus, 4--L. paracasei, and 8--L. fermentum, were studied. Characteristics of lactobacilli associated with adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, coaggregation, and formation of biofilms were determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were characterized by high and intermediate level of adhesion, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity, expressed ability to form biofilms and different coaggregation activity relative to test-strains Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis. CONCLUSION: Studied characteristics of lactobacilli could be used for development of new probiotics aimed at stabilization of oral cavity normoflora.
TI  - [Disorganization of biofilms of clinical strains of staphylococci by metabolites  of lactobacilli].
AB  - AIM: To study morpho-physiologic characteristics of clinical biofilm-forming strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis suppressed by metabolites of lactobacilli, which produce bacteriocin-like substances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two clinical biofilm-forming strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis were used. Strains Lactobacillus plantarum L3 and L. fermentum 97 were used as producers of bactericidal metabolites. Ability of staphylococci to form biofilms was studied after their growth during 18 h at 37 degrees C in beef-extract broth with subsequent registration of biofilms attached to walls and bottom of polystyrene plate and stained by 0.1% alcohol solution of crystal violet. Ultrastructural changes in target cells were visualized by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Suppressive effect of lactobacilli metabolites on formation of biofilms by staphylococci was established. Ultrasructural changes, which characterize disorganization of vital processes such as mitosis, synthesis of DNA and peptidoglycan layer, were revealed in target cells. Formation and detachment of peptidoglycan globules from cell wall surface externally were noted. CONCLUSION: Metabolites of lactobacilli are able to suppress formation of biofilms and induce ultrastructural changes in S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which lead to their destruction.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  - The objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  Lactobacillus spp. (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. Four types of beads, containing entrapped (E), surface and entrapped (ES), surface (S) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (C(ES)) were prepared and physically characterized. The antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization, freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. Multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, VIM-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and CTX-M-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. Alginate beads in which lactobacilli proliferated to the beads surface (ES and C(ES)) differed significantly from the other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. Lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both Gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. Beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (ES) resulted in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. The viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of soy edible films incorporated with thyme and oregano essential oils on fresh ground beef patties.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of soy protein edible films (SPEF) incorporated with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% oregano (OR) or thyme (TH) essential oils was evaluated against Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Lactobacillus plantarum by the inhibition zone test. Effects of SPEF containing 5% OR and TH or a mixture of OR+TH (ORT) were also tested on fresh ground beef during refrigerated storage (at 4 degrees C). OR and TH incorporated SPEF exhibited similar antibacterial activity against all bacteria in inhibition zone test. While E. coli, E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus were significantly inhibited by antimicrobial films, L. plantarum and P. aeruginosa appeared to be the more resistant bacteria. SPEF with OR, ORT, and TH did not have significant effects on total viable counts, lactic acid bacteria and Staphylococcus spp. when applied on ground beef patties whereas reductions (p<0.05) in coliform and Pseudomonas spp. counts were observed.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - A finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: Salmonella typhimurium EF 85-9, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterococcus faecalis JCM 8726, Staphylococcus aureus JCM 2151, and Yersinia enterocolitica JCM 7577. At the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. Screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and Microtiter plate growth assay. Six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. Four strains (M1-M4) belonged to Shigella species and the other two strains (M5 and M6) belonged to Salmonella species. The antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. The antimicrobial substances from M3, M4 and M6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees C with 100% relative activity. The bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain M2 was partially characterized. It exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except Enterobacter aerogenes JCM 1235 and Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM 1149. It was stable at a wide range of pH (3-11). There was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees C or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees C. This is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
TI  - Protein expression changes in human monocytic THP-1 cells treated with lipoteichoic acid from Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus (aLTA) and from Lactobacillus  plantarum LTA (pLTA) are both recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but cause different stimulatory effects on the innate immune and inflammatory responses, and their underlying cellular mechanisms are unknown. In this study, comparative proteome analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry on protein extracts from human monocyte THP-1 cells stimulated with either aLTA or pLTA. Differentially expressed proteins might be involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Cells treated with aLTA and with pLTA showed different protein expression profiles. Of 60 identified proteins, 10 were present only in treated cells (8 in aLTA-treated only, and 2 in pLTA-treated only), 1 protein (IMPDH2) was suppressed by pLTA, and 49 were up- or down-regulated more than three-fold by aLTA- or pLTA- stimulation. Several proteins involved in immunity or inflammation, antioxidation, or RNA processing were significantly changed in expression by aLTA- or pLTA-stimulation, including cyclophilin A, HLA-B27, D-dopachrome tautomerase, Mn- SOD, hnRNP-C, PSF and KSRP. These data demonstrated that aLTA and pLTA had different effects on the protein profile of THP-1 cells. Comparison of the proteome alterations will provide candidate biomarkers for further investigation of the immunomodulatory effects of aLTA and pLTA, and the involvement of aLTA in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. As an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL, whereas pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 (CECT 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. The genetically manipulated E. coli lpxC/tolC strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. The growth of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus paraplantarum LCH7, Lactobacillus plantarum LCH17, Lactobacillus fermentum LPH1, L. fermentum CECT 5716, Lactobacillus brevis LCH23, and Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT 5711) and pathogens (S. aureus EP167 and C. albicans MY1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. Only P. aeruginosa PAO1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. Structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. The antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.
TI  - Morphology, release characteristics, and antimicrobial effect of nisin-loaded electrospun gelatin fiber mat.
AB  - Gelatin electrospun (e-spun) fiber mats containing nisin were produced by electrostatic spinning of gelatin-nisin in 70% (vol/vol) acetic acid aqueous solutions. Varying nisin loading concentration (0 to 3% [wt/wt]) did not affect the fiber average diameter, whereas increasing gelatin concentration from 20 to 24% (wt/vol) caused an increase in the average diameter. All nisin-loaded gelatin e-spun fiber mats demonstrated inhibition against Lactobacillus plantarum TISTR 850. However, all fiber mats were fragile and easily dissolved in water. Cross-linking by saturated glutaraldehyde vapor at 37 degrees C for 5 min was done to strengthen the mat. Tensile strength, Young's modulus, and elongation of the cross-linked gelatin-nisin e-spun fiber mats varied in the range of 2.6 to 20.3 MPa, 163 to 966 MPa, and 1.7 to 5.9% , respectively. Cross-linking did not affect the mat's inhibition activity against L. plantarum TISTR 850. Nisin retention in cross-linked antimicrobial gelatin e-spun fiber mats was in the range of 1.0 to 1.22% . Increasing temperature caused an increase in nisin release, but increasing water activity did not cause a significant difference in nisin release over 50 h. After storage at 25 degrees C for 5 months, the antimicrobial gelatin e-spun fiber mat still showed inhibition against L. plantarum TISTR 850. The mats also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes but not Salmonella Typhimurium.
TI  - Peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by Lactobacillus casei through Toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  - We previously showed that Lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a quantity of interleukin-12 (IL-12). In this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on IL-12 production by macrophages that was induced by Lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. Easily digestible lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus plantarum or their intact cell walls (ICWs) weakly or very weakly induced IL-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedL. casei-induced IL-12 production. While the ICW of L. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit L. casei-induced IL-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted ICW, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Furthermore, the peptidoglycans of L. johnsonii, L. plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus also inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed L. casei-induced expression of IL-12p40 but not IL-12p35 mRNA. Inhibition of IL-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficient macrophages compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. A derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-O-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) could also suppress L. casei-induced IL-12 production. These findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress IL-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 and NOD2. IL-12 production in the gut may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.
TI  - Biopreservation of refrigerated and vacuum-packed Dicentrarchus labrax by lactic  acid bacteria.
AB  - Two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 100 LAB isolated from various sea products to examine their use in Dicentrarchus labrax preservation. The isolates, tentatively named strain nr 3 and 7, were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum and L. pentosus, respectively. They showed antagonistic activity against psychrotroph, pathogenic, and coliform bacteria. The antagonistic activity of strain 3 was suggested to be by bacteriocins since activity was abolished by protease treatment, while that of strain 7 was due to the effect of pH decrease caused by the produced organic acids. Their use prevented total volatile basic nitrogen contents (TVB-N) and trimethylamine (TMA) to some extent, suggesting that inoculation could extend the period of storage.
TI  - Screening and characterization of probiotic lactic acid bacteria isolated from Korean fermented foods.
AB  - To examine their potential as probiotics, acid and bile tolerance, antibiotics resistance, adhesion capacity to Caco- 2 and HT-29, and antibacterial activity, of LAB isolated from Korean fermented foods such as dongchimi, kimchi, Meju, and doenjang were assayed against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. DC 55, DC 136, DC 222, KC 117, KC 21, KC 24, KC 34, KC 43, MJ 301, MJ 54, SP 170, and SP 33 strains were resistant to acid and bile conditions. In particular, DC 55, DC 136, KC 24, KC 43, and MJ 301 strains were highly resistant to higher than 20 microg/ml concentrations of vancomycin, streptomycin sulfate, or amoxicillin, whereas, DC 222, KC 117, KC 21, KC 34, MJ 54, and SP 33 strains were susceptible to lower than 2microg/ ml concentrations of those antibiotics. The adhesion to HT-29 and Caco-2 cells varied with the strains tested in a strain-dependent manner. The highest level of adhesion was observed with DC 55, KC 21, KC 24, and MJ 301 strains, having higher than 50% of adhesion to HT-29 or Caco-2 cells. In addition, Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to KC 21, showing an inhibition of about 70%, and the antibacterial activity of KC 21 against S. aureus resulted most likely from both organic acids and bacteriocin. Based on its phenotypic characteristics and utilization of various sugars, the KC 21 strain was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by Lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
AB  - AIMS: Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain, isolated from Argentinian dry-fermented sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. It was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the pH range from 5.0 to 6.0. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. It was purified by RP (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. Plantaricin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 Da as determined by Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. It was shown to have a bactericidal effect against Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic pH), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
TI  - Selection of lactic acid bacteria from fermented plant beverages to use as inoculants for improving the quality of the finished product.
AB  - Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) from fermented plant beverages were selected based on  their antibacterial actions against potential food borne pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus PSSCMI 0004, Escherichia coli PSSCMI 0001, Salmonella typhimurium PSSCMI 0034 and Vibrio parahaemolyticus VP 4). Antibacterial activities were measured using an agar spot method. The Lactobacillus plantarum W90A strain isolated from a wild forest noni (Morinda coreia Ham) beverage was used as an inoculant. Three different inoculation procedures were conducted with the fruit of wild forest noni fermentations to establish which one was the best for controlling the numbers of yeast in the finished product. A 5% inoculum of L. plantarum W90A (LAB set), initial cell density 8.6 log cfu mL(-1), produced a better product and inhibitory properties against the test organisms, particularly E. coli PSSCMI 0001 than one with no inoculum or with a 5% inoculum from a previous natural fermented product. An LAB inoculum resulted in a reduced total bacterial count and no yeast throughout fermentation period (90 days). The lower yeast resulted in a reduction of the ethanol content to 2.9 g L(-1) compared to 12.2 g L(-1) inthe culture with no inoculum. The highest acidity (1.3-1.4%) with the same pH (3.3) was observed in both sets of inoculated fermentations, whereas the uninoculated set gave a pH value of 3.7 (1.2% acidity).
TI  - Binding and Cellular Activation Studies Reveal That Toll-like Receptor 2 Can Differentially Recognize Peptidoglycan from Gram-positive and Gram-negative Bacteria.
AB  - Although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. Such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than direct binding to monitor recognition. We have employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from Gram-positive (lysine-containing) and Gram-negative (diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (PGN). In the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from PGN remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. However, a wider range of DAP-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled PGN. The difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of PGN. It was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and DAP can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. Cellular activation studies employing highly purified PGN from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. The data firmly establish Toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for PGN and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.
TI  - Technological and safety properties of Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
AB  - A total of 17 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat and identified by biochemical and molecular methods, were characterized according to their technological properties including acidifying, antimicrobial and enzymatic activities as well as antibiotic resistance in order to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausages. All the strains studied showed good acidifying activity and were able to reduce the pH to less than 4.3 in 72, 48 and 24h at 15, 25 and 37 degrees C respectively. The majority of strains displayed antimicrobial activities against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa and Escherichia coli, however characterization of the antimicrobial substances showed that none of the strains could produce bacteriocins. All the L. plantarum strains were able to hydrolyze casein, whereas none of them was found to possess lipolytic activity. The majority of strains of L. plantarum were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin and penicillin G.
TI  - Differential immunostimulatory effects of Gram-positive bacteria due to their lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a major immunostimulating component in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria as lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. However, LTA is expressed on not only pathogenic but also nonpathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. In order to examine whether the immunostimulating potentials of Gram-positive bacteria are correlated with their LTAs, we prepared highly pure LTAs from Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Bacillus subtilis (non-pathogenic), or Lactobacillus plantarum (beneficial). When a murine macrophage cell-line, RAW 264.7, was stimulated with heat-killed bacteria, both S. aureus and B. subtilis induced nitric oxide (NO) production in a dose-dependent manner while L. plantarum showed a minimal induction. Interestingly, purified LTAs from S. aureus and B. subtilis, but not from L. plantarum, were able to induce the production of NO. The differential inflammatory potentials of LTAs coincided with their abilities to activate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is known to recognize Gram-positive bacteria and LTA, and transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1. Similar results were obtained with the expression of cytokines related to inflammation by RAW 264.7 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well. The ability of LTA to induce TNF-alpha and NO production was abolished when the LTAs were treated with 0.2 N NaOH. Collectively, we suggest that the immunostimulating potentials of Gram-positive bacteria differ due to their LTAs with differential potencies in the stimulation of TLR2.
TI  - Interference of Lactobacillus plantarum strains in the in vitro conjugative transfer of R-plasmids.
AB  - Probiotic compounds, which are often constituted of lactobacilli, exert a number  of health benefits through maintenance of the intestinal ecosystem balance. Among the important interactions that occur in the gut microbiota, plasmid transfer by mating is an increasing cause of concern, particularly when antibiotic-resistant genes are involved. Because lactobacilli seem to be able to influence this mechanism, the aim of the present work was to investigate the in vitro capability of two Lactobacillus plantarum strains (one bacteriocin producer and one nonproducer) to interfere with the conjugation processes. For this purpose different matings were performed adding to the donor and recipient cells L. plantarum 35d bac+ and L. plantarum 396/1 bac- as agents of interference. Conjugations added with a Staphylococcus aureus strain or without any agent of interference were used as controls. The results of our experiments demonstrated that both lactobacillus strains were able to decrease mating frequency. Statistically significant differences in the viable transconjugants were obtained in the presence and in the absence of the lactobacilli. The effect was almost the same with the two L. plantarum independent of bacteriocin production. In the trial performed with S. aureus, no decrease in mating frequency was observed, confirming that the capability to interfere with R-plasmid transfer ability could be a property of the tested L. plantarum strains.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of long-chain polyphosphates on selected spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of four long-chain food-grade polyphosphates were studied at concentrations allowed in the food industry (<5,000 ppm) in defined basal media by determining the inhibition of growth of three gram-negative and four gram-positive spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Both generation time and lag phase of Escherichia coli K-12, E. coli O157: H7, and Salmonella Typhimurium were increased with all of the polyphosphates tested. Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were more sensitive to polyphosphates, but not in all cases, with multiphased growth. The growth of Lactobacillus plantarum was inhibited by polyphosphates at concentrations above 750 ppm, but the lag time of Listeria monocytogenes was shortened by the presence of polyphosphates. No single polyphosphate was maximally inhibitory against all bacteria. Polyphosphates with chain lengths of 12 to 15 were significantly different from those with chain lengths of 18 to 21 depending on the organism and concentrations of polyphosphate used. Overall, higher polyphosphate concentrations resulted in greater inhibition of bacterial growth.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus plantarum lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on Staphylococcus aureus LTA-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a common etiologic agent for Gram-positive sepsis, and its lipoteichoic acid (LTA) may be important in causing Gram-positive bacterial septic shock. Here, we demonstrate that highly purified LTA (pLTA) isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum inhibited aureus LTA (aLTA)-induced TNF-alpha production in THP- cells. Whereas pLTA scarcely induced TNF-alpha production, aLTA induced excessive TNF-alpha production. Interestingly, aLTA-induced TNF-alpha production was inhibited by pLTA pretreatment. Compared with pLTA, aLTA induced strong signal transduction through the MyD88, NF-kappaB, and MAP kinases. This signaling, however, was reduced by a pLTA pretreatment, and resulted in the inhibition of aLTA-induced TNF-alpha production. Whereas dealanylated LTAs, as well as native LTAs, contributed to TNF- induction or TNF-alpha reduction, deacylated LTAs did not, indicating that the acyl chain of LTA played an important role in the LTA-mediated immune regulation. These results suggest that pLTA may act as an antagonist for aLTA, and that an antagonistic pLTA may be a useful agent for suppressing the septic shock caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains: potential use as probiotic.
AB  - Considering that several health promoting properties are associated with kefir consumption and a reliable probiotic product requires a complete identification of the bacterial species, the present work evaluates several proved markers of probiotic potential of eleven isolates of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains and molecular identification and genotypic diversity. Using restriction analysis of amplified ribosomal DNA (ARDRA) and analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA internal spacer region we confirmed that all homofermentative lactobacilli belong to the species Lactobacillus plantarum. RAPD-PCR analysis allowed the discrimination of lactobacilli in five clusters. All isolates exhibited high resistance to bile salt. High survival after one hour of exposure to pH 2.5 was observed in Lb. plantarum CIDCA 8313, 83210, 8327 and 8338. All isolates were hydrophilic and non autoaggregative. Isolate CIDCA 8337 showed the highest percentage of adhesion among strains. All tested lactobacilli had strong inhibitory power against Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Seven out of eleven isolates showed inhibition against Sal. enterica and five isolates were effective against Sal. gallinarum. Only CIDCA 8323 and CIDCA 8327 were able to inhibit Sal. sonnei. We did not find any correlation between the five clusters based on RAPD-PCR and the probiotic properties, suggesting that these isolates have unique characteristics.
TI  - Functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  - This paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. Functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. The organisms previously identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc dextranicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees C) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). The pH fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with Lb. plantarum; 4.37 in L. dextranicum+S. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. Significant differences (P <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. Bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among pH and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. Antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic A. flavus. The findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
TI  - Bioprotection of Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. Eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing and API 50CH. Most of them pertained to Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to Weissella spp. and Lactococcus lactis. Growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. The strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. Treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced the cell count of S. typhimurium and E .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of L. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. Results support the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.
TI  - Characterization of the structural gene encoding nisin F, a new lantibiotic produced by a Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate from freshwater catfish (Clarias gariepinus).
AB  - Lactococcus lactis F10, isolated from freshwater catfish, produces a bacteriocin  (BacF) active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The operon encoding BacF is located on a plasmid. Sequencing of the structural gene revealed no homology to other nisin genes. Nisin F is described.
TI  - Many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. FN3K homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. In 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the FN3K homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (LMW-PTP) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the FN3K homologue. Five bacterial FN3K homologues (from Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Staphylococcus aureus and Thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. Four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. They also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian FN3K-related protein. The E. coli FN3K homologue (YniA) was inactive on all tested substrates. The LMW-PTP of T. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an FN3K homologue, and an LMW-PTP of S. aureus (PtpA) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. These LMW-PTPs were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. It is concluded that most bacterial FN3K homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. They may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid from Lactobacillus plantarum elicits both the production of interleukin-23p19 and suppression of pathogen-mediated interleukin-10 in THP-1 cells.
AB  - In this study, the stimulatory effects of different lactic acid bacteria strains, and their subcellular fractions, on the THP-1 cell line were evaluated. Lactobacillus plantarum was found in particular to induce high levels of IL-23p19 mRNA, but it moderately induced TNF-alpha production. IL-10 production was not entirely affected by L. plantarum stimulation. When subcellular fractions of L. plantarum were used to treat THP-1 cells, IL-23p19 mRNA expression was enhanced in a dose-responsive manner, specifically by lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The cotreatment of THP-1 cells by both L. plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus LTA resulted in decreased IL-10 production when compared with cells treated by S. aureus LTA alone. Taken together, these data suggest that LTA isolated from L. plantarum elicits stimulatory effects upon the expression of IL-23p19 and inhibitory effects on pathogen-mediated IL-10 production.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - A synthetic analog of plantaricin 149 inhibiting food-borne pathogenic bacteria:evidence for alpha-helical conformation involved in bacteria-membrane interaction.
AB  - Plantaricin-149 is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum NRIC 149 (a  LAB isolated from pineapple), which consists of a peptidic chain made up of 22 amino acid residues [Kato et al. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1994; 77: 277-282]. In this work, a synthetic C-terminal amidated peptide analog denoted Pln149a was prepared by SPPS-Fmoc chemistry and the antagonistic activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was tested. The secondary structure was studied by circular dichroism (CD) and the vicinity of the tyrosine residue by fluorescence spectroscopy under different conditions. We report the results of the interaction of Pln149a with reverse micelles prepared from the amphiphilic AOT in cyclohexane. Synthetic plantaricin was active against one strain of Staphylococcus aureus and four strains of Listeria genus at pH 5.5 and 7.4 and, like its natural variant, inhibited L. plantarum ATCC 8014. The data derived from spectroscopic measurements in presence of AOT reverse micelles suggest that the secondary structure of the peptide upon interaction is an alpha-helix. In this membrane model, the hydrophobic side of the alpha-helix is inserted into the micelles, leaving the lysines exposed to the solvent and interacting with the polar moieties of AOT. The fluorescence data point out that the N-terminal tyrosine residue is close to the micellar interface.
TI  - Adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Five Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from African traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. The relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to HT29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the L. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to HT29 cells. Four L. plantarum and two L. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to HT29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. The two L. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with HT29 cells in a strain-dependent way. These two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) chemokine production by HT29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), did not occur. Altogether, our results suggested that L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii BFE 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
TI  - Limitations in the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive bacterial infection.
AB  - AIMS: To examine sensitivities of various Drosophila melanogaster strains towards human pathogenic and nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The D. melanogaster Oregon R strain was infected by injecting the thorax with a needle containing Escherichia coli (negative control), Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (both food-borne pathogens), Listeria innocua, Bacillus subtilis, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Lactobacillus plantarum or Pediococcus acidilactici (all nonpathogenic bacteria). Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus killed the host rapidly compared with the negative control. Infection with L. innocua, B. subtilis or C. maltaromaticum also resulted in a high fly mortality, whereas Lact. plantarum and P. acidilactici resulted in a slightly increased mortality. Four additional D. melanogaster lines, three of which had been selected for heat, cold and desiccation resistance respectively, were subjected to infection by L. monocytogenes, S. aureus and E. coli. Mortality rates were comparable with that of the Oregon R strain. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the injection method shows the limitation of D. melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive bacteria as opportunistic infection by nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria results in partial or high mortality. In addition, lines of fruit flies resistant to various stress exposures did not show an increased resistance to infection by gram-positive pathogens under the conditions tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the inadequacy of D. melanogaster infected by the injection method in order to distinguish between virulent and nonvirulent gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. METHODS: Three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles were synthesized containing C13 to C22 fatty chains. Susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium smegmatis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the MIC. RESULTS: Several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against MRSA (MIC = 36 mg/L), C. albicans (MIC = 4.4 mg/L), S. cerevisiae (MIC = 1.1 mg/L) and M. smegmatis (MIC = 8.9 mg/L). These amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. Alkyl chain length influenced the values of MIC; longer chains (C18-C22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. CONCLUSIONS: As the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. Thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. Further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  - Knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium brevicompactum). By far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of Pinus species. These extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. Both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated with the stilbene content of the extracts. Purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. The results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of Pinus knotwood extracts.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Identification and sequence of a tet(M) tetracycline resistance determinant homologue in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(M) in human clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. The homologue was >99% identical to the tet(M) genes reported to occur in Lactobacillus plantarum, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(M) of Staphylococcus aureus. Sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(M) in E. coli have homology to Tn916; however, a complete IS26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. Downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the ISVs1 element reported to occur in a plasmid from Vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(E). Results of mating experiments demonstrated that the E. coli tet(M) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible strain by conjugation. Expression of the cloned tet(M) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the E. coli host.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of carvacrol related to its chemical structure.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the relation between the chemical structure and the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol, eugenol, menthol and two synthesized carvacrol derivative compounds: carvacrol methyl ether and carvacryl acetate against bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, a yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and one fungi Botrytis cinerea. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity was tested in liquid and vapour phases, by both broth liquid and microatmosphere methods, respectively. The same classification of the compound's antimicrobial efficiency was found with both methods. Eugenol and menthol exhibited a weaker antimicrobial activity than carvacrol, the most hydrophobic compound. Carvacryl acetate and carvacrol methyl ether were not efficient, indicating that the presence of a free hydroxyl group is essential for antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The different extents of antimicrobial aroma compounds' efficiency showed that hydrophobicity is an important factor and the presence of a free hydroxyl group and a delocalized system allows proton exchange. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study has identified the importance of the hydrophobicity and the chemical structure of phenolic aroma compounds for antimicrobial activity and may contribute to a most rational use of these compounds as antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Lactobacilli in the female genital tract in relation to other genital microbes and vaginal pH.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between lactobacilli and other microbes and the association with vaginal pH in the female genital tract were examined. The study also included evaluation of the possibility of supplying probiotics to the genital tract by using panty liners impregnated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum LB931. METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study involving 191 healthy fertile women. Specified microbes were counted and vaginal pH was measured once a month for five consecutive months. RESULTS: Major individual variations in the genital microflora composition and the vaginal pH were found among the women. The number of lactobacilli was significantly related to vaginal pH (p<0.001) and approximately 70% of the women were permanent carriers of individual lactobacilli strains. Women with high numbers of lactobacilli were less prevalent with Group B streptococci than women with low numbers (p=0.036), and these women had a lower mean vaginal pH. The number of lactobacilli also correlated with the prevalence of yeast. LB931 could be found in 86% of the labial samples and 54% of the vaginal samples. CONCLUSIONS: High numbers of lactobacilli may contribute to a low vaginal pH and seem to have a negative influence on Group B streptococci. LB931 could be transferred from the panty liners to both the vagina and the labial fold.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The expression and secretion signals of the Sep protein from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by Lb. fermentum BR11, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin Ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. Buffering of the growth media to a neutral pH allowed detection of Ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. It was found that purified Ply511 has a pH activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. Supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by approximately 8 log(10) CFU/ml compared to controls. However, supernatants containing Ply511 were unable to control L. monocytogenes growth. In coculture experiments, both Lb. plantarum and Lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce MRSA cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)CFU/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting Ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes. Our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and Ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity. Lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of S. aureus infections.
TI  - The assessment of biological activities associated with the major constituents of the methanol extract of 'wild carrot' (Daucus carota L) seeds.
AB  - Daucus carota L. (Family: Apiaceae alt. Umbelliferae), commonly known as 'wild carrot' or 'Queen Anne's-lace,' is an ecologically invasive erect biennial naturalized to Scotland. The ethnobotanical uses of this species include applications in the treatment of cough, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, malaria and tumors, and as an antiseptic, abortifacient, aphrodisiac, carminative, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. The major constituents isolated from the methanol extract of D. carota seeds by reversed-phase preparative high performance chromatography were luteolin, luteolin 3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, three flavones. The constituents were assessed for their antibacterial and free radical scavenging activities, as well as toxicity towards brine shrimp. Among these three flavones, luteolin showed the highest degree of free radical scavenging activity (RC50 = 4.3 x 10(-4) mg/mL) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Both luteolin and its 4'-O-glucoside demonstrated bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration [MIC] = 5.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(-1) mg/mL). Luteolin also demonstrated antibactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Citrobacter freundii (MIC = 5.0 x 10(-2) mg/mL). Luteolin 3'-O-glucoside showed bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Lactobacillus plantarum (MIC = 2.5 x 10(-1) mg/mL and 5 x 10(-1) mg/ mL, respectively). In the brine shrimp lethality assay, the LD50 value of luteolin was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/mL, and that of its 3'-O-glucoside and 4'-O-glucoside were > 1.0 mg/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tenerife cheese: initial characterization of plantaricin TF711, a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Lactobacillus plantarum TF711.
AB  - AIMS: The screening and initial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from raw Tenerife goats' cheese with possible application as biopreservatives or ripening accelerators for Tenerife cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty LAB of the genera Lactobacillus (95), Leuconostoc (64) and Lactococcus (21) isolated from raw Tenerife goats' cheese were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. Lactobacillus plantarum TF711, which had the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, was selected for further characterization. The antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, as it was sensitive to proteases. The bacteriocin-like substance, which we called plantaricin TF711, was active against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; and against the Enterobacteriaceae Shigella sonnei and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It was stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. Highest antimicrobial activity was found between pH 1 and 9. Plantaricin TF711 exhibited primary metabolite kinetics, a bacteriostatic mode of action and a molecular mass of c. 2.5 kDa as determined by tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSIONS: Lact. plantarum TF711 produces a low molecular mass bacteriocin-like compound with a wide spectrum of activity and interesting technological properties (thermostability, good pH stability and stability against surfactants and organic solvents). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Plantaricin TF711 was found to have potential for use as a biopreservative in the food industry.
TI  - pIH01, a small cryptic plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum IH3.
AB  - A small cryptic plasmid pIH01 from Leuconostoc citreum IH3 was characterized. This 1.8-kb sized plasmid contains single open reading frame that encodes a RepC class protein (342 amino acids) and a conserved pT181-type double strand origin, suggesting a rolling circle replication mode. This putative replicase protein shows the highest similarity to a replicase from pFR18 plasmid of Leuconostoc mesenteroides FR52 (64% identity), one of the pT181-type rolling circle plasmid family and contains a strictly conserved RepC-type active site sequence of pT181 family. A shuttle vector that was developed on the basis of this cryptic plasmid by insertion of both erythromycin resistance gene (ermC) from pE194 and Escherichia coli ColE1 origin was able to transform Leuconostoc strains, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactococcus lactis. Therefore, pIH01 derivative plasmids might be useful for the manipulation of Leuconostoc strains.
TI  - In vitro screening of potential probiotic activities of selected lactobacilli isolated from unpasteurized milk products for incorporation into soft cheese.
AB  - The aim was to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli from 88 strains isolated from unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and to incorporate these bacteria in a viable state into a soft cheese, without changing its quality. The survival of these bacteria was assessed in acidic and bile conditions, after freezing at -80 degrees C. Four strains from unpasteurized Camembert--two Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lb. paracasei/casei strains--were identified and typed by PCR and PFGE and were found to display potentially probiotic characteristics in addition to resistance to low pH and bile. These characteristics were resistance to lysozyme, adhesion to CACO-2 cells, antimicrobial effects against common foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, innocuity following the ingestion of high doses by mice and appropriate antibiotic susceptibility profiles. The potential of Lb. plantarum strain UCMA 3037 for incorporation into a soft cheese (Pont-l'Eveque registered designation of origin (RDO)) was investigated. This strain grew well and survived in sufficient numbers (more than 10(7) cfu/g throughout the shelf-life of the product) in the cheese. This strain did not change the quality score of the product until the best before date (75 days after manufacture). Thus, unpasteurized Camembert is a natural source of potentially probiotic lactobacilli, which could be used as an additive in the development of potentially probiotic soft cheeses. Further work is required to demonstrate the persistence and efficacy of these strains in the human host upon ingestion.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Spectrum of bacteriocin activity of Lactobacillus plantarum BS and fingerprinting by RAPD-PCR.
AB  - The spectrum of antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus plantarum BS against representative bacterial species was established through deferred assay and 'spot-on-lawn' assay using actively growing cells and partially purified bacteriocin extract, respectively. Only lactobacilli, pediococci, enterococci, bacilli and Listeria were inhibited from the test microorganisms. Slight bacteriocinogenic activity through 'spot-on-lawn' assay was detected against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) analysis was used to compare the fingerprint of L. plantarum BS with other strains of L. plantarum. Using the 16S rRNA-based primer, P32, the bacteriocinogenic isolate exhibited identical RAPD-PCR fingerprints to L. plantarum ATCC 14917. Dendrograms derived from the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) were constructed to show the similarity relationships among the investigated strains based on RAPD-PCR analysis. Bands differentiating L. plantarum BS from L. plantarum ATCC 14917 were also identified by varying the annealing temperature.
TI  - Interactions between high pressure homogenization and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase.
AB  - It was the objective of this work to evaluate the effect of high pressure homogenization on the activity of antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase against a selected group of Gram positive and Gram negative species inoculated in skim milk. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Listeria monocytogenes were the most pressure resistant species while Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enteritidis were found to be very sensitive to the hyperbaric treatment. The enzyme addition enhanced the instantaneous pressure efficacy on almost all the considered species as indicated by their instantaneous viability loss following the treatment. Moreover, the combination of the enzyme and high pressure homogenization significantly affected the recovery and growth dynamics of several of the considered species. Although L. monocytogenes was slightly sensitive to pressure, the combination of the two stress factors induced a significant viability loss within 3 h and an extension of lag phases in skim milk during incubation at 37 degrees C. The hypothesis formulated in this work is that the interaction of high pressure homogenization and lysozyme or lactoperoxidase is associated to conformational modifications of the two proteins with a consequent enhancement of their activity. This hypothesis is supported by the experimental results also regarding the increased antimicrobial activity against L. plantarum of the previously pressurised lysozyme with respect to that of the native enzyme.
TI  - Commensal Gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced IL-23 and IL-27 expression and enhanced Th1 development.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. Depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of Th1, Th2 or unpolarized Th cell responses. In this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides vulgatus,Veillonella parvula, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived DC (moDC). None of the Gram-positive bacteria (GpB) primed for Th1 or Th2 development. In contrast, despite the low levels of IL-12 they induce, all Gram-negative bacteria (GnB) primed moDC for enhanced Th1 cell development, which was dependent on IL-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. Strikingly, GnB-matured moDC expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mRNA, the critical subunits of IL-23 and IL-27, respectively, suggesting that the IL-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their Th1-driving capacity. Purified major cell wall components of either GnB or GpB did not yield Th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the IL-12 family members nor Th1 priming by GnB. Importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different IL-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature DC.
TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a Greek dry-fermented sausage in respect of their technological and probiotic properties.
AB  - A total of 147 lactic acid bacteria was isolated from two types of naturally fermented dry sausages at four different stages of the ripening process studied in order to select the most suitable strains according to their technological characteristics including probiotic properties and antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens. Identification of the isolates revealed that 90% were lactobacilli, 4% enterococci, 3% Pediococcus sp. and sporadic isolates of Weissella viridescens, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and Leuconostoc sp. The isolated strains of Lactobacillus sakei (49 isolates), Lactobacillus curvatus (24 isolates) and Lactobacillus plantarum (7 isolates) were further characterized. All strains could grow at 15 degrees C, whereas the majority of the strains was able to grow in the presence of 6.5% NaCl and on acetate agar. The enzymatic potential of the strains was evaluated using the API ZYM system. During in vitro investigations all strains exhibited high leucine and valine aminopeptidase activities and moderate acid phosphatase and phosphohydrolase activities. Some strains showed very weak lipolytic activity. The enzyme profiling is an important factor for selection of strains as starter cultures. A large majority of the strains tolerated 0.1% bile salts whereas 58% of Lactobacillus curvatus strains and all Lactobacillus plantarum strains were resistant to 0.3% bile salts. All Lactobacillus sakei strains and the majority of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus plantarum strains exhibited an anti-listerial activity against three Listeria monocytogenes strains. A percentage of 75, 50 and 29% of Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus and L. plantarum strains, respectively, could inhibit two Staphylococcus aureus strains. The contribution of the selected strains to a possible inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus in situ on fermented meats would be of considerable interest to enhance the hygienic quality of these products.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of tet(M) genes in Lactobacillus isolates from different types of fermented dry sausage.
AB  - The likelihood that products prepared from raw meat and milk may act as vehicles  for antibiotic-resistant bacteria is currently of great concern in food safety issues. In this study, a collection of 94 tetracycline-resistant (Tc(r)) lactic acid bacteria recovered from nine different fermented dry sausage types were subjected to a polyphasic molecular study with the aim of characterizing the host organisms and the tet genes, conferring tetracycline resistance, that they carry. With the (GTG)(5)-PCR DNA fingerprinting technique, the Tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, L. sakei subsp. sakei, L. curvatus, and L. alimentarius and typed to the intraspecies level. For a selection of 24 Tc(r) lactic acid bacterial isolates displaying unique (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprints, tet genes were determined by means of PCR, and only tet(M) was detected. Restriction enzyme analysis with AccI and ScaI revealed two different tet(M) allele types. This grouping was confirmed by partial sequencing of the tet(M) open reading frame, which indicated that the two allele types displayed high sequence similarities (>99.6%) with tet(M) genes previously reported in Staphylococcus aureus MRSA 101 and in Neisseria meningitidis, respectively. Southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed that the isolates contained tet(M)-carrying plasmids. In addition to the tet(M) gene, one isolate also contained an erm(B) gene on a different plasmid from the one encoding the tetracycline resistance. Furthermore, it was also shown by PCR that the tet(M) genes were not located on transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed molecular study demonstrating that taxonomically and genotypically diverse Lactobacillus strains from different types of fermented meat products can be a host for plasmid-borne tet genes.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of cucumber fruit through adhesion.
AB  - In this study, the adhesion of bacteria to fresh cucumber surfaces in aqueous suspension was shown to be dependent on time of incubation, inoculum species and concentration, and temperature. The adhesion of bacteria to the fruit in wash water was less extensive at lower temperatures and shorter exposure times. Various species of bacteria were adsorbed to cucumber surfaces in the following relative order: Salmonella Typhimurium > Staphylococcus aureus > Lactobacillus plantarum > Listeria monocytogenes. Cells were adsorbed at all temperatures tested (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) at levels that depended on incubation time, but the numbers of cells adsorbed were larger at higher incubation temperatures. Levels of adhesion of bacteria to dewaxed fruit were higher for L. monocytogenes and lower for Salmonella Typhimurium, L. plantarum, and S. aureus than were levels of adhesion to waxed fruit.
TI  - The lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising Escherichia coli LMM1010  and MG1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (LP) system at naturally occurring concentration was studied. In the absence of pressure treatment, the LP system had either no effect, i.e. on S. Typhimurium and E. coli LMM1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on E. coli MG1655, L. innocua, S. aureus, L. plantarum and E. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on P. fluorescens. The presence of the LP system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. At low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the LP system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant E. coli. At high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of L. innocua, E. faecalis and L. plantarum were enhanced. For both E. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. It was found that in the presence of the LP system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the first hours after pressure treatment. The potential of the LP system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.
TI  - Characterization of the tetracycline resistance plasmid pMD5057 from Lactobacillus plantarum 5057 reveals a composite structure.
AB  - The 10,877bp tetracycline resistance plasmid pMD5057 from Lactobacillus plantarum 5057 was completely sequenced. The sequence revealed a composite structure containing DNA from up to four different sources. The replication region had homology to other plasmids of lactic acid bacteria while the tetracycline resistance region, containing a tet(M) gene, had high homology to sequences from Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Within the tetracycline resistance region a Lactobacillus IS-element was found. The remaining part of the plasmid contained three open reading frames with unknown functions. The composite structure with several truncated genes suggests a recent assembly of the plasmid. This is the first sequence of an antibiotic resistance plasmid isolated from L. plantarum.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Listeria innocua and Leuconostoc dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens and two strains of Escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 MPa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 MPa) was compared in this study. Within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. All gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. Within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. Further it appears that the mutant E. coli LMM1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure homogenisation than its parental strain MG1655. The preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. Further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus cell population by using low pH (5.5 7), NaCl (0 6%) or SDS (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. Finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chitosans and chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (Mws) were examined against four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and L. bulgaricus). Chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with Mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and Mws of chitosan. As a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. Antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by pH (pH 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower pH value.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Identification of the translocating bacteria in rats with acute liver injury and  their relation to the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the intestine and the bacteria found in liver, mesenteric  lymph nodes, portal and arterial blood after D-galactosamine-induced liver injury, with and without pretreatment with Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 9843, were studied in the rat. Dominating representatives were identified to species level by 16S rDNA sequencing and typed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) for strain definition. It was proven that bacterial strains from the intestine occur at extraintestinal sites after liver injury. Lactobacillus spp. dominated the intestinal flora and were also the most frequently found genus in the liver and the mesenteric lymph nodes. Some of the blood isolates, identified as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides merdae, were not found as a dominating part of the mucosal flora. Treatment with L. plantarum before liver injury decreased translocation and made the intestinal flora increasingly dominated by lactobacilli.
TI  - Microbiological and biochemical characteristics of Canestrato Pugliese cheese made from raw milk, pasteurized milk or by heating the curd in hot whey.
AB  - Canestrato Pugliese cheeses were produced from raw ewes' milk (R and R(II) cheeses), pasteurized ewes' milk (P cheese) and by heating the curd in hot whey according to a traditional protocol (T cheese). R(II) differed from R cheese mainly by having been produced from raw milk with a higher number of somatic cells, 950.000 vs. 750.000 ml(-1), respectively. Compared to P and T cheeses, R and R(II) cheeses had a higher concentration (one or two orders of magnitude) of cheese-related bacteria such as adventitious mesophilic lactobacilli, enterococci and staphylococci. At the end of ripening, all cheeses contained less than 1.0 log cfu g(-1) of total and fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were not detected. As shown by phenotypic identification and RAPD-PCR, R cheese contained the largest number of mesophilic lactobacilli species and the greatest diversity of strains within the Lactobacillus plantarum species. Primary proteolysis did not differ appreciably among the cheeses. On the contrary, both urea-PAGE and the RP-HPLC analyses of the water-soluble N fractions showed the more complex profiles in cheeses produced by raw milks. R and R(II) cheeses had the highest values of water-soluble N/total N (ca. 30%) and the highest concentration of total free amino acids (ca. 40 mg g(-1) which approached or exceeded those reported for Italian cheeses with very high level of proteolysis during ripening. The main differences between R-R(II) and P-T cheeses were the concentrations of aspartic acid, proline, alanine, isoleucine, histidine and lysine. The water-soluble extracts of R and R(II) cheeses contained levels of amino-, imino- and di-peptidase activities, which were about twice those found in P and T cheeses. Cheeses differed slightly in the concentration of total free fatty acids that ranged between 1673 and 1651 mg kg(-1) in R and R(II) cheeses, and 1397 and 1334 mg kg(-1) in P and T cheeses. Butyric, caproic, capric, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids were found at the highest concentrations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from plants against selected pathogenic  and saprophytic microorganisms.
AB  - The beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. Inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. Antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. Minimum lethal concentration (MLC) was determined by the tube dilution method. Essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley, and rosemary were evaluated. Inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O:157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus plantarum, Aspergillus niger, Geotrichum, and Rhodotorula. Oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (MLC, approximately 8 ppm). Coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (MLC, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to E. coli O:157:H7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. Anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. Because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.
TI  - Selective sensitization of bacteria to peroxide damage associated with fluoride inhibition of catalase and pseudocatalase.
AB  - Fluoride and sulfide are known inhibitors of heme catalases in acid environments. Staphylococcus aureus H cells were found to be sensitized by fluoride or sulfide to H2O2 killing at acid pH values in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, and catalase activity was reduced concomitantly. In contrast, fluoride had little effect on H2O2 killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, which has fluoride-insensitive peroxidase activity, but still is more sensitive to H2O2 than is S. aureus in the absence of fluoride. Fluoride but not sulfide was inhibitory also for the Mn-containing, non-heme pseudocatalase of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14431 over a wide pH range, and this inhibitory effect was reflected in enhanced H2O2 killing in the presence of fluoride. In addition, we found that catalase-positive S. aureus or Neisseria sicca could protect catalase-negative S. mutans against killing by H2O2 in mixed suspensions, but protection was compromised by fluoride or sulfide under acid conditions. Thus, catalase-positive organisms could protect a catalase-negative organism against peroxide damage, but inhibition of catalase reduced protection. These findings are pertinent to the widespread use of fluoride and peroxide in oral health care products.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The possibility of using the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. The prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mRNA, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). To prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. High copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in L. plantarum and L. pentosus strains. Several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. Genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. The vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. But the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. L. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. In addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - The effect of a commercial starter culture addition on the ripening of an artisanal goat's cheese (Cameros cheese).
AB  - The evolution of physicochemical parameters, and the most important microbial groups, were determined for the following three batches of 'Cameros' goat's milk cheese during ripening: Batch R elaborated with raw milk, Batch RS elaborated with raw milk and with the addition of a starter culture, and Batch PS elaborated with pasteurized milk and with the addition of the same culture. No differences in total solids (TS) or in the content of NaCl, fat and total nitrogen (expressed as percentages of TS) were found during the ripening. The pH, fat acidity and non-protein nitrogen (NPN, expressed as a percentage of TN) showed significant differences between the batches. The inoculated batches showed the fastest drop in pH at the beginning of the ripening period, but the cheeses of Batch R showed a higher degree of lipolysis and proteolysis. The addition of a starter influenced the microbiological quality of the cheeses. Differences in the counts of Enterobacteriaceae and faecal coliforms were found between Batches R and RS after 15 days. Staphylococcus aureus increased in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population above 6 log cfu g-1 in Batch R in the period from 5 to 10 days. However, enterotoxins were not detected in this Batch. Batch R showed lower values of lactic acid bacteria at the beginning of the ripening period, but no significant differences were found between batches in the period from 5 to 15 days of ripening. At the beginning of the ripening, Lactococcus was the main lactic acid bacteria, with L. lactis lactis being predominant. After 15 days, the lactic acid bacteria counts decreased in the three batches, especially in the cheeses of Batch PS (only 2.2 log cfu g-1 was found at 60 days), as lactococci (the only lactic acid bacteria present in Batch PS) are incapable of growing under the conditions found in cheeses at the end of their ripening period. At this time, Lactobacillus was the predominant genus in Batches R and RS, with L. plantarum predominant. No lactococci were found from day 30 in Batch R and from day 40 in Batch RS. The cheeses of Batch RS received the most favourable scores from the tasting panel for all attributes judged: cut appearance, colour, aroma, taste, texture and general acceptance.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by Lactobacillus plantarum ST 31 isolated from sourdough.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum ST31 isolated from sourdough produced an antimicrobial substance inhibiting other strains of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus and some foodborne pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus. This antimicrobial substance was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin and was designated plantaricin ST31. This bacteriocin was stable in the pH range 3-8 and it was not affected by amylolytic enzymes. Production of plantaricin was pH and temperature dependent, and maximum yields were obtained in MRS broth cultures maintained at pH 6 and incubated at 30 degrees C in the exponential phase to the early stationary growth phase of the producer organism. This bacteriocin was purified by using consecutive ammonium sulfate and reversed-phase chromatography. It is a peptide of 20 amino acid residues with a mass of 2755+/-0.3 Da, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The sequence of Plantaricin ST31 showed no similarity to those of other bacteriocins. Plantaricin ST31 production appeared to be chromosomally encoded.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Synergist effect of sucrose fatty acid esters on nisin inhibition of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Nisin in combination with the sucrose fatty acid esters, sucrose palmitate (P-1570 and P-1670) or sucrose stearate (S-1570 and S-1670) was tested against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Initial liquid culture investigation showed that the sugar ester P-1670 resulted in a synergist enhancement of the bacteriostatic activity of nisin against Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria. Some enhancement of the bactericidal activity of nisin against Listeria monocytogenes was also observed. This increased nisin inhibitory effect was confirmed on solid media using plates with gradients of pH and NaCl. Synergism was observed with all four sucrose fatty acid esters, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity of nisin against several strains of L. monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus (both cells and spores), Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of nisin and the sucrose fatty acid esters showed no inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis, Salm. typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the locus responsible for production of plantaricin S, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LPCO10.
AB  - A 4.5-kb region of chromosomal DNA carrying the locus responsible for the production of plantaricin S, a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LPCO10 (R. Jimenez-Diaz, J. L. Ruiz-Barba, D. P. Cathcart, H. Holo, I. F. Nes, K. H. Sletten, and P. J. Warner, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:4459-4463, 1995), has been cloned, and the nucleotide sequence has been elucidated. Two genes, designated plsA and plsB and encoding peptides alpha and beta, respectively, of plantaricin S, plus an open reading frame (ORF), ORF2, were found to be organized in an operon. Northern blot analysis showed that these genes are cotranscribed, giving a ca. 0.7-kb mRNA, whose transcription start point was determined by primer extension. Nucleotide sequences of plsA and plsB revealed that both genes are translated as bacteriocin precursors which include N-terminal leader sequences of the double-glycine type. The role of ORF2 is unknown at the moment, although it might be expected to encode an immunity protein of the type described for other bacteriocin operons. In addition, several other potential ORFs have been found, including some which may be responsible for the regulation of bacteriocin production. Two of them, ORF8 and ORF14, show strong homology with histidine protein kinase and response regulator genes, respectively, which have been found to be involved in the regulation of the production of other bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria. A third ORF, ORF5, shows homology with gene agrB from Staphylococcus aureus, which is involved in the mechanism of regulation of the virulence phenotype in this species. Thus, an agr-like regulatory system for the production of plantaricin S is postulated.
TI  - Protein A as a fusion partner for the expression of heterologous proteins in Lactobacillus.
AB  - An expression system based on the Staphylococcus aureus protein A gene (spa) was  developed to allow the production and export of proteins in Lactobacillus. Plasmid shuttle vectors were constructed that carried the eZZ gene, a synthetic gene based on the Protein A gene (spa) but lacking the carboxy-terminal membrane-anchoring region. A gene fusion was created between the eZZ gene and the VD4 region of a chlamydial major outer-membrane protein gene. Expression studies demonstrated the recognition of the spa regulatory signals by several Lactobacillus, with the recombinant protein being expressed (from 0.1 microgram of EZZVD4 fusion protein per ml in L. plantarum up to 10 micrograms of EZZ protein per ml in L. fermentum) and exported (levels up to 20% in L. fermentum) in several Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for Butyrivibrios.
AB  - As a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  - Ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. For gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, MICs were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. Ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. The microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. B. cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. However, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. The disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Application of antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria to control pathogens  in ready-to-use vegetables.
AB  - Five psychrotrophic strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lact. plantarum and Pediococcus spp.) were isolated from 22 samples of commercial salads. These strains were shown to inhibit Aeromonas hydrophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus on MRS agar, in salads and in juice prepared from vegetable salads. Lactobacillus casei IMPCLC34 was most effective in reducing total mesophilic bacteria and the coliform group; Aer. hydrophila, Salm. typhimurium and Staph. aureus disappeared after 6 d of storage, while the counts for L. monocytogenes remained constant. The potential application of antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria as biopreservatives of ready-to-use vegetables is suggested.
TI  - Studies on bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus isolates from selected Nigerian fermented foods.
AB  - Ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) Lactobacillus isolates obtained from three Nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: Lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas cavice, Salmonella typhimurium, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Staphylococcus aureus. All the bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus were found to inhibit L. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. The antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from L. plantarum KKY12 and L. casei OGM12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. They are designated Plantacin N and Caseicin A and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. Plantacin N from L. plantarum KKY12 was active against L. plantarum, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas sobria and Aeromonas cavice whereas Caseicin A from L. casei OGM12 inhibited L. plantarum, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Caseicin A is stable at 121 degrees C/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. The bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of Lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.
TI  - Microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (Colocynthis citrullus L.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  - Microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. polymyxa, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, La. brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Micrococcus and Candida spp. The rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis.
TI  - The gene encoding plantaricin A, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus plantarum C11,  is located on the same transcription unit as an agr-like regulatory system.
AB  - Purification and amino acid sequencing of plantaricin A, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus plantarum C11, revealed that maximum bacteriocin activity is associated with the complementary action of two almost-identical peptides, alpha and beta (J. Nissen-Meyer, A. G. Larsen, K. Sletten, M. Daeschel, and I. F. Nes, J. Gen. Microbiol. 139:1973-1978, 1993). A 5-kb chromosomal HindIII restriction fragment containing the structural gene of plantaricin A was cloned and sequenced. Only one gene encoding plantaricin A was found. The gene, termed plnA, encodes a 48-amino-acid precursor peptide, of which the 22 and 23 C-terminal amino acids correspond to the purified peptides. Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated that a probe complementary to the coding strand of the plantaricin A gene hybridized to a 3.3-kb mRNA transcript. Further analysis of the 3.3-kb transcript demonstrated that it contains three additional open reading frames (plnB, plnC and plnD) downstream of plnA. The DNA sequences of plnB, plnC, and plnD revealed that their products closely resemble members of bacterial two-component signal transduction systems. The strongest homology was found to the accessory gene regulatory (agr) system, which controls expression of exoproteins during post-exponential growth in Staphylococcus aureus. The finding that plnABCD are transcribed from a common promoter suggests that the biological role played by the bacteriocin is somehow related to the regulatory function of the two-component system located on the same operon.
TI  - Detection of caries-inducing microorganisms in hyposalivated rats without infection of mutans streptococci.
AB  - Rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and S. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. Administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against S. aureus. These results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. Three strains of Lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. The caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. After a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with L. fermentum TY1R. On the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either L. acidophilus TY7R or L. plantarum TY3R. These results indicate that L. fermentum may be one of causative agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus strains isolated from dry fermented sausages.
AB  - One hundred strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from dry cured sausages were tested for antagonistic activity against a set of test strains. Nine of 52 strains of Lactobacillus casei and three of 48 strains of Lact. plantarun produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. The substance excreted by Lact. casei CRL 705 was active against Lact. plantarum, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The activity of the antibacterial compound from Lact. casei CRL 705 was destroyed by papain, trypsin and pepsin, but was resistant to heat (100 degrees C for 20 min), lysozyme and catalase. The agent was produced during the growth cycle and when the concentrated and neutralized supernatant fluid was added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. A decrease in optical density (O.D.) over time, indicative of cell lysis, was also observed. These characteristics allowed us to identify the inhibitory compound as a bacteriocin which we termed Lactocin 705.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - A study of five bacteriophages of the Myoviridae family which replicate on different gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A comparative study is reported on five phages of the Myoviridae family which propagate on Bacillus subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus plantarum, or Staphylococcus aureus. The phages are morphologically identical and characterized by isometric heads with conspicuous capsomers and by contractile tails with complex base plates. The phages show similar protein profiles, but vary considerably in burst size. Phage DNAs are about 95-166 kb in size and are unrelated by DNA-DNA hybridization and restriction endonuclease analysis. Therefore the phages are unrelated at species level. Implications of these data for our understanding of the development of phage species are discussed.
TI  - [The fibronectin binding of salmonellae studied by a passive hemagglutination method].
AB  - The study has shown that the fibronectin-binding properties of different Salmonella species can be tested by means of passive hemagglutination with fibronectin-sensitized formulated sheep red blood cells (SRBC). S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium isolated from foodstuffs, as well as the representatives of the species S. kottbus, S. anatum, S. tshiongwe and S. newlands, are capable of binding fibronectin. Fibronectin-binding properties have also been detected in Shigella sonnei, as well as in eubiotic microorganisms Escherichia coli M 17 and Lactobacillus plantarum. In pH ranging from 6.5 to 7.4 salmonellae, shigellae and E. coli agglutinate fibronectin-sensitized SRBC much more effectively in acidic pH values, while changes in pH have been found to produce no essential influence on the fibronectin-binding capacity of Staphylococcus aureus and lactobacilli.
TI  - The influence of Lactobacillus plantarum culture inoculation on the fate of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium in Montasio cheese.
AB  - The growth and survival of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium were  investigated during the manufacturing and ripening of raw milk Montasio cheese. Initial inoculated populations in the cheese milk were about 10(5) cfu/ml for S. aureus and 10(6) cfu/ml for S. typhimurium. Samples of curds and cheeses were taken during manufacturing and storage and analysed for pH and microbial populations. S. aureus increased slightly in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population of about 10(6) cfu/ml during the remaining period of storage. S. typhimurium decreased during cheesemaking and storage but persisted through 90 days. The addition of Lactobacillus plantarum culture (0.2% v/v) produced a marked reduction in populations of the test strains in 10 days of storage. Enterotoxin A was not detected in Montasio cheese even with a S. aureus population of 1.1 X 10(7) cfu/ml. L. plantarum strains were also tested by the spot method and the associative growth approach for their antagonistic activity against S. aureus and S. typhimurium. The compound excreted by L. plantarum was active only toward S. aureus. Furthermore, its activity was destroyed by protease treatment. These results indicated that while the growth of S. typhimurium is reduced by the acid production, S. aureus inhibition can be ascribed to bacteriocin production.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli and streptococci.
AB  - Of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria commonly used as starter cultures for the dalry industry and ensiling, six (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. acidophilus CH=5, L. plantarum, Streptococcus latis and Strep. taecium) had antibiotic activity. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics. The most sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus was used as a target micro-organism for the characterization of the antimicrobial substance. The cultures of Streptococcus faecium and L. plantarum gave the most intense antimicrobial activity. Adding CaCO3 to the medium (to bind accumulated lactic acid) increased the antibiotic activity of the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - Isolation of a replication region of a large lactococcal plasmid and use in cloning of a nisin resistance determinant.
AB  - The replication region of a 28-kilobase-pair (kbp) cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis SSD207 was cloned in L. lactis subsp. lactis MG1614 by using the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the streptococcal plasmid pGB301 as a selectable marker. The resulting 8.1-kbp plasmid, designated pVS34, was characterized further with respect to host range, potential cloning sites, and location of replication gene(s). In addition to lactococci, pVS34 transformed Lactobacillus plantarum and, at a very low frequency, Staphylococcus aureus but not Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. The 4.1-kbp ClaI fragment representing lactococcal DNA in pVS34 contained unique restriction sites for HindIII, EcoRI, XhoII, and HpaII, of which the last three could be used for molecular cloning. A region necessary for replication was located within a 2.5-kbp fragment flanked by the EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites. A 3.8-kbp EcoRI fragment derived from a nisin resistance plasmid, pSF01, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pVS34 to obtain a nisin-chloramphenicol double-resistance plasmid, pVS39. From this plasmid, the streptococcal chloramphenicol resistance region was subsequently eliminated. The resulting plasmid, pVS40, contains only lactococcal DNA. Potential uses for this type of a nisin resistance plasmid are discussed.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic whey in relation to bacterial association with mastitis.
AB  - The growth of mastitis pathogens (eight strains) and non-pathogenic bacteria (eight strains) was studied using microturbidometry. All bacteria grew well in whey originating from uninflamed quarters. However, the growth of bacteria which are not considered to be mastitis pathogens (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) became suppressed by whey from mastitic quarters. On the contrary, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was generally better in mastitic samples. Streptococcus agalactiae showed inconsistent results.
TI  - Preincubation time and the use of oxygen indicators in determining the microbiological quality of aseptically packed pea and tomato soup.
AB  - In order to get accurate information about the preincubation time needed for viscous aseptic products, the growth characteristics of three food poisoning organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus in pea soup, and one spoilage organism, Lactobacillus plantarum, in tomato soup, were followed during a preincubation period at 30 degrees C for 14 days. The sterile food packs were sealed into polyamidepolyethylene laminate bags containing different headspace gas concentrations (21% oxygen + 80% nitrogen, 5% oxygen + 95% nitrogen and 100% nitrogen). Bacterial growth was followed every second day by counting the number of colony forming units and following the headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. The bacterial strains differed in their growth characteristics, especially in their ability to consume oxygen from the headspace, and also in their ability to produce carbon dioxide. The headspace oxygen concentration was also followed by oxygen indicators in order to determine the correlation with the oxygen concentration of the headspace and the growth of bacteria. The bacterial growth followed more closely the concentration of carbon dioxide than the concentration of oxygen. It was concluded that further studies are needed to determine the preincubation period for viscous aseptic products in order to furnish accurate data on the growth characteristics of low numbers of bacteria in aseptic foods at different headspace gas compositions.
TI  - Biosynthesis of linkage units for teichoic acids in gram-positive bacteria: distribution of related enzymes and their specificities for UDP-sugars and lipid-linked intermediates.
AB  - The distribution and substrate specificities of enzymes involved in the formation of linkage units which contain N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) or glucose and join teichoic acid chains to peptidoglycan were studied among membrane systems obtained from the following two groups of gram-positive bacteria: group A, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus plantarum; group B, Bacillus coagulans. All the membrane preparations tested catalyzed the synthesis of N-acetylglucosaminyl pyrophosphorylpolyprenol (GlcNAc-PP-polyprenol). The enzymes transferring glycosyl residues to GlcNAc-PP-polyprenol were specific to either UDP-ManNAc (group A strains) or UDP-glucose (group B strains). In the synthesis of the disaccharide-bound lipids, GlcNAc-PP-dolichol could substitute for GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol. ManNAc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol, ManNAc-GlcNAc-PP-dolichol, Glc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol, Glc-GlcNAc-PP-dolichol, and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol were more or less efficiently converted to glycerol phosphate-containing lipid intermediates and polymers in the membrane systems of B. subtilis W23 and B. coagulans AHU 1366. However, GlcNAc-GlcNAc-PP-dolichol could not serve as an intermediate in either of these membrane systems. Further studies on the exchangeability of ManNAc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol and Glc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol revealed that in the membrane systems of S. aureus strains and other B. coagulans strains both disaccharide-inked lipids served almost equally as intermediates in the synthesis of polymers. In the membrane systems of other B. subtilis strains as well as B. licheniformis and B. pumilus strains, however, the replacement of ManNAc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol by Glc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol led to a great accumulation of (glycerol phosphate)-Glc-GlcNAc-PP-undecaprenol accompanied by a decrease in the formation of polymers.
TI  - Effect of environmental conditions during soya-bean fermentation on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and production and thermal stability of enterotoxins A and B.
AB  - During tempe manufacture, Staphylococcus aureus was able to survive in newly started soya-bean soaks (final pH 4.7), whereas it died during soaks with accelerated souring (final pH 4.0). No S. aureus were detected after subsequent heat treatment of soaked beans. S. aureus strain S6 could produce enterotoxins A and B if inoculated on cooked soya-beans. Its growth and enterotoxin production were not influenced by inoculation rate nor by the presence of actively growing Rhizopus oligosporus, the fungus responsible for tempe formation. Enterotoxin levels were highest after 48 h fermentation. Presence of lactobacilli (L. brevis or L. plantarum) during the tempe fermentation did not influence staphylococcal growth, but enterotoxin levels were reduced. Reduced oxygen pressure did not affect staphylococcal growth, but resulted in lower enterotoxin levels after 48 h incubation. The thermal stability of enterotoxin A in tempe was significantly lower than in Brain Heart Infusion broth of comparable pH. Heating of enterotoxin-containing tempe mash reduced enterotoxin A by 99.7% as measured with ELISA and animal feeding methods.
TI  - Influence of lactic starter inoculation, curd heating and ripening temperature on Staphylococcus aureus behaviour in Manchego cheese.
AB  - Growth and survival of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in 52 lots of raw  ewe's milk Manchego cheese manufactured and ripened under different conditions. A 5.8-fold reduction in S. aureus counts after 60 days of ripening was obtained by inoculating milk with 1% Streptococcus lactis culture, and a further 2.0-fold reduction could be achieved by adding 0.1% Lactobacillus plantarum culture. Curd heating temperature had a significant effect on S. aureus survival, with counts 4-5 times lower in cheese from 30 degrees C curd than in cheese from curd heated at 36-40 degrees C. Ripening temperature was the parameter with the greatest influence on S. aureus counts, which reached in cheese cured at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days levels 10 and 100 times lower, respectively, than in cheese held at 5 degrees C.
TI  - Activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  - Cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group A type of Schleifer and Kandler's classification, with one exception (Arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. The complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group B type peptidoglycan, except those of Corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group A type peptidoglycan. Preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. A water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (SEPS), which was prepared from Staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. A peptidoglycan "monomer," SEPS-M, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of SEPS with endo-N-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. In conformity with this finding, neither synthetic N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) nor MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala activated the complement cascade. Among several lipophilic derivatives of MDP, 6-O-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala (BH48-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala) and 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDP (B30-MDP) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through the classical pathway, respectively. The finding that a D-isoasparagine analog of B30-MDP caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the activation of complement by B30-MDP is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.
TI  - Antibacterially active substituted anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids.
AB  - Anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity. While these anilides were ineffective against Gram-negative organisms, there was a good correlation between chemical structure and biological activity against Gram-positive species. Both the nature and position of the benzene ring substituents and the length of the carbon side chain affected the activity and specificity of the compounds. The highest activity was observed when the acyl or sulfuryl moiety had a C7-C9 side chain attached. The CONH and SO2NH bridging groups were equally effective. The attachment of COOH or COOCH3 groups in the omega-position did not effect activity, but the substitution of the acidic proton of the sulfonamide group by an alkyl group rendered the compound inactive. Six compounds, which were substituted anilides of sulfonic acids, fatty acids, or the analagous alpha-methylene-substituted acids, were bacteriostatic at 10 ppm against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus plantarum. One of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-5-nitroanilide of alpha-methylenedecanoic acid, was bactericidal at 1 ppm.
TI  - On the relationship between glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria. II. Structures of glycerophosphoglycolipids.
AB  - 1. Eight glycerophosphoglycolipids were isolated from six Gram-positive bacteria. Besides sn-glycero-1-phospho-beta-gentiobiosyldiacylglycerol (i) and sn-glycero-1-phospho-alpha-kojibiosyldiacylglycerol (ii), three novel structures have been established: 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (iii), 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]glycerol (iv), and 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (v). 2. Compound i was isolated from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, compound ii from a group B Streptococcus, compounds ii and iii from Streptococcus lactis, compounds iv and v from Lactobacillus casei. Lactobacillus plantarum contained besides compounds iv and v a glycerophosphate derivative of 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[alpha-D-galactopyranosyl (1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]glycerol. 3. Identical structural features of the described glycerophosphoglycolipids and the corresponding lipoteichoic acids are discussed.
TI  - Structural requirements for arthritogenicity of peptidoglycans from Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plant arum and analogous synthetic compounds.
AB  - The comparative studies on the arthritogenicity of chemically well defined peptidoglycans (PG)2 from the cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus (FDA 209P) and Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014) showed that 1) a polymer of disaccharide-peptide with or without the presence of N-acetylglucosaminyl-ribitol-teichoic acid produced severe arthritis; 2) oligosaccharide-peptides with or without the special structure (N-acetylglucosaminyl-ribitol-teichoic acid in S. aureus, a polymer of rhamnose and glucose in L. plantarum) produced severe disease; 3) disaccharide-heptapeptide-disaccharide with or without the presence of either glucose-ribitol-teichoic acid or a polymer of rhamnose and glucose appeared to be arthritogenic but much less effective for disease production; 4) N-acetylmuramyl-heptapeptide-N-acetylmuramic acid and disaccharide-hexapeptide were non-arthritogenic; 5) none of the synthetic N-acetylmuramyl-peptides, including tetrapeptide, produced the disease. Thus it is concluded that arthritis-inducing activity is related to the peptidoglycan moiety but not to the special structure, and the most important moiety responsible for disease production may be located in a chain length of two or more disaccharide units on PG subunits. However, it is discussed that non-arthritogenicity of peptidoglycans, including synthetic compounds, may be due to a lack of adjuvanticity in rats rather than a lack of antigenic determinant(s) responsible for production of arthritis.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of peptidoglycan subunits from the cell walls of Staphyloccus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Attempts were made to isolate and identify the unit chemical structure essential  for manifestation of the immunoadjuvant activities characteristic of bacterial cell walls. The N-acetylmuramyl-peptide subunit monomers, Nalpha-(N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl)-Nepsilon-(glycylglycyl)-L-lysyl -D-alanine from the cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus (FDA 209P) and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid and/or N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-meso-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine from those of Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), were shown to be unit chemical entities with definite adjuvant activity both in stimulation of antibody production and in induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Mode of action of glycine on the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.
AB  - The mechanism of glycine action in growth inhibition was studied on eight different species of bacteria of various genera representing the four most common peptidoglycan types. To inhibit the growth of the different organisms to 80%, glycine concentrations from 0.05 to 1.33 M had to be applied. The inhibited cells showed morphological aberrations. It has been demonstrated that glycine is incorporated into the nucleotide-activated peptidoglycan precursors. The amount of incorporated glycine was equivalent to the decrease in the amount of alanine. With one exception glycine is also incorporated into the peptidoglycan. Studies on the primary structure of both the peptidoglycan precursors and the corresponding peptidoglycan have revealed that glycine can replace l-alanine in position 1 and d-alanine residues in positions 4 and 5 of the peptide subunit. Replacement of l-alanine in position 1 of the peptide subunit together with an accumulation of uridine diphosphate-muramic acid (UDP-MurNAc), indicating an inhibition of the UDP-MurNAc:l-Ala ligase, has been found in three bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus and L. plantarum). However, discrimination against precursors with glycine in position 1 in peptidoglycan synthesis has been observed only in S. aureus. Replacement of d-alanine residues was most common. It occurred in the peptidoglycan with one exception in all strains studied. In Corynebacterium sp., C. callunae, L. plantarum, and L. cellobiosus most of the d-alanine replacing glycine occurs C-terminal in position 4, and in C. insidiosum and S. aureus glycine is found C-terminal in position 5. It is suggested that the modified peptidoglycan precursors are accumulated by being poor substrates for some of the enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Two mechanisms leading to a more loosely cross-linked peptidoglycan and to morphological changes of the cells are considered. First, the accumulation of glycine-containing precursors may lead to a disrupture of the normal balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis during growth. Second, the modified glycine-containing precursors may be incorporated. Since these are poor substrates in the transpeptidation reaction, a high percentage of muropeptides remains uncross-linked. The second mechanism may be the more significant in most cases.
TI  - Inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
AB  - Streightoff, Frank (The Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, Ind.). Inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. J. Bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-Several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-FNA) have been demonstrated to inhibit Streptococcus sp. (Viridans group), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus plantarum in vitro. The most active compounds were 5-FNA and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-FNAM). The growth of Streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-FNA or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-FNAM. The inhibition of Streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-FNA or 5-FNAM was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. The inhibition of E. coli from 100 parts of 5-FNA or 5-FNAM was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. Inhibitions by most other active compounds could be reversed by nicotinic acid. In experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-FNA had activity against Streptococcus pyogenes; 5-FNA, 5-FNAM, and 5-fluoro-N-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. The action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-FNA was reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. The activity of 5-FNA was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.
