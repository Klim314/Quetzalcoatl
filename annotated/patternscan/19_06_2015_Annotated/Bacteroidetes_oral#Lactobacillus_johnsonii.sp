TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == gram-negative bacteria aggravate murine small intestinal th1-type immunopathology following oral infection with toxoplasma gondii.
AB  == oral infection of susceptible mice with toxoplasma gondii results in th1-type immunopathology in the ileum. we investigated gut flora changes during ileitis and determined contributions of gut bacteria to intestinal inflammation. analysis of the intestinal microflora revealed that ileitis was accompanied by increasing  bacterial load, decreasing species diversity, and bacterial translocation. gram-negative bacteria identified as escherichia coli and bacteroides/prevotella  spp. accumulated in inflamed ileum at high concentrations. prophylactic or therapeutic administration of ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole ameliorated ileal immunopathology and reduced intestinal no and ifn-gamma levels. most strikingly, gnotobiotic mice in which cultivable gut bacteria were removed by quintuple antibiotic treatment did not develop ileitis after toxoplasma gondii infection. a reduction in total numbers of lymphocytes was observed in the lamina propria of specific pathogen-free (spf), but not gnotobiotic, mice upon development of ileitis. relative numbers of cd4(+) t cells did not differ in naive vs infected gnotobiotic or spf mice, but infected spf mice showed a significant increase in the frequencies of activated cd4(+) t cells compared with gnotobiotic mice. furthermore, recolonization with total gut flora, e. coli, or bacteroides/prevotella spp., but not lactobacillus johnsonii, induced immunopathology in gnotobiotic mice. animals recolonized with e. coli and/or total gut flora, but not l. johnsonii, showed elevated ileal no and/or ifn-gamma  levels. in conclusion, gram-negative bacteria, i.e., e. coli, aggravate pathogen-induced intestinal th1-type immunopathology. thus, pathogen-induced acute ileitis may prove useful to study bacteria-host interactions in small intestinal inflammation and to test novel therapies based on modulation of gut flora.
