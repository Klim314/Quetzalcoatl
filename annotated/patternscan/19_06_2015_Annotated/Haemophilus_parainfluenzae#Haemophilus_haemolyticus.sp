TI  == genital carriage of the genus haemophilus in pregnancy: species distribution and  antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == recent reports have hypothesized that colonization of the maternal genital tract  with noncapsulated h. influenzae could result in neonatal invasive disease. in this study, genital carriage of the genus haemophilus was investigated in 510 pregnant women attending an italian hospital for routine controls. overall, vaginal carriage of the genus haemophilus was 9.0% (46/510). a high colonization  rate with h. parainfluenzae (37/510, 7.3%) was found; other species, such as h. pittmaniae (7/510, 1.4%) and h. haemolyticus (2/510, 0.4%), were detected for the first time in the genital flora by 16s rrna gene sequencing. notably, no h. influenzae was identified in agreement with previous investigations indicating that this species is rarely isolated from the genitourinary tract of pregnant women. no antibiotic resistance was detected in h. pittmaniae and h. haemolyticus, but quite a high degree of ampicillin (10/37, 27%) and ciprofloxacin (3/37, 8.1%) resistance was observed in h. parainfluenzae. five ampicillin-resistant isolates were beta-lactamase producers whereas 5 isolates exhibited a beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) phenotype. sequencing of penicillin-binding protein (pbp)3 revealed that the val511ala, asn526ser, ala530ser and thr574ala changes were associated with blnar phenotypes. two ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates carried substitutions in both gyra (ser84phe and asp88tyr) and parc (ser84tyr and met198leu), the other ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate had substitutions in parc, only (ser138thr and met198leu). in conclusions, about ten per cent of pregnant women carried a species of haemophilus in their genital tract. the emergence of non-beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in genital h. parainfluenzae is a matter of concern because of the risk of mother-to-baby transmission.

TI  == difficulties in species identification within the genus haemophilus - a pilot study addressing a significant problem for routine diagnostics.
AB  == diagnostic misidentifications of commensalic haemophilus haemolyticus as pathogenic haemophilus influenzae are frequent. this pilot study evaluates whether isolations of h. haemolyticus are frequent enough in germany to cause a relevant diagnostic problem, considering the fact that even h. influenzae is a mere colonizer in about 30% of isolations. in microbiological laboratories of two hospitals located in northern and southern germany, the distribution of haemophilus spp. was analyzed during a six-month-period. site of infection, sex,  and age of the patients was taken into consideration. a total of 77 haemophilus spp. isolates was acquired and discriminated on species level, comprising: 48 h.  influenzae, 25 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 h. haemolyticus, and 1 haemophilus parahaemolyticus. the proportion of h. haemolyticus was calculated to range between 1.2% and 16.2 % within the 95% confidence limits. commensalic haemophilus spp. were isolated from oropharynx-associated sites only. h. influenzae, in contrast, was detected in clinically relevant materials like lower respiratory materials and conjunctiva swabs. altogether, there was a low proportion of clinical h. haemolyticus isolates. accordingly, the problem of unnecessary antibiotic therapies due to misidentifications of h. haemolyticus as h. influenzae is quantitatively negligible compared with the risk of confusing h. influenzae colonizations with infections.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis reveals distinct genotypic features of the emerging  pathogen haemophilus influenzae type f.
AB  == background: the incidence of invasive disease caused by encapsulated haemophilus  influenzae type f (hif) has increased in the post-h. influenzae type b (hib) vaccine era. we previously annotated the first complete hif genome from a clinical isolate (kr494) that caused septic shock and necrotizing myositis. here, the full genome of hif kr494 was compared to sequenced reference strains hib 10810, capsule type d (hid) rd kw20, and finally nontypeable h. influenzae 3655.  the goal was to identify possible genomic characteristics that may shed light upon the pathogenesis of hif. results: the hif kr494 genome exhibited large regions of synteny with other h. influenzae, but also distinct genome rearrangements. a predicted hif core genome of 1390 genes was shared with the reference strains, and 6 unique genomic regions comprising half of the 191 unique coding sequences were revealed. the majority of these regions were inserted genetic fragments, most likely derived from the closely-related haemophilus spp.  including h. aegyptius, h. haemolyticus and h. parainfluenzae. importantly, the kr494 genome possessed several putative virulence genes that were distinct from non-type f strains. these included the sap2 operon, aef3 fimbriae, and genes for  kanamycin nucleotidyltranserase, iron-utilization proteins, and putative yada-like trimeric autotransporters that may increase the bacterial virulence. furthermore, hif kr494 lacked a hisabcdefgh operon for de novo histidine biosynthesis, hmg locus for lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation, the haemophilus antibiotic resistance island and a haemophilus secondary molybdate transport system. we confirmed the histidine auxotrophy and kanamycin resistance in hif by functional experiments. moreover, the pattern of unique or missing genes of hif kr494 was similar in 20 hif clinical isolates obtained from different years and geographical areas. a cross-species comparison  revealed that the hif genome shared more characteristics with h. aegyptius than hid and nthi. conclusions: the genomic comparative analyses facilitated identification of genotypic characteristics that may be related to the specific virulence of hif. in relation to non-type f h. influenzae strains, the hif genome contains differences in components involved in metabolism and survival that may contribute to its invasiveness.

TI  == an application of outer membrane protein p6-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay for detection of haemophilus influenzae in middle ear fluids and nasopharyngeal secretions.
AB  == an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to outer membrane protein p6 (p6-elisa) was applied for detecting haemophilus influenzae in middle ear fluids  (mefs) from acute otitis media (aom) patients and in nasopharyngeal secretions (npss) from acute rhinosinusitis patients. p6-elisa had a sensitivity of 83.3% for mefs and 71.5% for npss and a specificity of 85.6% for mefs and 92.5% for npss, respectively. real-time pcr exhibited significant differences in the number of ompp1 gene copies among samples determined by p6-elisa to be positive and negative for h. influenzae. however, because the p6-elisa test has the reactivity in haemophilus species include two commensals h. haemolyticus and h. parainfluenzae, it is thus a weak method in order to detect only nthi correctly.  consequently, diagnosis using the p6-elisa should be based on an overall evaluation, including the results of other related examinations and clinical symptoms to prevent misleading conclusions in clinical setting.

TI  == rapid discrimination of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. haemolyticus by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and two matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) platforms.
AB  == background: due to considerable differences in pathogenicity, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. haemolyticus have to be reliably discriminated in routine diagnostics. retrospective analyses suggest frequent misidentifications of commensal h. haemolyticus as h. influenzae. in a multi-center approach, we assessed the suitability of fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) for the identification of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. haemolyticus to species level. methodology:  a strain collection of 84 haemophilus spp. comprising 50 h. influenzae, 25 h. parainfluenzae, 7 h. haemolyticus, and 2 h. parahaemolyticus including 77 clinical isolates was analyzed by fish with newly designed dna probes, and two different maldi-tof-ms systems (bruker, shimadzu) with and without prior formic acid extraction. principal findings: among the 84 haemophilus strains analyzed, fish led to 71 correct results (85%), 13 uninterpretable results (15%), and no misidentifications. shimadzu maldi-tof-ms resulted in 59 correct identifications  (70%), 19 uninterpretable results (23%), and 6 misidentifications (7%), using colony material applied directly. bruker maldi-tof-ms with prior formic acid extraction led to 74 correct results (88%), 4 uninterpretable results (5%) and 6  misidentifications (7%). the bruker maldi-tof-ms misidentifications could be resolved by the addition of a suitable h. haemolyticus reference spectrum to the  system's database. in conclusion, no analyzed diagnostic procedure was free of errors. diagnostic results have to be interpreted carefully and alternative tests should be applied in case of ambiguous test results on isolates from seriously ill patients.

TI  == haemophilus species
AB  == the genus haemophilus includes a number of species that cause a wide variety of infections but share a common morphology and a requirement for blood-derived factors during growth that has given the genus its name. haemophilus influenzae,  the major pathogen, can be separated into encapsulated or typable strains, of which there are seven types (a through f including e') based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide, and unencapsulated or nontypable strains. type b h influenzae is by far the most virulent organism in this group,  commonly causing bloodstream invasion and meningitis in children younger than 2 years. nontypable strains are frequent causes of respiratory tract disease in infants, children, and adults. other haemophilus species cause disease less frequently. haemophilus parainfluenzae sometimes causes pneumonia or bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. haemophilus aphrophilus is a  member of the normal flora of the mouth and occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus aegyptius, which causes conjunctivitis and brazilian purpuric fever, and haemophilus haemolyticus used to be separated on the basis of their ability to agglutinate or lyse red blood cells, but both are now included among the nontypable h influenzae strains.

TI  == antimicrobial characterisation of cem-101 activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serogroup 19a isolates.
AB  == cem-101 is a novel fluorinated macrolide-ketolide with potent activity against bacterial pathogens that are susceptible or resistant to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b))-ketolide agents. cem-101 is being  developed for oral and parenteral use in moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. the objective of this study was to assess the activity of cem-101 and comparators against contemporary respiratory tract infection (rti) isolates. a worldwide sample of organisms was used, including streptococcus pneumoniae [n=168; 59.3% erythromycin-resistant and 18 multidrug-resistant (mdr) serogroup 19a strains], moraxella catarrhalis (n=21; 11 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus influenzae (n=100; 48 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus haemolyticus (n=12), and legionella pneumophila (n=30). testing and interpretation were performed using reference clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. cem-101 was very potent against s. pneumoniae [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic90)=0.25 mg/l; highest mic at 0.5 mg/l] and was 2- and > or =32-fold more active than telithromycin and clindamycin, respectively. cem-101 also demonstrated potent activity against s. pneumoniae mdr-19a strains (mic90=0.5 mg/l). cem-101 was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested against  l. pneumophila, with all mic values at < or = 0.015 mg/l (telithromycin mic90=0.03 mg/l). cem-101 was as potent as azithromycin against haemophilus spp.  rti pathogens (mic90=2 mg/l), with no variations for beta-lactamase production. cem-101 mic values against m. catarrhalis were all at < or =0.5mg/l. interestingly, cem-101 potency was ca. 6 log(2) dilutions greater than telithromycin mic results among 44 beta-haemolytic streptococci having telithromycin mics > or = 2 mg/l. cem-101 exhibited the greatest potency and widest spectrum of activity against rti pathogens among the tested mls(b)-ketolide agents (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) and was comparable overall with levofloxacin.

TI  == delineation of the species haemophilus influenzae by phenotype, multilocus sequence phylogeny, and detection of marker genes.
AB  == to obtain more information on the much-debated definition of prokaryotic species, we investigated the borders of haemophilus influenzae by comparative analysis of  h. influenzae reference strains with closely related bacteria including strains assigned to haemophilus haemolyticus, cryptic genospecies biotype iv, and the never formally validated species "haemophilus intermedius". multilocus sequence phylogeny based on six housekeeping genes separated a cluster encompassing the type and the reference strains of h. influenzae from 31 more distantly related strains. comparison of 16s rrna gene sequences supported this delineation but was obscured by a conspicuously high number of polymorphic sites in many of the strains that did not belong to the core group of h. influenzae strains. the division was corroborated by the differential presence of genes encoding h. influenzae adhesion and penetration protein, fuculokinase, and cu,zn-superoxide dismutase, whereas immunoglobulin a1 protease activity or the presence of the iga gene was of limited discriminatory value. the existence of porphyrin-synthesizing strains ("h. intermedius") closely related to h. influenzae was confirmed. several chromosomally encoded hemin biosynthesis genes were identified, and sequence analysis showed these genes to represent an ancestral genotype rather than recent transfers from, e.g., haemophilus parainfluenzae. strains previously  assigned to h. haemolyticus formed several separate lineages within a distinct but deeply branching cluster, intermingled with strains of "h. intermedius" and cryptic genospecies biotype iv. although h. influenzae is phenotypically more homogenous than some other haemophilus species, the genetic diversity and multicluster structure of strains traditionally associated with h. influenzae make it difficult to define the natural borders of that species.

TI  == phylogeny of the genus haemophilus as determined by comparison of partial infb sequences.
AB  == a 453 bp fragment of infb, the gene encoding translation initiation factor 2, was sequenced and compared from 66 clinical isolates and type strains of haemophilus  species and related bacteria. analysis of the partial infb sequences obtained suggested that the human isolates dependent on x and v factor, h. influenzae, h.  haemolyticus, h. aegyptius and some cryptic genospecies of h. influenzae, were closely related to each other. h. parainfluenzae constituted a heterogeneous group within the boundaries of the genus, whereas h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were only remotely related to the type species of the genus haemophilus h. parahaemolyticus and h. paraphrohaemolyticus  took up an intermediary position and may not belong in the genus haemophilus sensu stricto. ambiguous results were obtained with seven isolates tentatively identified as h. segnis, which fell into two discrete clusters. the delineation of 'haemophilus sensu stricto' as suggested by infb analysis supports previous results obtained by dna hybridization, in contrast to the delineation inferred from 16s rrna sequence comparison.

TI  == an investigation into the influences of species and biotype on the type of iga1 protease produced by isolates of haemophilus.
AB  == a total of 59 isolates of different haemophilus spp., mostly from clinical specimens, was characterised, biotyped and examined for production of type 1 or type 2 iga1 protease. iga1 protease activity was not found in any isolate of a species with no or low virulence for man including h. parainfluenzae, h. haemolyticus, h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, h. paraphrohaemolyticus and h. haemoglobinophilus. iga1 protease was produced by all isolates of h. influenzae and h. aegyptius and by some isolates of h. parahaemolyticus. the type of iga1 protease appeared to be independent of the biotype of the isolate in h. influenzae. for the first time some isolates of h. aegyptius were found that produced type 2 iga1 protease. iga1 protease production in h. parahaemolyticus may be associated with the virulence of the isolate.

TI  == development of a haemophilus two-dimensional protein database.
AB  == members of the haemophilus genus are responsible for various human infections including respiratory infections and meningitis. the complete nucleotide sequence of the rd strain of haemophilus influenzae has been reported and represents a valuable resource to investigate gene expression within this bacterial group. we  described previously the application of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-d page) to characterise the proteins of haemophilus influenzae (cash et al., electrophoresis 1995, 16, 135-148). we have extended these data with comparative studies of the proteins from other members of the haemophilus genus (specifically h. parainfluenzae, h. haemolyticus and h. parahaemolyticus) to identify homologous proteins and, by extension, the genes encoding them, among these bacteria. the proteins extracted from each of these bacterial isolates were compared by coelectrophoresis to the 2-d protein profile of the reference nontypable strain of h. influenzae (hi-64443) used as the basis for the 2-d protein database. a composite reference 2-d protein profile of hi-64443 was derived from three independent analyses of the soluble bacterial proteins. between 21% and 37% of the hi-64443 proteins from the reference 2-d protein profile comigrated with proteins in the other isolates from the haemophilus genus. this compared with 62% and 64% comigration when hi-64443 was compared with the eagan and rd strains of h. influenzae, respectively. the 2-d protein profile  of the rd strain of h. influenzae was compared to that of hi-64443 by coelectrophoresis; 64% of the proteins detected for the rd strain comigrated with proteins found for hi-64443 when analysed in parallel. the capacity of 2-d page to investigate global interactions of gene expression was applied to the analysis of superoxide dismutase (sod) expression in h. influenzae strain eagan. a "knock-out" mutant in the soda gene which encodes [mn]-sod was characterised with respect to protein synthesis compared to the parental isolate. from these analyses, the primary product of soda was provisionally identified as a protein with a molecular mass of 25500 da and an estimated pi of 6.55. quantitative changes in the expression of two other proteins in the sod mutant were detected by comparison with the parental isolate. these data are discussed in relation to  the development of a 2-d protein database for h. influenzae and related bacteria  to investigate genome homologies and gene expression.

TI  == binding of human hemoglobin by haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == binding of biotinylated human hemoglobin to haemophilus influenzae was detected when organisms were grown in heme-deplete, but not heme-replete, conditions. hemoglobin binding was completely inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled human hemoglobin or human hemoglobin complexed with human haptoglobin. binding was only partially inhibited by rat hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, human globin,  and bovine globin, and not at all by heme, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human transferrin, or myoglobin. hemoglobin binding was saturable at 16-20 ng of hemoglobin per 10(9) cfu. binding of human hemoglobin was detected in serotypes a-f and serologically non-typable strains of h. influenzae, as well as  haemophilus haemolyticus but not haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus parahaemolyticus, or escherichia coli.

TI  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in haemophilus species.
AB  == copper-zinc superoxide dismutases ([cu,zn]-sods) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes but have rarely been found in prokaryotes. a gene for [cu,zn]-sod (sodc) has recently been cloned from haemophilus influenzae type b and h. parainfluenzae, so other haemophilus and related species were screened for the presence of [cu,zn]-sods by visualization of bands of sod activity in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and  by gene probing. strains of h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, some non-typable h. influenzae, h. haemoglobinophilus (canis) and h. parasuis were all found to have [cu,zn]-sod activity (inhibited by 2 mm-cyanide) in polyacrylamide gels. in a southern blot analysis, dna from h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, h. haemolyticus and [cu,zn]-sod-containing non-typable h. influenzae--but not the other species--hybridized to a 360 nucleotide dna probe containing the 5'-part of sodc cloned from h. influenzae type b. bacterial [cu,zn]-sods are more prevalent than has previously been recognized.

TI  == phylogeny of 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae as determined by comparison of 16s rrna sequences.
AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

TI  == distribution of protein d, an immunoglobulin d-binding protein, in haemophilus strains.
AB  == protein d, a novel surface protein of the bacterial species haemophilus influenzae with specific affinity for human immunoglobulin (ig) d was detected in all 127 h. influenzae strains studied. all strains representing different serotypes of encapsulated strains and different biotypes of nonencapsulated strains bound 125i-labeled igd to a high degree (38 to 74%). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that protein d from all h. influenzae strains had the same apparent molecular weight (i.e., 42,000) and reacted with all three different anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies. by scatchard analysis, the number of protein d residues  on a nontypeable h. influenzae strain was estimated to be approximately 2,800 per organism. the equilibrium constant for the reaction between a human igd myeloma protein and igd was found to be 5.8 x 10(8) m-1. also, all strains of h. haemolyticus and h. aegypticus strains tested bound igd, 21 to 28% and 41 to 48%, respectively. in extracts of those bacteria, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein reactive with igd and all three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies was found. in h. parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein that was reactive with one to three of three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies but not reactive with  human igd was detected with western blot analysis. other haemophilus species (h.  ducreyi, h. parasuis, h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. haemoglobinophilus)  did not react with human monoclonal igd or anti-protein d antibodies. on the basis of the wide distribution of protein d among h. influenzae strains, we suggest that protein d could be a vaccine candidate.

TI  == detection of haemophilus influenzae in cerebrospinal fluids by polymerase chain reaction dna amplification.
AB  == two primer sets were chosen for the detection of haemophilus influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna amplification. one primer set was selected from sequences encoding a capsulation-associated protein  and reacted with target dna from all 15 capsulate h. influenzae strains (all serotypes) examined. the other primer set was selected from the dna sequence of a gene encoding for outer-membrane protein p6 and reacted with the 15 capsulate and 10 non-capsulate strains of h. influenzae tested. this primer set also reacted with the closely related species h. haemolyticus and h. aegyptius, and with two of nine h. parainfluenzae strains. in reconstruction experiments, pcr dna amplification was able to detect as few as five h. influenzae cells when 40 cycles of amplification were used. two hundred cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples  collected consecutively from patients suffering from meningitis were investigated by pcr; 40 were culture-positive for h. influenzae and 39 of these were also clearly positive in the pcr test with both primer sets. contamination occurred to some extent with 40 cycles of amplification but was completely eliminated when the number of cycles was reduced to 35. we conclude that the two primer sets are  appropriate for the detection of h. influenzae by pcr, each having its own specificity. when these two primer sets are used, pcr is a technique of equivalent sensitivity to culture for the detection of h. influenzae in csf.

TI  == utilization of transferrin-bound iron by haemophilus species of human and porcine origins.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae and h. haemolyticus acquired iron bound to human transferrin but not to human lactoferrin, ovo- or porcine transferrins. conversely the swine pathogens h. pleuropneumoniae and h. parasuis used iron bound only to porcine transferrin. growth under conditions of iron deprivation induced the production of siderophores and iron-repressible outer membrane proteins in h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus and h. parasuis but not in h. influenzae, h. haemolyticus or h. pleuropneumoniae. the latter 3 haemophilus species appear to sequester transferrin bound iron via a siderophore-independent  mechanism. however, the ability to produce iron chelating compounds did not enable h. parainfluenzae or h. paraphrophilus to utilize transferrin bound iron.

TI  == nonculture detection of haemophilus influenzae in sputum with monoclonal antibodies specific for outer membrane lipoprotein p6.
AB  == isolation of haemophilus influenzae from sputum is hampered by overgrowth by other microorganisms or by antibiotic treatment of the patient. to overcome this  problem in the detection of h. influenzae, an in situ immunoperoxidase staining technique was developed with monoclonal antibody (mab) 8bd9, immunoglobulin subclass g2a. mab 8bd9 appeared to be directed to an epitope on the outer membrane lipoprotein p6 of h. influenzae. the species specificity of mab 8bd9 was analyzed by staining isolates from different bacterial species. mab 8bd9 reacted  with all 300 h. influenzae strains tested and with h. aegyptius and h. haemolyticus. twenty-six of 30 h. parainfluenzae strains, other haemophilus species, and other bacterial species often isolated from sputum were not stained. the staining technique was compared with culture of 845 routinely obtained sputum samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. in 829 sputa (98.1%), the results of both techniques were in agreement; 173 were positive for h. influenzae, and 656 were negative. with 14 sputum samples, the staining method gave a positive result for h. influenzae, but the bacterium was not cultured. this could be ascribed to antibiotic treatment of the patient (n = 7), the presence of other mab 8bd9-positive haemophilus species in the sputum (n = 5), and overgrowth by swarming proteus mirabilis or by branhamella catarrhalis. in the immunoperoxidase- and gram-stained smears of two sputum samples, no bacteria  were seen, although some h. influenzae was cultured. on the basis of these results, we conclude that immunoperoxidase staining with mab 8bd9 is a fast and reliable extension of the available detection techniques for h. influenzae.

AB  == several reports have described the high frequency of pharyngeal isolation of haemophilus species. few studies have compared the simultaneous isolation rate of this species in the oropharyngeal and anogenital areas. using two selective media, heart infusion agar (hia) supplemented with 5% defibrinated rabbit blood,  1% isovitalex, and either bacitracin alone (100 micrograms/ml) or bacitracin (5 micrograms/ml), vancomycin (3 micrograms/ml), and polymyxin b (1 microgram/ml), we isolated haemophilus species in both areas in 89 of 399 (22.2%) patients consulting a sexually transmitted disease clinic. of those, 56 were males and 33  were females. we recovered haemophilus species in the oropharyngeal area in 384 patients (96%), while rectal and genital areas were colonized in 48 (12.0%) and 55 (13.8%) patients, respectively (both areas were colonized in 14 patients). haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated almost twice as often in the anogenital area as was h. influenzae. h. influenzae biotypes ii and iii and h. haemolyticus  were the more prevalent xv-requiring haemophili isolated from the oropharynx, while h. influenzae biotype iv was more prevalent in the anogenital area. h. parainfluenzae biotypes i, ii, and iii were more prevalent in the oropharynx, while biotypes i and ii were more prevalent in the anogenital area.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup, a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results are summarized as follows. 1. plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates after  oral administration on fasting of rkm dry syrup at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg to 2 and 1 cases, respectively, were determined. peak plasma levels were obtained in 30 minutes after administration of both dosages with half-lives of 1.5 to 2.2  hours. a clear-cut dose response was observed. urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 1.75 to 2.26%. 2. the mics of rkm  against 80 clinical isolates (streptococcus pyogenes 9, streptococcus pneumoniae  14, branhamella catarrhalis 4, haemophilus influenzae 27, haemophilus parainfluenzae 9, haemophilus haemolyticus 2, haemophilus parahaemolyticus 14 and campylobacter jejuni 1) were compared with mics of midecamycin acetate (mom), josamycin (jm) and erythromycin (em). the antibacterial activity of rkm was superior to those of mom and jm and slightly inferior to that of em. 3. twenty-eight pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (acute tonsillitis 4, streptococcal infection 4, acute bronchitis 9, pneumonia 4, mycoplasmal pneumonia 2 and campylobacter enteritis 5) were treated with rkm dry syrup at a daily dose of 12-42.9 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. efficacy rates were 92.9% clinically and 58.6% bacteriologically. 4. no adverse reactions were observed. abnormal laboratory findings were mild; thrombocytosis in 2 and eosinophilia in 1. 5. the taste and the odor of rkm dry syrup preparation were sufficiently tolerable for the pediatric patients to accept it.

TI  == clinical evaluation of the vitek neisseria-haemophilus identification card.
AB  == a clinical evaluation of the vitek neisseria-haemophilus identification (nhi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. identifications obtained with the nhi card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. the card identified 83.2% of 244 neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. some isolates  produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications  and extra tests were required and suggested. when isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the nhi card identified 99.1% of 110 n. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 n. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 h. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 h. parainfluenzae strains. all of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for h. influenzae biotypes ii, iii, and vii, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from h. haemolyticus. the nhi card reliably identified other  fastidious gram-negative species, including h. aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens,  gardnerella vaginalis, and kingella denitrificans.

TI  == characterisation of haemophilus spp. isolated from infant conjunctivitis.
AB  == haemophilus strains isolated from children under the age of 11 months with conjunctivitis were characterised by biotype, sugar fermentation, plasmid pattern and outer-membrane-protein profiles. h. influenzae was the most common species identified and was separated into 14 groups based on sugar fermentation and biotype patterns and into more than 20 groups when plasmid and outer-membrane-protein profiles were included. small (mol. wt less than 10 x 10(6)) plasmids were identified in 11 of 34 (32%) h. influenzae isolates, 1 of 2  h. haemolyticus and 4 of 6 (67%) h. parainfluenzae isolates. examination of sugar-fermentation and plasmid patterns increased the ability to distinguish between strains isolated at different times from recurrent disease and may have general applications in the study of haemophilus strains isolated from a single anatomical site.

TI  == fimbriation of haemophilus species isolated from the respiratory tract of adults.
AB  == twenty-two clinical isolates of haemophilus species were studied within two passages of their original isolation for the presence of fimbriae by negative-staining electron microscopy. six isolates were identified as fimbriated, including three strains of nontypable haemophilus influenzae, one strain of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and two strains of haemophilus haemolyticus. in fresh isolates of fimbriated strains of nontypable h. influenzae, approximately 40%-50% of cells had fimbriae; after five passages in vitro, less than 1% of the cells had fimbriae. thus, a variety of haemophilus species that colonize the human respiratory tract can be fimbriated, and this fimbriation is rapidly lost on passage in vitro.

TI  == relative proportions of haemophilus species in the throat of healthy children and adults.
AB  == to determine normal proportions of pharyngeal haemophilus species, qualitative and quantitative mapping of the species in the pharynx of ten healthy children and ten healthy adults was carried out using a selective and a non-selective medium. haemophilus organisms were present in all samples, comprising approximately 10% of the total cultivable flora (range 0.6-36.9%). haemophilus parainfluenzae was a member of the normal flora throughout life, constituting 74% of pharyngeal haemophilus organisms. haemophilus segnis and haemophilus paraphrophilus occurred more frequently in samples from adults, whereas haemophilus haemolyticus was present in only one sample. non-encapsulated haemophilus influenzae strains, usually of multiple biotypes, were present in 80% of the children but accounted for a mean of only 1.8% of the total flora. their number decreased with increasing age; 40% of the adults harbored haemophilus influenzae but only of a single biotype which constituted a minor proportion of the total flora (mean 0.15%). these findings suggest that host mechanisms can influence changes in the proportions of haemophilus influenzae strains colonizing the host.

TI  == aspects of the pathogenicity of some oral and other haemophili.
AB  == the pathogenicity of the predominantly non-capsulated, v-factor requiring haemophili that are commonly recovered from oral infections has been explored by  studies of their endotoxins and infectivity as compared with those of haemophilus influenzae. similar yields of endotoxin (2.40-2.59% w/w) were obtained from all the haemophili examined except h. haemolyticus (1.61% w/w). the lipopolysaccharide (lps) extracts all contained heptoses but not 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (kdo). the fatty acid compositions of the lipid-a fractions were essentially similar but comprised 76% of the lps in the h. influenzae type d strain tested and only 20% in the h. influenzae type b strain and some strains of h. parainfluenzae. all extracts contained arachidic acid, which may be unique to haemophili. the endotoxins from all strains produced characteristic pyrogenic and polymorph effects in rabbits. the endotoxins from the pharyngeal x- and v-factor-requiring strains had ld50 values for actinomycin-d-sensitised mice of 2.4-2.7 micrograms/kg, and were about eight times more potent than those from the oral v-factor-requiring strains (ld50 values 17.2-22.4 micrograms/ml). approximately ten thousand times more free endotoxin was detected in broth cultures of h. influenzae type b than in those of oral haemophili, and this greater endotoxin release was not associated with a greater degree of autolysis. endotoxin release from viable cells may be important in the pathogenicity of this organism. h. influenzae type b was much more potent  in producing infection in chambers implanted subcutaneously in guinea pigs than were oral strains of haemophili; only 10 type b organisms were required, compared with 9 x 10(5) of h. parainfluenzae. however, in infections maintained for 90 days, the numbers of haemophili--c. 10(7)/ml of chamber fluid--were similar for all the test strains. thus, although the oral haemophili lack special attributes  of invasiveness and resistance to host defences, they are not devoid of pathogenic potential and, if allowed to proliferate, may become an important element in an infection.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.

TI  == cross-reactions between haemophilus influenzae and nineteen other bacterial species.
AB  == forty-one different antigens were demonstrated in an antigen preparation obtained by sonication of a haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) type b strain, using crossed immunoelectrophoresis and antiserum obtained from rabbits. antigens were  characterized by absorption experiments with whole heat-killed bacteria, temperature resistance and protein and polysaccharide staining. cross-reactions between h. influenzae type b and 19 other bacterial species were studied by various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods, using the reference system. a non-capsulated h. influenzae cross-reacted extensively (41 antigens) with h. influenzae type b and haemophilus parainfluenzae, and haemophilus haemolyticus showed considerable cross-reactivity with h. influenzae type b (26 and 32 antigens respectively), while antigens from eight other bacterial species cross-reacted to varying degrees with one to five h. influenzae antigens.

TI  == significance of the detection of beta-galactosidase and of beta-xylosidase in the taxonomic study of the genus haemophilus.
AB  == a total of 314 strains of haemophilus, isolated from clinical samples, were studied for the production of beta-galactosidase and beta-xylosidase. none of the h. influenzae strains studied (9 beta-lactamase positive strains and 129 beta-lactamase negative strains) possessed these enzymes. both enzymes were almost constantly observed among strains of h. paraphrophilus (10 strains studied) and of h. paraphrohaemolyticus (9 strains studied). among the other species (h. parainfluenzae, 55 strains; h. haemolyticus, 5 strains; h. parahaemolyticus, 97 strains), beta-galactosidase was present in about 30% of the strains studied whereas beta-xylosidase was detected occasionally (3% of the strains studied). detection of these two enzymes could be a valuable test for the taxonomic study of the genus haemophilus. however, the type of substrate used for the detection of beta-xylosidase is important: use of the para-nitro-phenyl-beta-xylopyranoside yielded more positive results than the use  of its ortho-isomer.

TI  == radiometric detection of haemophilus in simulated blood cultures.
AB  == the radiometric detection of various haemophilus species was studied in simulated blood cultures and in blood culture media without added blood, but supplemented with nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (nad) or hemin, or both. haemophilus aphrophilus was the only species studied that was radiometrically detectable without added blood or nad. all other species studied (haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus haemolyticus, and haemophilus parahaemolyticus) required either added nad, whole blood, or washed blood cells for growth and radiometric detection. the results of this study and extensive experience with clinical specimens show that the radiometric system is an effective means of rapidly detecting haemophilus in blood cultures, but it is essential that it be used in conjunction with a subculture three to five days after inoculation.

TI  == [ampicillin-resistant "haemophilus": their detection and occurrence in brussels area (author's transl)].
AB  == three hundred and five strains of haemophilus (129 h. influenzae, 55 h. parainfluenzae, 97 h. parahaemolyticus, 5 h. haemolyticus, 10 h. paraphrophilus and 9 h. paraphrohaemolyticus) isolated from pathological material over the year  1976, were systematically tested for beta-lactamase production. only 2 strains of h. parainfluenzae produced this enzyme. both were able to transfer ampicillin resistance to escherichia coli k12. all strains but the two beta-lactamase producers were susceptible to penicillin g, ampicillin and cephalotin. however, the correct interpretation of the susceptibility tests needed the microscopic observation of prints of the inhibition zones surrounding the disks: all sensitive strains presented a hazy growth around the disks which corresponded to  the presence of spheroplasts; this phenomenon was not observed with the 2 beta-lactamase producing strains of h. parainfluenzae which grew up to the disks  but presented a typical bacillary form.

TI  == bactericidal factor produced by haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  == when aerobically grown on complex media, haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other haemophilus species and certain genera of the enterobacteriaceae. a total of 341 clinical isolates of haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. ninety-three percent of h. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of h. haemolyticus, 71% of h. parainfluenzae, and 22% of h. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. h. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and h. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. only one strain each of h. aegyptius and h. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of escherichia coli, 85% of salmonella sp., and all citrobacter sp., shigella sp., and yersinia  sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by h. influenzae b. attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. however, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown h. influenzae b by a series of extractions. the ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. the converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed h. influenzae rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of h. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of h. influenzae b.

TI  == bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic haemophilus in the throat.
AB  == hemolytic haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. on rabbit blood-agar they grow well  and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added x and v factors. a survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. from 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in  8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; h. influenzae or h. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; candida and neisseria in 2 sore throats each. all of the 33 hemolytic haemophilus isolates identified to species were h. parahaemolyticus. all were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by gram  stain morphology, but h. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. h. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.
