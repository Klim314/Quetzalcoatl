TI  == in vitro studies of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis in atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.) foregut: tissue responses and evidence of protection against aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida epithelial damage.
AB  == probiotic bacteria increase the host health status and protect mucosal tissue against pathogen-caused damage in mammalian models. using an in vitro (intestinal sac) method this study aimed to address (a) the in vitro ability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis to remain in the gastrointestinal tract of atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.) and (b) its ability to prevent cellular damage caused by  successive incubation with aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida the causative agent of furunculosis. short in vitro incubation of salmon foregut with (tritc)-labelled l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis showed that the probiont was able to colonize the enterocyte surface as studied by confocal microscopy. furthermore, foregut incubated with the probiotic bacteria only, resulted in a healthy intestinal barrier whereas exposure to a. salmonicida disrupted its integrity. however, pre-treatment of salmon intestine with l. delbrueckii subsp.  lactis prevented aeromonas damaging effects. these results are promising in the context of the use of non-autochthonous probiotic bacteria as prophylactic agents against fish bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal tract.
