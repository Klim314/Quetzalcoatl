TI  == cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. t-3811, a free base of t-3811me, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in particular, t-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. t-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). t-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with gyra and parc (grla) mutations. the  activity of t-3811 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. in common with other fluoroquinolones, t-3811 was highly active against haemophilus  influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and legionella sp., with mic90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. t-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. t-3811 was the most active agent against c. trachomatis (mic, 0.008 microgram/ml) and m. pneumoniae (mic90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). the activity of t-3811 against m. tuberculosis (mic90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. in experimental systemic infection with a grla mutant of s. aureus and experimental  pneumonia with prsp in mice, t-3811me showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority  of enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus spp. the mic90 for the members of the enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/l except for serratia spp. (1 mg/l) and in general bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.25 mg/l) than to bay y 3118 (mic90 0.5 mg/l) or sparfloxacin (mic90 1.0 mg/l).  staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to bay y 3118 (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l) and similar differences were noted for staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus epidermidis. streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to bay y 3118 (mic90 0.03 mg/l) as were other streptococci. enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. all strains of  haemophilus influenzae and moraxella spp. were inhibited by bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/l. anaerobes were more susceptible to bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the mic90 of bay y 3118 for bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/l. little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). bay y  3118 inhibited chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/l.

TI  == clarithromycin. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential.
AB  == clarithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered macrolide antimicrobial drug, structurally related to erythromycin. it has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, similar to that of erythromycin and inhibits a range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, atypical pathogens and some anaerobes. significantly, clarithromycin demonstrates greater in vitro activity than erythromycin against certain pathogens including bacteroides melaninogenicus, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycobacterium chelonae subspecies--chelonae and--abscessus, mycobacterium leprae, mycobacterium marinum, mycobacterium avium complex, legionella spp. and, when combined with its 14-hydroxy metabolite, against haemophilus influenzae. however, bacterial strains resistant to erythromycin are also generally resistant to clarithromycin. the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin appears to be enhanced by the formation  in vivo of the microbiologically active 14-hydroxy metabolite. in combination, additive or synergistic activity against a variety of pathogens including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella species (principally legionella pneumophila) and various staphylococci and streptococci has been demonstrated. clarithromycin has a superior pharmacokinetic profile to that of erythromycin, allowing the benefits of twice daily administration with the potential for increased compliance among outpatients where a more frequent regimen for erythromycin might otherwise be indicated. the clinical efficacy of clarithromycin has been confirmed in the treatment of infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts (including those associated with atypical pathogens), skin/soft tissues, and in paediatrics. clarithromycin was as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate drugs including beta-lactams (penicillins and  cephalosporins) in some of the above infections. a most promising indication for  clarithromycin appears to be in the treatment of immunocompromised patients infected with m. avium complex, m. chelonae sp. and toxoplasma sp. small initial  trials in this setting reveal clarithromycin alone or in combination with other antimicrobials to be effective in the eradication or amelioration of these infections. noncomparative studies have provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of clarithromycin in the treatment of infections of the urogenital  tract, oromaxillofacial and ophthalmic areas. however, the promising in vitro and preliminary in vivo activity of clarithromycin against mycobacterium leprae and helicobacter pylori warrant further clinical trials to assess its efficacy in patients with these infections. despite the improved pharmacokinetic profile and  in vitro antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin over erythromycin, comparative  studies of patients with community-acquired infections reveal the 2 drugs to be of equivalent efficacy. however, clarithromycin demonstrates greater tolerability, principally by inducing fewer gastrointestinal disturbances.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  == the microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus aureus (10). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 bacteroides fragilis group and 5 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. these included all 8 tested s aureus and 7 b fragilis group, 3 of 10 h influenzae, 2 of 4 b melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 klebsiella pneumoniae. most cases of s pneumoniae and h influenzae were associated with pneumonia. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. the data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides sp. (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative  and anaerobic bacteria. a recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these  infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == respiratory infections: clinical evaluation.
AB  == a review of clinical studies of piperacillin shows that it is valuable for the treatment of respiratory infections due to enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas sp, anaerobes, and mixed flora including anaerobes. various studies of a total of 420 patients treated with piperacillin for lower respiratory tract infections found that 97% of the patients were cured or markedly improved. piperacillin has also been found as effective as combination therapy (gentamicin or tobramycin plus carbenicillin or ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious infections, including pneumonia and several caused by gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms.  a review of the literature on bacteriological responses to piperacillin shows that 126 of 153 (82%) of the susceptible strains could be eradicated. streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, peptostreptococcus sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp have been completely  eradicated by treatment with piperacillin. most of the published studies indicate that therapy with the drug is usually well tolerated.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic tonsillitis in young adults.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. the predominant anaerobic isolates were  bacteroides sp, fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. the predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). these included all eight isolates of s aureus and five b fragilis, and 11  of 24 b melaninogenicus group (46%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.

TI  == normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml]. in 25%  of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the microorganisms isolated most frequently were: streptococcus, sp. ("viridans group"), veillonella parvula, hemophilus parainfluenzae, lactobacillus, sp., corynebacterium, sp., actinomyces, sp., bacteroides, sp., and hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. the upper range for the  number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == six transtracheal aspirations (tta) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria  and tta aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. differences in bacteria isolated in tta and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. six isolates  were recovered in both sites (three pseudomonas aeruginosa, two staphylococcus aureus and one aspergillus flavus). five aerobic isolates were recovered only in  the expectorated sputum and not in tta aspirations (two klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). nine organisms were isolated only from the tta (two each of veillonella parvula and alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, lactobacillus sp., haemophilus influenzae and gamma hemolytic streptococci). the recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six tta specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. we found tta to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  == adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (group a) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (group b). patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. the adenoids  were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. there were 97 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates in both groups were: bacteroides sp. (including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

TI  == chronic otitis media in children. microbiological studies.
AB  == aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. the middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external  ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. there were 99 aerobic isolates. aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, proteus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae. there were 74 anaerobes isolated. anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic gram-positive cocci, bacteroides sp, and clostridium sp. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial  bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.

TI  == cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. the antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as staphylococcus aureus. other pathogens included streptococcus epidermidis, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as bacteroides fragilis. the drug was well tolerated. pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
