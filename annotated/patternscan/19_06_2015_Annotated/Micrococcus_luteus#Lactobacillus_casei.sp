TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport.
AB  == genetic markers have been in popular use for tracing microbial movement in the environment. however, the impact of genetic marker insertion on microbial surface properties and consequent transport is often ignored. for this research, we investigated the impact of luminescence-based genetic marker insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport. typical gram-positive bacterial strains of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and micrococcus luteus were used as model bacterial strains in this research. we manipulated gene transfer to observe the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties based on contact angle measurements, and we conducted column experiments to evaluate the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial transport. after lux gene insertion, bacterial interactions with the porous media increased, demonstrating stronger deposition potential in the porous media. accordingly, retention of the daughter  strains increased. lux gene insertion also resulted in an increase in bacterial dispersion and equilibrium adsorption in the porous media. the bacterial deposition coefficient was found to correlate with the free energy of interactions between bacteria and the porous media.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == some peculiarities of functioning of h+-atpase from the membranes of the anaerobic bacterium lactobacillus casei.
AB  == radiation inactivation analysis gave the target sizes of 176 +/- 5 kda and 275 +/- 33 kda for atpase from anaerobic lactobacillus casei and aerobic micrococcus  luteus bacteria respectively. the values are close to the known molecular masses  of the enzymes. thus, to function the l. casei atpase, like the f1-atpases, requires a complete structure composed of all the enzyme subunits. l. casei atpase is inhibited by 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole owing to modification of an amino acid residue(s) with pk greater than 8.5. l. casei atpase consists of six identical subunits and differs from alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon-type f1-atpases in a number of catalytic properties. namely, atp hydrolysis under the 'unisite' conditions proceeds at a relatively high rate suggesting the absence of cooperative interactions between the catalytic sites. contrary to mitochondrial f1-atpase. l. casei atpase does not form an inactive complex with adp. these findings imply essential differences in the operating mechanism for l. casei atpase and f1 atpase.
