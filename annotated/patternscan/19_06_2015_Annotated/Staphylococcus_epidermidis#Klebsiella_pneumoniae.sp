TI  == destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification  of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. however, before raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. in this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for raman spectroscopic identification. prior to the isolation, a  liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture pronase e is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. the extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with  6.107 to 6.104 cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus. the compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a classification of single-cell raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (pca) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (lda). these  classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. graphical abstract development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.

TI  == [epidemiology of neonatal purulent meningitis in hebei province, china: a multicenter study].
AB  == objective: to investigate the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and main pathogenic bacteria, and outcomes of neonatal purulent meningitis. methods: a prospective epidemiological study was conducted in neonates with purulent meningitis admitted to 23 cooperating hospitals between 2013 and 2014. clinical data were collected and clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. results: a total of 301 neonates with purulent meningitis from the 23 cooperating hospitals were included. neonatal pneumonia was the most common primary disease (167 cases, 55.5%). fever was the most common manifestation (214 cases, 71.1%). blood culture findings were positive in 72 patients (23.9%), with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. positive cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture was found in 36 patients (36/264, 13.6%) , with escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. the median of csf wbc counts was 80/mm(3) (range: 0-9 2500/mm(3)), and 11 cases (3.7%) had csf wbc counts of <20/mm(3) and 154 cases (51.2%) had csf wbc counts of >100/mm(3). there were 258 patients (85.7%) who were cured or improved at discharge and 15 deaths (15/298, 5.0%). conclusions: the most common primary disease of neonatal purulent meningitis is neonatal pneumonia in this area. the patients with neonatal purulent meningitis most often present with fever. escherichia coli is the leading pathogenic bacteria causing neonatal purulent meningitis. a normal csf wbc count can barely be used to exclude the possibility of this diosorder.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of euphrasia rostkoviana hayne essential oil.
AB  == eyebright, euphrasia rostkoviana hayne (scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. some euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. however, the composition and bioactivity of e. rostkoviana oil are unknown. therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. gc-ms analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool  (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). the essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the best activity was observed against all gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/ml. this is the first report on the chemical composition of e. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == metabolic pathways of pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: chronic airway infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (cf) patients. complex interplays between p. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, burkholderia sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. methods: we generated a library of pa14 transposon insertion mutants to identify  p. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with s. aureus, burkholderia cenocepacia, and k. pneumoniae. results: whereas wild-type pa14 inhibited s. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsc and carb, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. pqsc is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (haqs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carb is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. the carb mutant  was also unable to grow in the presence of b. cepacia and k. pneumoniae but not escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. we further identified a transposon insertion in purf, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. this mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of gram-negative but not of gram-positive bacteria. we identified a beneficial interaction in a bioa transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. this growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of k. pneumoniae or e. coli. conclusion: complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing cf-lungs. this work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between p. aeruginosa and  three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.

TI  == challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the theraflex mb-plasma technology.
AB  == background and objectives: although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. this study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (mb) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. materials and methods: bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the theraflex mb-plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, mb/light treatment and mb filtration. virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. results: leucocyte  filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than  4 logs (staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of  detection (lod) (>/= 4.8 logs; escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae). mb/light and mb filtration further reduced staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to below the lod. the small bacterium brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the lod by additional mb/light treatment and mb filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by theraflex mb-plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. conclusion: theraflex mb-plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.

TI  == validation of sterility testing of cord blood: challenges and results.
AB  == background: sterility testing for cord blood (cb) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. here, the automated bact/alert (biomerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in cb units processed at the canadian national public cord blood bank. study design and methods: a three-phase validation was developed. cb units  were prepared with pentastarch (phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (phase 3). in phase 1, cb was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans. plasma (8 ml) and buffy  coat (bc; 0.5 and 8 ml) were inoculated into culture bottles. in phases 2 and 3,  a mix of red blood cells (rbcs) and plasma (4 ml each) was used as the inoculant. in phase 3, aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product rbcs and plasma were determined. the bc fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. results: in phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in cb units containing antibiotics. thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. c. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of rbcs and plasma, all organisms were detected. the use  of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. c. albicans and a. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in rbcs and bc. cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during cb processing. conclusions: a mix of plasma and rbcs is appropriate for cb sterility testing. interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. the clinical significance of the  bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in cb merits further investigation.

TI  == functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis)  and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5  against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections,  particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == the in vitro antibacterial effect of s53p4 bioactive glass and gentamicin impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads.
AB  == osteomyelitis is a disease that is still difficult to treat, with considerable morbidity and associated costs. the current "gold standard" in treatment - debridement and implantation of antibiotic impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) beads - presents the disadvantage of a second surgical intervention required for the removal of the beads. we comparatively investigated the in vitro antibacterial effect of s53p4 bioactive glass (bag) and gentamicin impregnated pmma beads. bacterial viability was assessed hourly by standard plate count during 24 hours of incubation, by determining the number of colony forming units  (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae. both tested materials showed an antibacterial effect on all studied bacteria. in case of s. aureus, bag granules were almost as effective as gentamicin impregnated pmma beads, with no statistically significant differences. in contrast, pmma beads had a superior antibacterial effect on s. epidermidis and k. pneumoniae. the antibacterial effect of bag was greatly influenced by granule size and contact time. there was a statistically significant correlation between ph values and the number of cfu in the case of s53p4 bag granules. as a biocompatible and biodegradable bone substitute, s53p4 bioactive glass can be a good alternative in the local management of osteomyelitis.

TI  == anti-biofilm activity: a function of klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide.
AB  == competition and cooperation phenomena occur within highly interactive biofilm communities and several non-biocides molecules produced by microorganisms have been described as impairing biofilm formation. in this study, we investigated the anti-biofilm capacities of an ubiquitous and biofilm producing bacterium, klebsiella pneumoniae. cell-free supernatant from k. pneumoniae planktonic cultures showed anti-biofilm effects on most gram positive bacteria tested but also encompassed some gram negative bacilli. the anti-biofilm non-bactericidal activity was further investigated on staphylococcus epidermidis, by determining the biofilm biomass, microscopic observations and agglutination measurement through a magnetic bead-mediated agglutination test. cell-free extracts from k. pneumoniae biofilm (supernatant and acellular matrix) also showed an influence, although to a lesser extend. chemical analyses indicated that the active molecule was a high molecular weight polysaccharide composed of five monosaccharides: galactose, glucose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid and glucosamine and the main following sugar linkage residues [--> 2)-alpha-l-rhap-(1 -->]; [--> 4)-alpha-l-rhap-(1 -->]; [alpha-d-galp-(1 -->]; [--> 2,3)-alpha-d-galp-(1 -->]; [--> 3)-beta-d-galp-(1 -->] and, [--> 4)-beta-d-glcap-(1 -->]. characterization of this molecule indicated that this component was more likely capsular polysaccharide (cps) and precoating of abiotic surfaces with cps extracts from different serotypes impaired the bacteria-surface interactions. thus the cps of klebsiella would exhibit a pleiotropic activity during biofilm formation, both stimulating the initial adhesion and maturation steps as previously described, but also repelling potential competitors.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  == objective: abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time  of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. we sought to determine an effective antibiotic in pmma beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. methods: pmma beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. results: daptomycin alone  was not active against k. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant s. aureus. tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. the addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. the presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. conclusions: antibiotic pmma beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. the addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.

TI  == rapid detection of contaminant bacteria in platelet concentrate using differential impedance.
AB  == background and objectives: current fda-approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrate (pc) can yield false-negative results attributed to poisson-limited sampling errors incurred near the time of collection that result in undetectable bacterial concentrations. testing pc at the point of issue (poi) extends the incubation period for any contaminant bacteria increasing the probability of detection. data are presented from time-course experiments designed to simulate poi testing of bacterially contaminated pcs at different stages of growth using differential impedance sensing. study design and methods: whole-blood-derived pcs were typically spiked  with low numbers of bacteria (approximately 100 cfu/ml) and incubated under standard pc storage conditions. each infected unit was evaluated every two hours  over a 12-h period. all samples were treated with a chemical compound that induces stress in the bacterial cells only. the development of any bacterial stress was monitored by detecting changes in the dielectric properties of the pc  using differential impedance. results: differential impedance measurements and corresponding cell counts at the different time-points are presented for six organisms implicated in post-transfusion-septic reactions. all infected pcs were  detected once contaminant bacteria reached concentrations ranging between 0.6 x 10(3) and 6 x 10(3) cfu/ml irrespective of the phase of growth. results were obtained within 30 min after the start of the assay and without the need for cell lysis or centrifugation. conclusion: differential impedance sensing can detect bacterial contamination in pc rapidly at concentrations below clinical thresholds known to cause adverse effects.

TI  == next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  == loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at  room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection  and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life,  shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  == background: the source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (git) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (vlbw, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. we hypothesize the built environment (be), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature vlbw infants. here, we present the first matched fecal-be time series analysis of two preterm vlbw neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) over the first month of life. results: fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an illumina hiseq2000 device. for each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each nicu room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (emirge) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16s rrna amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. over 24,000 full-length 16s rrna sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (otus) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. dominant gut taxa, including staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. reconstructed genomes  from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and  sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the nicu environment. conclusions: we have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16s rrna gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. the approach enabled identification of discrete icu reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.

TI  == antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of dispersinb(r)-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  == the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and  acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant  enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.

TI  == comparison of biofilm and attachment mechanisms of a phytopathological and clinical isolate of klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae.
AB  == some bacterial species can colonize humans and plants. it is almost impossible to prevent the contact of clinically pathogenic bacteria with food crops, and if they can persist there, they can reenter the human food chain and cause disease.  on the leaf surface, microorganisms are exposed to a number of stress factors. it is unclear how they survive in such different environments. by increasing adhesion to diverse substrates, minimizing environmental differences, and providing protection against defence mechanisms, biofilms could provide part of the answer. klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae is clinically important and also associated with fruit diseases, such as "pineapple fruit collapse." we aimed to characterize biofilm formation and adhesion mechanisms of this species isolated from pineapple in comparison with a clinical isolate. no differences were found between the two isolates quantitatively or qualitatively. both tested  positive for capsule formation and were hydrophobic, but neither produced adherence fibres, which might account for their relatively weak adhesion compared to the positive control staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 35984. both produced biofilms on glass and polystyrene, more consistently at 40 degrees c than 35 degrees c, confirmed by atomic force and high-vacuum scanning electron microscopy. biofilm formation was maintained in an acidic environment, which may  be relevant phytopathologically.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and elution kinetics of linezolid from polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  == polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) impregnated with antibiotics is widely used in the  treatment of osteomyelitis and infected arthroplasties. with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, linezolid, which is active against gram-positive bacteria and toward which resistance has been scarce, has been suggested as an alternative. in the current in vitro study, the authors sought to determine and compare the efficacy and elution kinetics of linezolid from pmma. polymethylmethacrylate beads impregnated with linezolid, vancomycin, or gentamicin alone and in combinations were placed in suspensions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the leaching out concentrations of antibiotics and growth inhibitory time in days were recorded. the mechanical strength of cement beads was evaluated in accordance with international standard 5833. the growth inhibitory time of linezolid was significantly longer than that of vancomycin and gentamicin for methicillin-resistant s aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and s epidermidis. the combination of linezolid with gentamicin and vancomycin significantly increased the growth inhibitory time compared with either antibiotic used alone. linezolid alone or in combination with vancomycin and gentamicin showed satisfactory elution kinetics and antimicrobial activity in vitro without compromising the mechanical strength of pmma. future research evaluating the in vivo profile of linezolid-loaded pmma in experimental animals is needed before it can be considered for human use.

AB  == background: transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates (pcs) can result in serious health consequences for the affected patient. before being  released from blood banking facilities, pcs are routinely screened for bacterial  contamination by culture-based tests. however, culture-based pc screening methods require extended holding and incubation periods and are prone to false-negative results due to sampling error. screening pcs closer to the time of transfusion using rapid point-of-issue tests represents an alternative approach; however, fda-approved assays generally suffer from a lack of sensitivity. study design and methods: presented herein is the feasibility of a novel approach toward rapid, sensitive, and universal detection of bacterially contaminated pcs via selective  measurement of microbial dna polymerase activity. this approach is achieved using a differential cell lysis procedure in combination with enzymatic template generation and amplification (termed etga-pc assay). results: serial dilution spiking experiments revealed an approximate sensitivity of 30 to 200 colony-forming units (cfus)/ml (mean, 85 cfus/ml) for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. an additional 22 clinically relevant strains of bacteria were also detected below 200 cfus/ml after spiking into pc aliquots. furthermore, the etga-pc assay was able to accurately monitor the presence and growth of seven clinically relevant bacterial species that were spiked into pc units. conclusion: together, the data presented  here demonstrate that the etga-pc assay is a feasible approach for rapid and sensitive detection of bacterially contaminated pcs. experiments, aimed at simplification and/or automation of the assay procedure, are under way.

TI  == emergence of enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in south korea.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in south korea. methods: medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 january 2004 and 31 july 31 2010  were reviewed. four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. outcome measures were culture-proven  infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in  the patients. results: a total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. the positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). the most common organisms identified were enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %,  6/96), and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). two cases of enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. the  most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were e. faecalis and  k. pneumoniae. conclusions: the emergence of e. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of e. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. this increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  == background: non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been  explored in this setting. aims: this study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. method: glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes  on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rdna sequencing. methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, epsilon tests and pcr. gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. results: total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. environmental bacteria, particularly bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. enterococcus faecalis , klebsiella pneumoniae , pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. conclusion: health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.

TI  == antibacterial properties of cyclodextrin-antiseptics-complexes determined by microplate laser nephelometry and atp bioluminescence assay.
AB  == cyclodextrins (cds) are able to form inclusion complexes with other molecules, thereby, protecting these guest molecules from degradation, enhancing their biocompatibility or influencing their physiological distribution while retaining  their activity. here, antibacterial effects of cd-complexes with the antiseptics  chlorhexidine diacetate (chx), iodine (iod) and polihexanide (phmb) were determined using two different in vitro methods, microplate laser nephelometry and an atp bioluminescence assay. laser nephelometry is a direct method for monitoring and evaluating growth of micro-organisms by measurement of the turbidity of the solution. in contrast, the atp bioluminescence assay determines  specifically the amount of metabolic active bacterial cells. the antibacterial effects of cd-antiseptics-complexes were examined for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and the results of both methods were compared in respect of calculated means of half maximal inhibitory concentrations (ic50) and  statistical evaluated pearson's correlation coefficients (r). it could be demonstrated that both methods showed a high comparability although they differ in the parameters tested. this study revealed that cd-complexes with chx and phmb were most effective against e. coli and the tested staphylococci. while cd-iod-complexes obtained high activity against k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa was  distinctly more resistant compared to the other bacteria.

TI  == infections secondary to pacemaker implantation: a synopsis of six cases.
AB  == introduction: permanent cardiac pacing is a technique whose indications have increased in the last 20 years. as with any foreign body, pacemaker implantation  is associated with the risk of infection. the objective of this study was to describe the clinical, paraclinical and treatment options of infections secondary to pacemaker implantation at the cardiology department of the aristide le dantec  teaching hospital (chu aristide le dantec) in dakar, senegal. methods: we conducted a retrospective study over a period of three years (from january 2005 to december 2007) during which pacemaker implantation was carried out in 107 patients. all patients with local and/or systemic signs of infection were included in our study. results: the prevalence of infection in patients with pacemakers was 5.6% in our series and infection occurred in three women and three men, with a mean age of 66.2 years (range 23-83). the delay time for the onset of clinical signs of infection was 6.6 months, with a range of eight days to 12 months. the clinical signs were externalisation of the pacemaker with suppuration (five cases), fever (one case) and inflammatory signs (one case). factors favouring the occurrence of infection were co-morbidity (four cases), pre-operative length of stay (average eight days), use of temporary cardiac pacing (three cases), the number of people in the theatre (average 4.5), postoperative haematoma (one case) and repeating the surgical procedure (three cases). staphylococcus epidermidis (two cases), staphylococcus aureus (two cases) and klebsiella pneumonia (one case) were the organisms isolated at the local site. transthoracic echocardiography showed no objective signs of endocarditis. the treatment was antibiotic therapy for an average duration of 50.4 days after debridement of the infected site (six cases). we noted four recurrences at six months and one death from sepsis at 12 months. conclusion: infections secondary to pacemaker implantation are rare but serious. their management is difficult and requires the removal of the implanted material, hence the importance of prevention of infection, or the removal and re-implantation of the pacemaker at another site in cases of infection. this is particularly important in our region  where pacemakers are very expensive.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of dextran-capped silver nanoparticles with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  == dextran-capped silver nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing silver nitrate with nabh4 in the presence of dextran as capping agent. the characters of silver  nanoparticles were investigated using uv-vis spectrophotometer, nano-grainsize analyzer, x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. results showed that the silver nanoparticles capped with dextran were in uniform shape and narrow size distribution. moreover, compared with polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp)-capped silver nanoparticles, the dextran-capped ones possessed better stability. antibacterial tests of these silver nanoparticles were carried out for escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. results suggested that the dextran-capped  silver nanoparticles had high antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in addition, the cytotoxicity in vitro of the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles was investigated using mouse fibrosarcoma cells (l929). the toxicity was evaluated by the changes of cell morphology and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. results indicated that these silver nanoparticles had slight effect on the survival and proliferation of l-929 cells at their minimal inhibitory concentration (mic). after modified by dextran, the physiochemical properties of the silver nanoparticles had been improved. we anticipated that these dextran-capped silver  nanoparticles could be integrated into systems for biological and pharmaceutical  applications.

TI  == a broad-range method to detect genomic dna of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  == it remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. this work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16s rdna region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (gnrs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (lspr) property. in the quantitative detection of artificial sequence,  the limit of detection (lod) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pm level. this pair of universal gnrs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (pcs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing serratia marcescens-spiked pcs. therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective dna analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in pcs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.

TI  == synthesis of short cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics containing arginine analogues.
AB  == worldwide efforts are underway to develop new antimicrobial agents against bacterial resistance. to identify new compounds with a good antimicrobial profile, we designed and synthesized two series of small cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics (1-8) containing unusual arginine mimetics (to introduce cationic charges) and several aromatic amino acids (bulky moieties to improve lipophilicity). both series were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against a representative panel of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial strains, and candida albicans. the biological screening showed that peptidomimetics containing tryptophan residues are endowed with the best antimicrobial activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis in respect to the other synthesized derivatives (mic values range 7.5-50 microg/ml). moreover,  small antimicrobial peptidomimetics derivatives 2 and 5 showed an appreciable activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria and c. albicans. the most active compounds (1-2 and 5-6) have been tested against gram-positive established biofilm, too. results showed that the biofilm inhibitory concentration values of  these compounds were never up to 200 microg/ml. the replacement of tryptophan with phenylalanine or tyrosine resulted in considerable loss of the antibacterial action (compounds 3-4 and 7-8) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. furthermore, by evaluating hemolytic activity, the synthesized compounds did not reveal cytotoxic activities, except for compound 5.

TI  == rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  == flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. in this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (prp)-derived platelet concentrates (pcs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. five bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were used. platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) cfus per ml; 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 2.0 ml aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. during the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. we could detect a low concentration (10 cfus per ml) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 ml) of pcs. irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of s. aureus and s. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of b. cereus, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli were 16 hours or less. a higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. the numbers of detected bacteria  increased during the incubation. however, the graphs corresponding to k. pneumoniae and e. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. the incubation of small volumes of pc with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using prp-derived pcs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet (plt)-poor plasma, plt-rich plasma, plt gel, and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. the nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. study design and methods: plt-poor plasma (ppp), plt-rich plasma (prp), plt gel (pg), and solvent/detergent-treated plt lysate (s/d-pl) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/ml with four  gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31  degrees c. bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. results: there was no viable escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and plt materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively)  3 hours after spiking to prp, ppp, or s/d-pl from the first donor but less (1.1,  4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in pg, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. similar data were obtained with the second donor. no plasma and plt material had antimicrobial activity against enterobacter cloacae, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. conclusion: plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and plt biomaterials against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. activation of the coagulation to prepare pg may reduce antimicrobial activity. these findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. the purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. the most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp., streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pneumoniae. maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. the most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp. and streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). the insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. in case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.

TI  == role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. methods: we performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of nac. we also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with nac or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and fitc-labeled concanavalin a. we measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa), s. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and c. krusei. results: nac 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9%  reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of nac ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in nac-treated biofilms for all organisms except vre. the number of non-viable cells in nac-treated gram-positive biofilms  was increased (p<0.05 for mrsa and vre). nac-treated gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. conclusions: nac is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. nac has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  == cell-free extracts prepared from kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, candida albicans,  and k. kingae. the extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the k. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides.  one was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-glcnacp-(1-->5)-beta-d-oclap-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. the second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated pam galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-galf-(1-->. purified pam galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. a cluster of three k. kingae genes encoding udp-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of pam galactan in escherichia coli. pam galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. the biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

AB  == the major l-amino acid oxidase (laao, ec 1.4.3.2) of king cobra (ophiophagus hannah) venom is known to be an unusual form of snake venom laao as it possesses  unique structural features and unusual thermal stability. the antibacterial effects of king cobra venom laao were tested against several strains of clinical  isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. for comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. king cobra venom laao was very effective in inhibiting the two gram-positive bacteria (s. aureus and s. epidermidis) tested,  with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.78mug/ml (0.006mum) and 1.56mug/ml (0.012mum) against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, respectively. the mics are comparable to the mics of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. however, the laao was only moderately effective against three gram-negative bacteria tested (p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. coli), with mic ranges from  25 to 50mug/ml (0.2-0.4mum). catalase at the concentration of 1mg/ml abolished the antibacterial effect of laao, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. binding studies indicated that king cobra venom laao binds strongly to the gram-positive s. aureus and s. epidermidis, but less strongly to the gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy by liposome-encapsulated water-soluble photosensitizers.
AB  == photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is an alternative method for killing bacterial cells in view of the increasing problem of multi-antibiotic resistance. we examined the effect of three water-soluble photosensitizers (phs): methylene blue (mb), neutral red (nr) and rose bengal (rb) on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we compared the efficacy of phs in their free form and encapsulated in liposomal formulations against various bacterial strains, and determined conditions for the effective use of encapsulated phs. we found that all three phs were able to eradicate the gram-positive microbes staphylococcus aureus and sarcina lutea; and mb and rb were effective against st. epidermidis. in the case of the gram-negative species, mb and rb were cytotoxic against the shigella flexneri, nr-inactivated escherichia coli and salmonella para b, and br  was effective in killing pseudomonas aeruginosa. none of the examined phs showed  activity against klebsiella pneumoniae. mb and nr enclosed in liposomes gave a stronger antimicrobial effect than free phs for all tested prokaryotes, whereas encapsulation of rb led to no increase in its activity. we suggest that encapsulation of phs can increase the photoinactivation of bacteria.

TI  == pathogen incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in children.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in children with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) in order to optimize empirical antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis. from 2001 to 2006, 895 children with an indwelling catheter from 3 hospitals in china  were included in this study, of whom 335 (37.4%) had cauti. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 450 bacterial isolates was performed using the clsi broth and kirby-bauer agar dilution methods. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus spp. e. coli had higher susceptibility to ceftazidime (87.4%), cefuroxime (85.1%) and cefatrizine (76.6%) than to sulfamethoxazole (smz) (8.0%), amoxicillin (21.7%), ampicillin (17.1%) and cefazolin (37.7%). isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus species had similar patterns as e. coli. s. aureus had lower susceptibility to smz (6.8%), ampicillin (8.2%), and amoxicillin (24.7%); the trend of s. epidermidis was similar. this study demonstrates that the gram-negative species are the predominating uropathogens of cauti in children. it is important to know the bacterial spectrum and the susceptibility patterns to various classes of antibiotic agents to improve empiric antibiotic therapy of children with cauti in china.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  == background: a single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. there is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (plts), and red blood cells. study design and methods: in this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (amps) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored plt concentrates (pcs). nine synthetic amps, four from plt microbicidal protein-derived peptides (pd1-4) and five arg-trp (rw) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and pc samples spiked with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus cereus. a 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. results: in both plasma alone and pcs,  rw3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae; pd4 and rw2 against p. aeruginosa; and rw4 against k. pneumoniae. the activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. conclusions: these findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic amps against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, pcs, and other blood products.

TI  == in vitro assessment of the antibiotic efficacy of contrast media and antibiotics  and their combinations at various dilutions.
AB  == discography is a controversial diagnostic procedure involving the injection of radiographic contrast medium (rcm) into the intervertebral disc. iatrogenic bacterial discitis is a rare but serious complication. the intervention has been  increasingly performed in our patients here in the united arab emirates. prophylactic intravenous antibiotic administration can reduce post-interventional discitis; however, this may favour the development of bacterial resistance. direct intradiscal injection of an antibiotic together with the rcm is a potential alternative. to date, there has been only one study on the efficacy of  antibiotics added to an rcm. equally, there are only limited data regarding the potential direct effect of rcm on bacterial growth. the purpose of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of antibiotics is affected when rcm are added.  in an in vitro study, the effect of non-ionic rcm on the growth of five laboratory bacterial strains, alone and in combination with three broad-spectrum  antimicrobials, was tested. bacterial growth was assessed in the absence and the  presence of rcm, antibiotics and their combinations. all three rcm alone demonstrated some inhibition of bacterial growth at high concentrations. in the presence of the rcm, all three antibiotics retained their inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. in conclusion, our in vitro experiments did not reveal any changes in the antimicrobial efficacy of the three antibiotics in the presence of the three tested rcm. subsequent clinical trials will need to assess whether intradiscal antibiotic administration may be a suitable substitute for, or a supplement to, prophylactic systemic antibiotics before discography.

TI  == identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood cultures: comparison between conventional and pcr methods.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, and klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in a survey in a medical center. a pcr method for identification of these five most common pathogens in blood cultures was developed. a unique sequence was chosen for each pathogen and used for primer design. sixty-one blood samples (from hospitalized patients) in which bacterial growth was detected were processed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods and by the pcr method. the results obtained by pcr were identical to those obtained by conventional methods in 93.4% of the cases. pcr failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 6.6% of the cases (mostly bacteria not included in the pcr cassette). another group of eighty-eight blood samples from patients were processed immediately upon their arrival at the  laboratory by taking aliquots for the pcr method. the blood sample bottles were processed in parallel by conventional methods. in 78.4% of the cases the results  of both methods were identical. in 12.5% of the cases, pcr afforded identification of bacteria but conventional methods showed no bacteria in the sample. on the other hand, pcr afforded 9.1% negative results while conventional  methods identified bacteria not included in the pcr cassette. it is concluded that the molecular method appears to be a specific and precise method for identifying pathogenic bacteria in blood samples.

TI  == bacteria, biofilm and honey: a study of the effects of honey on 'planktonic' and  biofilm-embedded chronic wound bacteria.
AB  == chronically infected wounds are a costly source of suffering. an important factor in the failure of a sore to heal is the presence of multiple species of bacteria, living cooperatively in highly organized biofilms. the biofilm protects the bacteria from antibiotic therapy and the patient's immune response. honey has been used as a wound treatment for millennia. the components responsible for its  antibacterial properties are now being elucidated. the study aimed to determine the effects of different concentrations of 'medihoney' therapeutic honey and norwegian forest honey 1) on the real-time growth of typical chronic wound bacteria; 2) on biofilm formation; and 3) on the same bacteria already embedded in biofilm. reference strains of mrse, mrsa, esbl klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with dilution series of the honeys in microtitre plates for 20 h. growth of the bacteria was assessed by measuring optical density every 10 min. growth curves, biofilm formation and minimum bactericidal concentrations are presented. both honeys were bactericidal against  all the strains of bacteria. biofilm was penetrated by biocidal substances in honey. reintroduction of honey as a conventional wound treatment may help improve individual wound care, prevent invasive infections, eliminate colonization, interrupt outbreaks and thereby preserve current antibiotic stocks.

TI  == flexible microfluidic device for mechanical property characterization of soft viscoelastic solids such as bacterial biofilms.
AB  == we introduce a flexible microfluidic device to characterize the mechanical properties of soft viscoelastic solids such as bacterial biofilms. in the device, stress is imposed on a test specimen by the application of a fixed pressure to a  thin, flexible poly(dimethyl siloxane) (pdms) membrane that is in contact with the specimen. the stress is applied by pressurizing a microfabricated air channel located above the test area. the strain resulting from the applied stress is quantified by measuring the membrane deflection with a confocal laser scanning microscope. the deflection is governed by the viscoelastic properties of the pdms membrane and of the test specimen. the relative contributions of the membrane and test material to the measured deformation are quantified by comparing a finite element analysis with an independent (control) measurement of the pdms membrane mechanical properties. the flexible microfluidic rheometer was used to characterize both the steady-state elastic modulus and the transient strain recoil of two soft materials: gellan gums and bacterial biofilms. the measured linear elastic moduli and viscoelastic relaxation times of gellan gum solutions were in good agreement with the results of conventional mechanical rheometry. the linear young's moduli of biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae, which could not be measured using conventional methods, were found to be 3.2 and 1.1 kpa, respectively, and the relaxation time of the s. epidermidis biofilm was 13.8 s. additionally, strain hardening was observed in all the biofilms studied. finally, design parameters and detection limits of the method show that the device is capable of characterizing soft viscoelastic solids with elastic moduli in the range of 102-105 pa. the flexible microfluidic rheometer addresses the need for mechanical property characterization of soft viscoelastic  solids common in fields such as biomaterials, food, and consumer products. it requires only 200 pl of the test specimen.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (ec) enhances the activities of  aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus gordonii. this phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. the purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against p. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and s. epidermidis. an eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or ec to biofilm-coated coupons were used. no significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) cfu/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for s. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. we  detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes ec were used against mrsa biofilms (p = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes ec against s. epidermidis biofilms (p = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). the results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of  the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by ec is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aac6'-aph2'' enzyme.
AB  == vertilmicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside with a structure similar to that of netilmicin except for a methyl group at the c-6' position. in the present study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin was studied, and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aminoglycoside bifunctional modifying enzyme aac(6')-aph(2'') was compared with those of verdamicin and netilmicin. a total of 1,185 clinical isolates collected from hospitals in beijing between 2000 and 2001 were subjected to the in vitro antibacterial activity evaluations, including mic, minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), and time-kill curve tests. the mics were evaluated in non-gentamicin-resistant (gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-intermediate) strains and gentamicin-resistant strains, respectively. for most of the non-gentamicin-resistant bacteria (except for the isolates of pseudomonas spp.),  the mic(90)s of vertilmicin were in the range of 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, comparable to those of the reference aminoglycosides. for the gentamicin-resistant isolates, the three semisynthetic aminoglycosides (vertilmicin, netilmicin, and amikacin) demonstrated low mic(50)s and/or mic(90)s, as well as high percent susceptibility values. among the study drugs, vertilmicin showed the lowest mic(90)s, 16 microg/ml, for the gram-positive gentamicin-resistant isolates of staphylococcus  aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. meanwhile, vertilmicin was a potent bactericidal agent, with mbc/mic ratios in the range of 1 to 2 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and s. aureus and 1 to 4 for s. epidermidis. the time-kill curve determination further demonstrated that this effect was rapid and concentration dependent. in evaluations of susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aac(6')-aph(2'') with maximum rate of metabolism/k(m) measurements, vertilmicin exhibited susceptibilities to both acetylation and phosphorylation lower than those of netilmicin and verdamicin.

TI  == anti-biofilm properties of chitosan-coated surfaces.
AB  == surfaces coated with the naturally-occurring polysaccharide chitosan (partially deacetylated poly n-acetyl glucosamine) resisted biofilm formation by bacteria and yeast. reductions in biofilm viable cell numbers ranging from 95% to 99.9997% were demonstrated for staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans on chitosan-coated surfaces over a 54-h experiment in comparison to controls. for instance, chitosan-coated surfaces reduced s. epidermidis surface-associated growth more than 5.5 (10)log units (99.9997%) compared to a control surface. as a comparison, coatings containing a combination of the antibiotics minocycline and  rifampin reduced s. epidermidis growth by 3.9 (10)log units (99.99%) and coatings containing the antiseptic chlorhexidine did not significantly reduce s. epidermidis surface associated growth as compared to controls. the chitosan effects were confirmed with microscopy. using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy  and fluorescent-dye-loaded s. epidermidis, the permeabilization of these cells was observed as they alighted on chitosan-coated surfaces. this suggests chitosan disrupts cell membranes as microbes settle on the surface. chitosan offers a flexible, biocompatible platform for designing coatings to protect surfaces from  infection.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == risk factors for central venous catheter-related infections in pediatric intensive care.
AB  == objectives: to identify risk factors for short-term percutaneously inserted central venous catheter-related infections in children and to evaluate the accuracy of a mortality score in predicting the risk of infection. method: after  reviewing the charts of patients who developed catheter-related infection in a university hospital's pediatric intensive care unit, we conducted a case-controlled study with 51 pairs. variables related to patients and to catheter insertion and use were analyzed. risk factors were defined by logistic regression analysis. the accuracy of the pediatric risk of mortality score to discriminate the risk for infection was tested using the receiver operating characteristic curve. results: infection was associated with respiratory failure, patient's length of stay, duration of tracheal intubation, insertion of catheter  in the intensive care unit and parenteral nutrition. insertion site (femoral or internal jugular) was unimportant. multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following variables. risk factors included more than one catheter  placement (p=0.014) and duration of catheter use (p=0.0013), and protective factors included concomitant antibiotic use (p=0.0005) and an intermittent infusion regimen followed by heparin filling compared to continuous infusion without heparin (p=0.0002). pediatric risk of mortality did not discriminate the  risk of infection. conclusions: central parenteral nutrition and central venous catheters should be withdrawn as soon as possible. femoral vein catheterization carries a risk of infection similar to internal jugular catheterization. the pediatric risk of mortality score should not be used to predict the risk of central catheter-related infections.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride on bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  == aim: to study the effect of antiseptics on bacterial biofilm formation. methods and results: biofilm formation and planktonic growth were tested in microtiter plates in the presence of antiseptics. for escherichia coli g1473 in the presence of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, for klebsiella pneumoniae cf504 in the presence of chlorhexidine and for pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 in the presence of  benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of antiseptics. for pao1 in the presence of chlorhexidine and cf504 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, planktonic growth was significantly inhibited by a fourfold lower antiseptic concentration than biofilm development. for staphylococcus epidermidis cip53124 in the presence of antiseptics at the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), a total inhibition of  biofilm formation was observed. for staph. epidermidis exposed to chlorhexidine at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 mic, or to benzalkonium chloride at 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 mic, biofilm formation was increased from 11.4% to 22.5% without any significant effect onto planktonic growth. conclusions: chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride inhibited biofilm formation of different bacterial species but were able to induce biofilm development for the staph. epidermidis cip53124 strain at sub-mics. significance and impact of the study: sublethal exposure to cationic antiseptics may contribute to the persistence of staphylococci through biofilm induction.

TI  == sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  == objective: we investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. materials and methods: semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. in all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in  order to assess motility as a function of time. enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. besides these bacterial strains, candida albicans was also used. results and conclusions: observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism  concentration. however, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was  prominent. regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be  confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. no or  poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with e. aerogenes at the second hour. the data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial inactivation in prestorage pooled, leukoreduced, whole blood-derived platelet concentrates suspended in plasma prepared with photochemical treatment.
AB  == background: photochemical treatment (pct) with amotosalen and ultraviolet light was developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet (plt) components suspended in 35 percent plasma and 65 percent additive solution (as). because plt additive solutions (ass) are not used in the united states, this study evaluated the ability of the pct process to inactivate low levels of bacteria in pooled whole blood-derived plts (rdp) suspended in 100 percent plasma. study design and methods: four replicate experiments were performed with two gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, and two gram-negative organisms, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. for each experiment, 6 abo-identical rdp units were pooled, leukoreduced before or after pooling, inoculated to approximately 1 to 10 colony-forming units per ml with plasma-resistant bacteria, and treated with the pct process. residual viable bacterial levels were measured before and after each step and 4 and 6 days after  inoculation. for each bacterium studied, a fifth rdp pool was prepared and contaminated, but not treated. these units served as controls for bacterial growth. results: growth of s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and k. pneumoniae was eliminated in all four treated pools while growth continued in the control pools. there was no growth of e. coli in the treated pools and the control pool. conclusion: these pilot experiments demonstrate inactivation of bacteria in plts  suspended in plasma, suggesting that the pct process may address contamination in conventional rdps. additional experiments with a wider range of bacteria and evaluation of plt function in 100 percent plasma will be needed before implementation.

AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their zn(ii) and pd(ii) complexes.
AB  == thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and s-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  zn(ii) and pd(ii) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. mic values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida albicans. the thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. picolinaldehyde-s-methyl- and -s-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their zn(ii) complexes showed selective  activity. the antimicrobial activity is relatively high in me2so, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with me2so, hconme2, etoh and chcl3.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. the  antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. the honey  samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution.  most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of s. aureus even at 50% dilution. undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of staphylococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. no inhibition of micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. the diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. this observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.

TI  == antibacterial activity of positive and negative polarity low-voltage pulsed current (lvpc) on six typical gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of chronic wounds.
AB  == the positive effect of electrical stimulation (es) on wound healing has been shown in vitro and in vivo. on the basis of increased blood flow, protein denaturation, and stimulation of cellular defense, an antibacterial effect of es  is to be expected. although the antibacterial effect of es already has been demonstrated in vitro, little attention has been paid to the direct antibacterial effect of changing polarity of the applied current. the aim of this study was to  investigate the antibacterial effect of positive and negative monophasic low-voltage pulsed current on typical gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens of chronic wounds. using the dermapulse-system, three gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and three gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia faecium) organisms were tested against positive and negative polarity low voltage pulsed current. all tested organisms were significantly reduced by es. the reduction differed significantly between positive polarity and control and negative polarity and control, with the highest log10 reduction factor (rf) achieved with  positive polarity. using positive polarity, the maximum rf was measured for e. coli (median log10 rf 0.83; 25th percentile 0.59, 75th percentile 0.98) and the lowest for s. epidermidis (median log10 rf 0.20; 25th percentile 0.17, 75th percentile 0.24). yet, there was no significant difference with positive es against gram-positive or gram-negative organisms.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and edta combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (ot), protamine sulfate (ps) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. methods and results: the in vitro activity of ot, ps and edta alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. all the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. however, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory  effect on biofilm formation by k. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis.  furthermore, 79-95% reduction in ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. conclusion: the subinhibitory concentrations of ot, ps and edta in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (gras) compounds such as ot, ps and edta may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates prepared from spiked single donations using cultural and molecular genetic methods.
AB  == bacteria show differences in their growth kinetics depending on the type of blood component. on to storage at 22 degrees c, platelet concentrates (pcs) seem to be  more prone to bacterial multiplication than red cell concentrates. knowledge of the potential for bacterial proliferation in blood components, which are stored at a range of temperatures, is essential before considering implementation of a detection strategy. the efficacy of bacterial detection was determined, using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), following bacterial growth in blood components obtained from a deliberately contaminated whole-blood (wb) unit. cultivation was used as the reference method. wb was spiked with 2 colony-forming units ml(-1)staphylococcus epidermidis or klebsiella pneumoniae, kept for 15 h at room temperature and component preparation was processed. samples were drawn, at intervals throughout the whole separation process, from each blood component. nucleic acids were extracted using an automated high-volume extraction method. the 15-h storage revealed an insignificant increase in bacterial titre. no bacterial growth was detected in red blood cell or plasma units. k. pneumoniae showed rapid growth in the pooled pc and could be detected immediately after preparation using rt-pcr. s. epidermidis grew slowly and was detected 24 h after separation. these experiments show that sampling is indicative at 24 h after preparation of pcs at the earliest to minimize the sampling error.

TI  == bismuth-norfloxacin complex: synthesis, physicochemical and antimicrobial evaluation.
AB  == norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent which is active against various gram-positive as well as gram-negative microorganisms. presence of metal  ions considerably alters the activity of fluoroquinolones against potentially susceptible bacteria. as bismuth is known to possess a good antibacterial activity, bismuth complex of norfloxacin was prepared by reacting bismuth citrate with aqueous solution of norfloxacin. the structure of the bismuth-norfloxacin complex (bnc) was confirmed by spectral, chemical and elemental analysis. antimicrobial studies were carried out using agar diffusion method against escherichia coli (atcc 25922), klebsiella pneumoniae (ntcc 10320), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), bacillus pumilis (ntcc 8241) and staphylococcus epidermidis  (atcc 12228). the results showed significant increase (p<0.05, tukeys test) in antibacterial activity of bnc as compared with norfloxacin and physical mixture of norfloxacin and bismuth citrate. this increase in activity is being considered due to increased bioavailability of the metal drug complex. thus, the use of the  bnc may be preferable over norfloxacin alone.

TI  == construction of a leftover bath water model for microbial testing.
AB  == in this study, in order to construct a model of leftover bath water, we analyzed  one hundred samples of used bath water samples which were provided by twenty-eight volunteer families. it appeared that the number of detected bacteria from such bath water was correlated closely with the number of bathers. moreover, the ph, acidity, chemical oxygen demand (cod), ion, protein content of the leftover bath water were measured. the number of bathers had no connection with the ph, acidity, cod, and ion content of the leftover bath water. however, the protein content of the bath water correlated with the number of detected bacteria. based on these results, the model of leftover bath water was constructed. achromobacter xylosoxidans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with the model bath water as indices of bath water contamination. the number of incubated viable cells in the model bath water increased with increasing concentrations of casamino acid. consequently, it was suggested that varying the concentration of casamino acid based on family size or contamination  would be necessary in the efficient use of the constructed model of leftover bath water for microbial testing.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

AB  == a series of 61 indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against bacillus cereus var mycoides, bacillus pumilus, bacillus  subtilis, bordetella bronchiseptica, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and saccharomyces cerevisiae. twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at  least one of the test organisms used in the screening. on the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of dorema ammoniacum, sphaeranthus indicus, dracaena cinnabari, mallotus philippinensis, jatropha gossypifolia, aristolochia indica, lantana camara, nardostachys jatamansi, randia dumetorum and cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. this probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of glmu enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  == the colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. we have developed an antibiofilm  composition comprising an n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (glmu) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. the antibiofilm activity of glmu inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (ida), n-ethyl maleimide (nem), and nem analogs, including n-phenyl maleimide, n,n'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (opdm), and n-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (pyrm), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. both ida and nem inhibited biofilm formation in escherichia coli. all nem analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. the combination of opdm with protamine sulfate (ps) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microm. in addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters against p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a glmu inhibitor and protamine  sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of some medicinal plants from cameroon.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of 10 plant species (voacanga africana, crepis cameroonica, plagiostyles africana, crotalaria retusa, mammea africana, lophira lanceolata, ochna afzelii, ouratea elongata, ou. flava and ou. sulcata), each of  which is currently used in the traditional medicine of cameroon, were investigated in vitro. the activities of a methanol extract of each plant were tested, in disc-diffusion assays, against 37 reference or laboratory strains of seven species of microorganism (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus hirae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans). the minimal inhibitory concentrations of each extract were then estimated, against each of the more susceptible microorganisms  (i.e. those giving an inhibition zone measuring at least 9 mm in diameter in the  disc-diffusion assays), by agar dilution. although, in the disc-diffusion assays, each of the 10 methanol extracts investigated displayed some degree of antimicrobial activity against at least one species of microorganism, no activity against the gram-negative bacteria (es. coli, k. pneumoniae and ps. aeruginosa) was observed. the extract with the greatest antimicrobial activity was that of pl. africana (euphorbiaceae).

TI  == ethanol disinfection of plastic-adherent micro-organisms.
AB  == this study investigated the bactericidal effect of ethanol/water (70:30 vol:vol)  against plastic-adherent organisms that commonly cause line infections. the experiments were performed in polycarbonate wells and all incubations were at 37  degrees c. bacteria in broth were inoculated into wells and incubated (16, 40 and 72 h) before washing to remove non-adherent organisms and exposure to ethanol/water. wells were then re-incubated with broth to detect surviving bacteria. all organisms incubated for 16 h were killed by 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol. after incubation for 40 h, 4h of exposure to ethanol was required to kill two strains of candida albicans. likewise, one of three of both klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, incubated for 72 h, showed growth after 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol but not after 4h of exposure. these results suggest that in contrast to log phase organisms, which are killed by ethanol/water solutions in seconds, plastic-adherent organisms are more resistant to the bactericidal activity of ethanol.

TI  == antimicrobial titanium/silver pvd coatings on titanium.
AB  == background: biofilm formation and deep infection of endoprostheses is a recurrent complication in implant surgery. post-operative infections may be overcome by adjusting antimicrobial properties of the implant surface prior to implantation.  in this work we described the development of an antimicrobial titanium/silver hard coating via the physical vapor deposition (pvd) process. methods: coatings with a thickness of approximately 2 mum were deposited on titanium surfaces by simultaneous vaporisation of both metals in an inert argon atmosphere with a silver content of approximately 0.7-9% as indicated by energy dispersive x-ray analysis. on these surfaces microorganisms and eukaryotic culture cells were grown. results: the coatings released sufficient silver ions (0.5-2.3 ppb) when immersed in pbs and showed significant antimicrobial potency against staphylococcus epidermis and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. at the same time, no  cytotoxic effects of the coatings on osteoblast and epithelial cells were found.  conclusion: due to similar mechanical performance when compared to pure titanium, the tiag coatings should be suitable to provide antimicrobial activity on load-bearing implant surfaces.

TI  == sterility testing of platelet concentrates prepared from deliberately infected blood donations.
AB  == background: in general the bacterial count in freshly donated blood is low and even lower in the corresponding platelet concentrates (pcs). by use of flow cytometry (facs) for sterility testing, the reliability of early versus later sampling times was evaluated. study design and methods: blood donations were spiked with various numbers of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the corresponding pcs were prepared by the buffy-coat method and stored at 22 degrees c. a 20-ml sample was collected from each pc directly after preparation and after 8 hours. samples were stored at 35 degrees c. sterility testing of both pcs and samples was by facs analysis at different time points. results: all stored pcs were found positive by facs analysis, with detection times ranging between 8 and 24 hours (k. pneumoniae, b.  cereus), 8 and 91 hours (s. aureus), and 144 hours (s. epidermidis). in the samples incubated at 35 degrees c, bacteria were detected after 8 to 19 hours (k. pneumoniae, b. cereus), 8 to 67 hours (s. aureus), and 19 to 43 hours (s. epidermidis). some of the samples did not contain bacteria. conclusion: detection times for slow-growing bacteria are significantly shortened when pc samples are incubated at 35 degrees c: the numbers of bacteria in freshly prepared pcs may, however, be so low that the samples drawn for sterility testing do not contain a  single bacterium. our results do not support a shortening of the 24-hour or greater sampling time recommended by the manufacturers of established test systems, because also for consistent detection by facs, bacteria need to grow in  the pcs to sufficient numbers.

TI  == erythromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  == in order to establish the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the  synergistic or antagonistic behavior of erythromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. metal complexes of erythromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with erythromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. various microorganisms used were staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, shigella dysentery, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis. for mic observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. our investigations reveal that formation of erythromycin complexes result in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of erythromycin increases with respect to parent erythromycin drug and mic of drug metal complexes decreased.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == a study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: the optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. multiple site cultures may  improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. we hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a  single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. objective: to determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in  the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. design/methods: clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis.  a minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. results: a total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. in all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. in all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. all neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. the other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. the single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (3), combined mrsa and candida albicans (2), candida albicans alone (2), late-onset group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gbs) (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), enterococcus fecalis (1), escherichia coli (1), and serratia marcescens (1). since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. conclusions: two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood  volume of>or=1 ml.

AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis treated successfully with polymyxin b.
AB  == peritonitis is not an infrequent complication of inpatients with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd). capd peritonitis may be related to the catheter or secondary to perforation of an intra-abdominal viscus. the most common organisms usually associated with capd peritonitis are staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative staphylococci). rarely, aerobic gram-negative bacilli have been the causative agents of capd peritonitis. the treatment of capd peritonitis usually requires removal of the peritoneal catheter and treatment with parenteral antibiotics active against the causative pathogen. we report a case of capd-associated peritonitis caused by an extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. the case presented had this strain of multidrug-resistant k. pneumoniae present in blood cultures and the peritoneal fluid. extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, for example, k. pneumoniae, are multidrug-resistant and sensitive to few antibiotics. this isolate was intermediately sensitive to amikacin and meropenem, but the patient did not clinically improve on these 2 antibiotics. polymyxin b therapy was initiated after lack of clinical improvement after dialysis catheter removal and 1 week of meropenem and amikacin therapy. the patient responded rapidly to therapy with polymyxin b. polymyxin b has a unique mechanism of action on bacterial cells and is highly active against all multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms except proteus species and serratia marcescens. no toxicity was observed during therapy. polymyxin b is being used increasingly as a therapeutic alternative to multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  == the reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. new derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such  as, o-glycidylketoxime (4) and o-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted n-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. the syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. all of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis atcc 14153 and candida albicans atcc 10231. among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-o-[2-hydroxy-3-(n-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against s. aureus atcc 6538. the compounds 2, 5b, 6b,  6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-o-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against c. albicans atcc 10231. none of the other compounds  exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.

TI  == bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == tetrasodium edta as a novel central venous catheter lock solution against biofilm.
AB  == background: central venous catheter (cvc)-related bloodstream infections (bsis) are known to increase rates of morbidity and mortality in both inpatients and outpatients, including hematology-oncology patients and those undergoing hemodialysis or home infusion therapy. biofilm-associated organisms on the lumens of these catheters have reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial chemotherapy. this study tested the efficacy of tetrasodium edta as a catheter lock solution on biofilms of several clinically relevant microorganisms. methods: biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and candida albicans were grown to levels of approximately 1 x 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/cm(-1) on cvc segments in a model system, then subjected to the tetrasodium edta lock treatment. results: comparisons of biofilms before and after exposure to the 40-mg/ml(-1) tetrasodium edta lock for 21 hours showed that the biofilm viable cell counts of all organisms tested were significantly reduced (p < .05) after exposure to the treatment. conclusion: antimicrobial lock treatment using 40 mg/ml(-1) of tetrasodium edta for at least 21 hours could significantly reduce or potentially eradicate cvc-associated biofilms of clinically relevant microorganisms.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == [nosocomial bacteremia: epidemiology and current antimicrobial drugs resistances].
AB  == nosocomial bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. a change is being observed in the distribution of its causative agents, as well as an increase in the resistances to some antimicrobial drugs. we have analyzed 600 significant bacteremia episodes during the year 2002, studying the resistances to antimicrobial drugs and some epidemiological aspects. bacteremias caused by gram-positive were 57%, while the ones caused by gram-negative were 46.1%. the three microorganisms more frequently isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. in s. aureus low resistance to oxacillin (10.3%) was observed. streptococcus pneumoniae with lower sensitivity to penicillin was observed in 49.9%. resistance of gram-positive microorganisms to vancomycin/teicoplanin was not observed. e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae showed low prevalence of expanded spectrum ss-lactamase strains. there are differences in epidemiology of bacteremias at regional level, and continuous local programs for monitoring resistances to antimicrobial drugs are needed.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == protozoan grazing and its impact upon population dynamics in biofilm communities.
AB  == aims: to determine the impact of protozoan grazing on the population dynamics of  a multispecies bacterial biofilm community. methods and results: grazing by acanthamoeba castellanii and the ciliate colpoda maupasi upon biofilm and planktonic communities, composed of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas fluorescens and staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. biofilms were formed using glass coverslips, held in a carousel device, as substrata for biofilm formation or in glass flow cells. the predatory effects of the amoeba were generally confined to the biofilm, where grazing rates corresponded to losses from the biofilm equivalent to ca 30,000 biofilm cells cm(-2) h(-1), with the amoeba becoming an integral part of the community. c. maupasi reduced the thickness of mature multispecies biofilms at steady-state from 500 to <200 microm. conclusions: we report that the presence of the protozoa a. castellanii and c. maupasi markedly influence population dynamics within defined biofilm communities. significance and impact of the study: the current study dispels the  popular opinion that biofilms are protected against predation by protozoa. a. castellanii clearly has the capacity to graze mixed biofilm communities and to become integrally associated with them, whereas the ciliate c. maupasi reduced biofilm thickness by up to 60%.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == decontamination of surfaces by lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles.
AB  == cells and enzymes can be used to decontaminate soil, water supplies, personal equipment, weapons and hospital equipment that have been exposed to bacteria, toxins or viruses. one of the problems associated with the use of microorganisms  and enzymes for decontamination purposes is that the presence of water is not acceptable for some applications such as electronic equipment. one way of circumventing this problem is to allow the enzyme to distribute between a water phase and an organic phase-containing surfactant and then use the encapsulated enzyme in reverse micelles directly into the device to be clean. reverse micelles were used to deliver the enzyme (lysozyme) to the cell-surface interface. they serve as a way to increase the local concentration of lysozyme and decrease the amount of water delivered. specifically, we explored the lysis by free lysozyme and lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles of klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis attached to steel, glass, and hydroxyapatite. these two bacteria have been selected because they are known to be pathogenic and because of their differences in cell wall structure. lysozyme was added to the surfaces in either reverse micelles or as a free solution and was tested under conditions of stirring and no stirring. stirring was implemented to study the interplay between mass transfer limitations and surface roughness. we have shown  that free lysozyme or lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles is capable of decontaminating surfaces of different texture. lysis of the cells is slower when  the encapsulated enzyme is used but lysis is more complete.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mic90 of mepm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. mepm showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa. mepm was active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse). 2. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae. carbapenems including mepm were active against these esbl strains. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == kidney transplants from infected donors: our experience.
AB  == organ procurement from infected donors may transmit a disease to the recipient that could cause a graft loss and/or recipient morbidity. retrospectively, all kidney transplants from infected donors at our center in the last 4 years were reviewed. a donor was considered infected in the presence of at least one positive culture before procurement. from january 1999 to 2003, 23 of 160 donors  (14.5%) were infected: in 10 donors a positive blood culture; in 3, a urine culture; and in 13, a bronchial culture. in a further 12 (7%) donors, only the preservation solution was contaminated. organisms isolated were: staphylococcus coagulase.neg. (n = 7); staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3); staphylococcus aureus (n = 6); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4); acinetobacter (n = 1); candida albicans (n = 13); aspergillus (n = 1); and escherichia coli (n = 1). all except 2 kidneys were transplanted with positivity  in all cultures. all recipients received general, nonspecific, antibacterial and  antifungal prophylaxis until the antibiotic and antifungal spectrum was ready. patient and graft survival rates at 6 months were 94% and 93%, respectively. two  deaths occurred due to bacterial arteritis (p aeruginosa), and 2 acute graft losses due to fungal arteritis. kidneys from infected donors seem suitable for transplants. only grafts infected by vasculotropic agents (s aureus, p aeruginosa, and c albicans) should be discarded.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  == standard microbiological tests (i.e., mic) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (pd)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (pft) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. the methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. thirty-six clinical isolates, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. in the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial pd-related peritonitis. titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. titers were  highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. overall, pfts were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.0001). the addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.0001). in the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (p = 0.036). in conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the pft as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of pd-related peritonitis. with further characterization and validation in patients, the pft test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for pd-related peritonitis.

TI  == [increasing trend of antimicrobial drug-resistance in organisms causing bacteremia at a tertiary-care hospital: 1995 to 2000].
AB  == we described the trends of drug-resistant organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a teaching hospital from 1995 to 2000. we found an increase in the number of clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp, serratia spp, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and enterococcus spp, resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat infections  caused by these organisms. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones increased during the period of study, and in 2000 more than 20% of the isolates were resistant. in contrast, the frequency of resistance to aminoglycosides and carbapenems was less than 20%. the frequency of resistant staphylococci increased exuberantly fifty fold to quinolones and five fold to oxacillin during the study period, therefore in 2000, 26.1% of s. aureus isolates and 61% of s. epidermidis were resistant to oxacillin. the frequency of resistant enterococci also increased, and in 2000, 50% were resistant to ampicillin, and 37.5% to gentamicin. the increase of drug resistant organisms isolated in blood had a direct impact in the empirical treatment of severely infected patients in our hospital. it is important to continuously supervise antibiotic use, and to adopt more strict control measures  to decrease the frequency of infections caused by drug resistant organisms.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

TI  == risk factors for the development of bacterial infections in multiple myeloma treated with two different vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone schedules.
AB  == background and objectives: we evaluated bacterial infections (bis) in patients with multiple myeloma (mm) treated with two different schedules of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (vad). design and methods: ninety-seven patients were studied during 340 vad cycles. vad was given by either continuous intravenous infusion (cii) to hospitalized patients or rapid intravenous infusion (rii) to outpatients. the characteristics of patients and vad schedules were retrospectively analyzed to detect correlations with the incidence of bi. results: by analyzing each vad cycle, we found that profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.06) and post-treatment neutropenia (p=0.08) were associated with a trend for a higher risk of infection, while renal function impairment was significantly correlated with bi risk at both univariate (p<0.02)  and multivariate (p<0.002) analyses. evaluating only the first 4 months of therapy, characterized by a significantly higher incidence of bi than the later period (p<0.0001), previously untreated disease was significantly correlated with bi risk (p<0.04), while male sex (p=0.06), cii schedule (p=0.07), and profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.1) were associated with a tendency to a higher risk of infection; however, at multivariate analysis the latter two parameters independently predicted bi probability (p<0.015 and p<0.03, respectively) as did  previously untreated disease (p<0.025). the high probability of cii-related infection was demonstrated to depend on the frequent development of nosocomial infections. interpretation and conclusions: patients with profound hypogammaglobulinemia who receive vad as first line treatment are at a major risk of bi up to the completion of the fourth month of therapy. in this setting hospitalization should be avoided and, if patients require admission, antibacterial prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulins could be appropriate and effective.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  == an agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of  antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. the catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. the catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. the efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (cs)  catheters, cs catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (cs+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (mr) catheters and silver catheters against staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis rif-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. no significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. in both models, cs+ and mr catheters were effective against s. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas cs catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. cs+ catheters were  effective against s. epidermidis rif-r2, whereas mr catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. cs+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans in the agar model, whereas mr catheters were effective only against s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains. silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. the agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

AB  == objective: the national nosocomial infections surveillance (nnis) system personnel report trends in antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. to validate select  antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and to identify test methods that tend to produce errors, we conducted proficiency testing among nnis system hospital laboratories. setting: nnis system hospital laboratories in the united states. methods: each laboratory received five organisms (ie, an imipenem-resistant serratia marcescens, an oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, a vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus epidermidis, and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbetal)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae). testing results were compared with reference testing results from the centers for disease control and prevention. results: of 138 laboratories testing imipenem against the serratia marcescens strain, 110 (80%) correctly reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) or  zone sizes in the resistant range. all 193 participating laboratories correctly reported the staphylococcus aureus strain as oxacillin resistant of the 193 laboratories, 169 (88%) reported correct mics or zone sizes for the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. one hundred sixty-two (84%) of 193 laboratories demonstrated the ability to detect a vancomycin-intermediate strain  of staphylococcus epidermidis, however, disk diffusion performed poorly when testing both staphylococci and enterococci with vancomycin. although laboratory personnel correctly reported nonsusceptible extended-spectrum cephalosporins and  aztreonam results for k. pneumoniae, only 98 (51%) of 193 correctly reported this organism as an esbetal producer. conclusion: overall, nnis system hospital laboratory personnel detected most emerging resistance patterns. disk diffusion continues to be unreliable for vancomycin testing of staphylococci and must be used cautiously for enterococci. further education on the processing of esbetal-producing organisms is warranted.

TI  == prevalence and drug susceptibility of pathogens causing bloodstream infections in northern italy: a two-year study in 16 hospitals.
AB  == the epidemiology of bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infection was studied in 16 hospitals in lombardy (northern italy) over a 2-year period (1999 and 2000). overall, 2924 microorganisms causing significant bacteremia were collected. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli ( n=663; 22.7%), staphylococcus aureus ( n=534; 18.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis ( n=242; 8.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=176; 6.0%). unlike escherichia coli, which was usually acquired from the community, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were usually acquired in hospitals. rates of resistance to oxacillin and its associated traits were significantly higher among hospital-acquired staphylococci as compared to those of isolates from the community. escherichia coli was highly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with a very low percentage of strains producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). on the contrary, production of esbl appeared to be an important mechanism of resistance among nosocomial isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae. resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread in several members of the  family enterobacteriaceae, with rates often exceeding 10%. moreover, with regard  to ciprofloxacin, there were no significant differences between rates of resistance among enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-acquired infections versus those causing community-acquired infections. multidrug resistance was commonly observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the need for new antimicrobial agents that are more active against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. in conclusion, epidemiological studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of blood isolates in northern italy appear to provide useful information for both empirical treatment of suspected infections and better management of patients.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients: practical problems and rational solutions.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection in children, and is  often fatal. risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness.  viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia; infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with gram-negative organisms. an increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult; diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiological findings, and microbiological results. recommended empiric therapy should consider factors such as the time of onset of illness, severity of disease, and specific risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, including use of mechanical ventilation, underlying disease, or recent use of antibacterials. the  resident local hospital flora should be considered when selecting therapy for nosocomial pneumonia. early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. for empiric treatment of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia, an intravenous antibacterial regimen that includes coverage of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive organisms should be used. a carbapenem or ureidopenicillin derivative (piperacillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor should be used where extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae are endemic. therapy should be modified when a specific pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility are identified. effective prevention of nosocomial pneumonia requires infection control measures that affect the environment, personnel, and patients. of these, hand hygiene, appropriate infection control policies, and judicious use of antibacterials are essential.

TI  == low frequency of bacteraemia during eye surgery obviates the need for endocarditis prophylaxis.
AB  == purpose: to determine the incidence of bacteraemia following eye surgery, and thereby evaluate the need for antibiotic cover during such procedures, in patients who are at risk for bacterial endocarditis. methods: this prospective study involved 50 consecutive patients undergoing extraocular surgery at the sultan qaboos university hospital, muscat, oman. local preparation of the surgical site in all patients included pre-operative instillation of 0.3% gentamicin and 3% povidone-iodine eye drops. two eye swabs (one from the conjunctival sac and another from the eyelid margin) and two venous blood samples (one taken just before the procedure and the second 10 min into it) were collected and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. surgery-related bacteraemia was defined as a negative pre-operative blood culture followed by a positive intraoperative blood culture of the same bacterium identified in the positive eye swab. results: only two patients (4%) demonstrated surgery-related bacteraemia: one caused by staphylococcus epidermidis (following entropion correction) and the other by haemophilus influenzae (following dacryocystorhinostomy). four other patients had positive conjunctival swabs without bacteraemia, the causative organisms being haemophilus influenzae in two, and staphyloccus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae in one each. conclusion: ophthalmic surgery is not associated with significant bacteraemia, and therefore  does not mandate routine antibiotic cover in patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis. stringent pre-operative preparation of the surgical site may suffice to minimise bacteraemia; however, this requires further study.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == method for studying development of colonization and infection of dialysis catheters.
AB  == microbial colonization and infection of dialysis catheters is the major cause of  catheter failure. the present study aimed to develop a method to permit the study of microbial biofilm formation and antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy. standard silicon rubber and silver-impregnated catheters were sectioned into 1 mm slices and placed into 1-cm x 2-cm culture slide chambers. fresh clinical isolates were  obtained from infected patients and suspended in concentrations of 10(3), 10(6),  and 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) per milliliter in a variety of liquid suspending culture media, which included serum protein constituents. antibiotics  could be added to the suspending fluid to determine prophylactic activity, or at  any time thereafter to determine therapeutic activity. the catheter sections were incubated with the microbial challenge for 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours and then washed in flowing distilled water to remove unattached biofilm. they were then stained with acridine orange, which fluoresces microbial dna, and  were examined by confocal scanning laser microscopy. biofilm formation, representing colonization and infection, were quantified by comparing the fluorescent pixel analysis of the uninoculated control with the challenged catheter. the method was reproducible and permitted quantitative analysis. standard silicon rubber catheters demonstrated greater biofilm formation than silver-impregnated catheters. the method examines the factors involved in microbial colonization and infection, and in antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == increase of enterobacter in neonatal sepsis: a twenty-two-year study.
AB  == background: data on the incidence of enterobacter infections in neonates over prolonged periods of time are scant. we determined the epidemiology of enterobacter sepsis and/or meningitis and the trends of infection in a neonatal unit. methods: retrospective review of sepsis and/or meningitis in inborn neonates admitted to son dureta university hospital during a 22-year period. molecular study by ribotyping of the enterobacter strains isolated from 1995 to 1997. results: there were 513 cases of culture-proved sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates. in late onset infections klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequent isolates in the period 1977 through 1991. enterobacter was the most common isolate in the period 1992 through 1998. during  this latter period candida infections also increased, and the resistance rate of  enterobacter to cefotaxime was higher (59.2%). decrease in early onset infections and increase in late onsets (4.6/1,000 live births) were observed in the second period. from 1977 to 1998, 45 episodes of sepsis and/or meningitis by enterobacter species were identified in 44 patients (8.7% of all neonatal bacteremias). three patients with enterobacter bacteremia died (6.6%, 0.03/1,000  live births). during 1995 through 1997 5 different clones causing sepsis were identified and 3 were predominant. in 1997 there was an outbreak of enterobacter  disease. after cleaning, cohort nursing and hygiene reinforcement, enterobacter was not isolated in the next 2 years. no change in the antibiotic policy was made. conclusions: we observed a resurgence of enterobacter infections in our neonatal intensive care unit. the sudden disappearance of this microorganism after reinforcement of hygienic measures, without withdrawing cefotaxime, confirms the importance of patient-to-patient transmission of this nosocomial infection. further studies are needed to establish the role of antibiotics in the emergence of microorganisms in neonatal intensive care units.

TI  == mechanisms of biofilm resistance to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == biofilms are communities of microorganisms attached to a surface. it has become clear that biofilm-grown cells express properties distinct from planktonic cells, one of which is an increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. recent work has  indicated that slow growth and/or induction of an rpos-mediated stress response could contribute to biocide resistance. the physical and/or chemical structure of exopolysaccharides or other aspects of biofilm architecture could also confer resistance by exclusion of biocides from the bacterial community. finally, biofilm-grown bacteria might develop a biofilm-specific biocide-resistant phenotype. owing to the heterogeneous nature of the biofilm, it is likely that there are multiple resistance mechanisms at work within a single community. recent research has begun to shed light on how and why surface-attached microbial communities develop resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  == background: recent reports from europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. to assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. study design and methods: quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) cfu/ml) by day of storage. results: all examples of b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per ml by day 3 after inoculation. by day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) cfu per ml. units contaminated with s. epidermidis showed slower and more varied  growth. by day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) cfu per ml. by day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per  ml. conclusion: these experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) cfu per ml on day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. it would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.

AB  == patients with antibody deficiency disorders are highly susceptible to bacterial infections. replacement therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (ivig) has been established in such patients for two decades. the efficacy of ivig treatment depends on the amount of functional pathogen-specific antibodies provided. the present study was undertaken to determine the levels of immunoglobulin classes, igg subclasses, and specific antibodies to bacterial surface antigens in two different ivig preparations (sandoglobulin and gamimmune) and blood sera of ivig-treated immunodeficient patients. the levels of igg, iga,  igm and igg subclasses were determined in both ivig preparations and in patients' sera and were compared with those of healthy individuals. sandoglobulin contained significantly higher concentrations of iga, igg, and igg4 than gamimmune. the latter contained higher concentrations of igg1. patients treated with gamimmune)  had significantly lower concentration of igg4 as compared with healthy individuals and sandoglobulin-treated patients. this finding was related to the preparation's composition. screening of 20 lots from each preparation for antibodies to frequent clinically isolated strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococci spp. showed a high lot-to-lot variability. in order to overcome the lot-to-lot variability and correlate the observed effects with each ivig preparation, the administered ivig lots were selected so that their titers were in the interval of mean value +/- s.d. for each pathogen. the two tested preparations showed significant differences in their content of specific antibodies that ultimately affected the levels of these antibodies in treated patients. more specifically, sandoglobulin contained higher levels of antibodies to e. coli and s. epidermidis strains. infusion of this preparation maintained the respective antibodies in the recipients significantly higher than those of healthy individuals. gamimmune infusion led to similar and comparable levels. both ivig preparations had comparable antibody titers towards k. pneumoniae, provided high amounts of antibodies, and kept recipients' specific igg at levels significantly higher than those of the healthy individuals. enterococci spp. specific antibodies were significantly higher in gamimmune, whereas titers of antibodies towards s. aureus were comparable. levels of antibodies against both enterococci spp. and s. epidermidis after administration of both preparations were close to those in healthy individuals. none of the patients developed infection during the time of  the study. in conclusion, most of the lots of the two ivig preparations studied,  despite some quantitative differences, provide patients with sufficient amounts of antibodies to bacterial surface antigens that protect them against infections.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of staphylococcus epidermidis in a neonatal intensive care unit over a three-year period.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially staphylococcus epidermidis, are increasingly important nosocomial pathogens, particularly in critically ill neonates. a 3-year prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) was performed by traditional epidemiologic methods as well as molecular typing of microorganisms. the aims of the study were (i) to quantify the impact of s. epidermidis on nicu-acquired infections, (ii) to establish if these infections are caused by endemic clones or by incidentally occurring bacterial strains of this ubiquitous species, (iii) to evaluate the use of different methods for the epidemiologic typing of the isolates, and (iv) to characterize the occurrence and the spread of staphylococci with decreased glycopeptide susceptibility. results confirmed that s. epidermidis is one of the  leading causes of nicu-acquired infections and that the reduced glycopeptide susceptibility, if investigated by appropriate detection methods such as population analysis, is more common than is currently realized. typing of isolates, which can be performed effectively through molecular techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis but not through antibiograms, showed that many of these infections are due to clonal dissemination and, thus, are potentially preventable by strict adherence to recommended infection control practices and the implementation of programs aimed toward the reduction of the unnecessary use  of antibiotics. these strategies are also likely to have a significant impact on  the frequency of the reduced susceptibility of staphylococci to glycopeptides, since this phenomenon appears to be determined either by more resistant clones transmitted from patient to patient or, to a lesser extent, by strains that become more resistant as a result of antibiotic pressure.

TI  == the effects of chlorhexidine irrigation solution on contaminated bone-tendon allografts.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine an expedient and effective method for  disinfecting contaminated human bone-tendon allografts. the first part of this study used beef muscle and cadaveric human tissues to determine the most effective solution and volume to decontaminate tissues inoculated with four different organisms: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. of the solutions tested (benzalkonium chloride, castile soap, castile soap followed by benzalkonium chloride, triple antibiotic, chlorhexidine gluconate, and chlorhexidine gluconate/triple antibiotic), only the 4% chlorhexidine power irrigation solution and 4% chlorhexidine/triple antibiotic bath completely disinfected all tissues. work in part 2 revealed that a 2% chlorhexidine irrigation solution was equally effective as the 4% solutions. part 3 of the study involved human achilles tendon-calcaneus allografts. we found similar results: 3 liters of 2% chlorhexidine power irrigation solution thoroughly removed all microorganisms from the contaminated tissues. all control allografts irrigated with normal saline solution alone revealed positive bacterial growth for all four organisms after 72 hours' growth on sheep blood agar. total decontamination time was 10 to  12 minutes. two percent chlorhexidine irrigation solution may be an effective method for decontaminating human bone-tendon allografts challenged with a polymicrobial inoculum. this method of disinfecting bone-tendon allografts is at  least five times more expeditious than methods in previously reported studies.

(p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

AB  == objective: to elucidate the epitope structure to dna by identifying antigenic determinants on bacterial dna bound by anti-dna antibodies from normal human subjects (nhs) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). methods: sera from nhs and patients with sle were tested by elisa for the presence of antibodies to single stranded dna from calf thymus, micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium perfringens, and klebsiella pneumoniae. to assess binding to conserved and nonconserved determinants, sera were absorbed  on dna-cellulose affinity columns bearing each of the bacterial dna and then tested for binding to the other dna antigens. results: absorption of sle sera with any of the bacterial dna caused a loss of binding to all other bacterial dna as well as calf thymus dna. in contrast, absorption of nhs sera with bacterial dna caused a loss of binding to the dna on the affinity column with much less effect on binding to the other dna antigens. conclusion: these results indicate a marked difference in the specificity of antibodies to bacterial dna in nhs and patients with sle. the binding of sle anti-dna to predominantly conserved determinants suggests that a shift in patterns of anti-dna specificity may be associated with the autoimmune state.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

(2 per cent each). the bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. the study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. it highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

AB  == objectives: nosocomial infections result in considerable morbidity and mortality  in neonatal intensive care units (nicus). the aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the molecular epidemiology approach in the surveillance and control of infections in the nicu. methods: a 1-year prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections in a nicu was performed using traditional epidemiological methods as well as molecular typing of micro-organisms. results:  the nosocomial infection rate among the 343 newborns was 24.8%. the risk of infection was associated with low birth weight, prolonged length of stay, empiric antibiotic treatment and nasopharyngeal colonization. four pathogens (klebsiella  pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were responsible for more than 80% of the infections. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (esbl) k. pneumoniae and mrsa infections constituted outbreaks caused by a single clone, whereas mrse and  mssa infections did not represent outbreaks but rather a series of sporadic infections caused by different strains. conclusions: molecular epidemiology techniques are powerful tools that can elucidate modes of spread and reservoirs of infection in the nicu and identify effective measures to control epidemic or endemic situations.

AB  == the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.

TI  == is the limulus amebocyte lysate the sole predictor of septic episodes in major thermal injuries?
AB  == septic episodes in thermal injuries are usually hallmarked by a series of physiologic parameters that include tachypnea, prolonged paralytic ileus, hyperthermia or hypothermia, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis or unexplained leukopenia, acidosis, and hyperglycemia. recent studies with polycystic kidney disease have clearly indicated that the limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assays were predictive of fungal infections in this patient population. because both bacteria and fungi produce lipopolysaccharide that can be identified with the lal assay, we randomly assayed sequential sera of 45 patients with major thermal injuries for positivity in the lal assay, with use of the qcl-1000 kit (biowhittaker, walkersville, md). the average burn size of this patient population was 63.43% total body surface area. the average age of the patient was 6.2 years. the sex distribution included 30 males and 15 females. the infectious agents included gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, and 14 patients had concomitant fungal infections. eighty-five percent of the patients tested were positive for endotoxin, with levels ranging from < 0.1 eu/ml to > 1.0 eu/ml. the predominant organism isolated before or on the date the serum was drawn was pseudomonas aeruginosa (51%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (15%).  the remaining 34% were a variety of enterobacteriaceae. of the 14 patients who yielded a fungus, 3 had negative lal assays. two patients with an elevated lal grew only staphylococcus epidermidis in the bloodstream and the wounds. these data clearly indicate that the lal assay cannot be relied on as the sole predictor of septic episodes; however, it can be an adjunctive test to confirm sepsis when the other parameters have been considered.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  == a total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to staphylococcus aureus (200), staphylococcus epidermidis (200), streptococcus pneumoniae (20), escherchia coli (200), klebsiella spp. (177), serratia marcescens (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), haemophilus influenzae (35) and salmonella (38) from the department of infectious diseases, la sapienza university in rome (italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of h. influenzae,  salmonella and s. pneumoniae, more than 75% of staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of enterobacteriaceae and 50% of p.  aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for klebsiella, s. aureus and epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae. levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. regarding the distribution of resistant strains in italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as e. coli and p. aeruginosa were concerned. quality control parameters are also summarized. s. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. in fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. these results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == elimination of intraluminal colonization by antibiotic lock in silicone vascular  catheters.
AB  == an in vitro model was designed to evaluate the efficacy of instilled antimicrobials to reduce or eliminate intraluminal microbial colonization. minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration activity  of appropriate test anti-infectives were determined using standard methodology against clinically derived and reference test strains commonly associated with catheter-related infection. drug activity was validated by bioassay for the test  anti-infectives. reference and clinical test strains were inoculated to the intraluminal surface of silicone catheter segments and incubated for 30 min, after which the inoculum was replaced with total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solution and reincubated for 12 h. for 7 d, instillation of antibiotic and tpn solution was alternated every 12 h to simulate clinical conditions. on days 1, 4, and 7, catheter segments were rinsed, bisected, and sonicated for quantitative plate count to determine mean microbial counts per centimeter of catheter surface. catheter segments were also prepared for scanning electron microscopy. a significant decrease in staphylococcal intraluminal colonization after instillation of nafcillin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and vancomycin was demonstrated (p < 0.001). aztreonam, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin completely eliminated gram-negative catheter colonization (p < 0.001). yeast was eradicated  from the internal catheter surface after treatment with amphoteracin b, and fluconazole significantly decreased intraluminal colonization (p < 0.001). results show a significant decrease in staphylococcal, gram-negative, and fungal  intraluminal colonization after instillation of appropriate antimicrobial. in vitro results support early clinical success using this technique. future studies are warranted to identify optimal drug concentrations and dosing intervals.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular  components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay.  the samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pyogenes. as control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to mueller-hinton broth. in order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr.  similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in mueller hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. it seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates by use of a novel psoralen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light.
AB  == background: a photochemical treatment process has been developed for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates. this process is based on the photochemical reaction of a novel psoralen, s-59, with nucleic acids upon illumination with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). study design and methods: high levels of pathogens were added to single-donor platelet  concentrates containing 3 to 5 x 10(11) platelets in 300 ml of 35-percent autologous plasma and 65-percent platelet additive solution. after treatment with s-59 (150 microm) and uva (0-3 j/cm2), the infectivity of each pathogen was measured with established biologic assays. in vitro platelet function after photochemical treatment was evaluated during 7 days of storage by using a panel of 14 assays. the in vivo recovery and life span of photochemically treated platelets were evaluated after 24 hours of storage in a primate transfusion model. results: the following levels of pathogen inactivation were achieved: >10(6.7) plaque-forming units (pfu) per ml of cell-free human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), >10(6.6) pfu per ml of cell-associated hiv, >10(6.8) infectious dose (id50) per ml of duck hepatitis b virus (a model for hepatitis b virus), >10(6.5) pfu per ml of bovine viral diarrhea virus (a model for hepatitis c virus), >10(6.6) colony-forming units of staphylococcus epidermidis, and >10(5.6) colony-forming units of klebsiella pneumoniae. expression of integrated hiv was inhibited by 0.1 microm s-59 and 1 j per cm2 of uva. in vitro and in vivo platelet function were adequately maintained after antiviral and antibacterial treatment. conclusion: photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates offers the potential for reducing transfusion-related viral and bacterial diseases.

TI  == reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens in neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == a total of 256 swabs taken from different areas of neonatal intensive care units  (icu) in kcg hospital and amc hospital, bangalore were bacteriologically investigated for prevalence, source and spread of nosocomial bacteria. culture studies revealed growth in 217 (84.8%) swab samples indicating considerable contamination of different areas of the units and sources of infection. klebsiella pneumoniae (27.3%) was the predominant organism followed by esch coli  (16.8%), staph aureus (11.7%), staph epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.2%), enterococcus and proteus (4.7%), citrobacter freundi (3.5%) and clostridium tetani (2.4%) isolated from the equipment, cradles, other inanimate objects and environmental surfaces. out of 312 isolates, monobacterial prevalence was 43.6% in contrast to polybacterial prevalence of 56.4%. klebsiella pneumoniae (74.3%) was the predominant monobacterial isolate. the indoor air of the units was found to carry common nosocomial bacteria of 4 or more different bacterial species at dangerous levels as observed by colony counts of 15 to 30 on exposed blood agar plates. almost all sources in icu revealed the presence of klebsiella  pneumoniae, esch coli, pseudomonas and staphylococcus thus forming the potential  reservoirs of nosocomial infections to babies and this could be attributed to overcrowding, poor ventilation system and failure to follow basic principles of strict protective barrier nursing.

TI  == bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == this study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. the anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. then, the sample of  ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. the cultural rate was 60.9%. the most frequently isolated bacteria were streptococcus viridans, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis, and hemophilus parainfluenzae. conversely, only three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. the results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of  the ethmoid sinus more accurate.

TI  == rapid identification of bacterially contaminated platelets using reagent strips:  glucose and ph analysis as markers of bacterial metabolism.
AB  == background: one in every 1000 units of platelets is bacterially contaminated, which puts patients at risk for transfusion-associated sepsis and death. however, there is currently no screening test in place to detect contaminated units. the use of commercially available multiple-reagent urine dipsticks for this purpose was evaluated. study design and methods: platelet concentrates were inoculated with either sterile saline or suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, or serratia marcescens to a final concentration of 50 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml. the  platelets were analyzed daily by the use of multiple-reagent strips, quantitative culture, and glucometry. results: b cereus grew rapidly, reaching 10(7) cfu per ml 1 day after inoculation, while s. epidermidis grew slowly, achieving similar concentration 4 to 6 days after inoculation. two of 10 dipstick reagents, glucose and ph, proved useful in detecting bacteria. both were lower in bacterially contaminated units than in controls. glucose data obtained from automated analyzers validated the dipstick data. all organisms were detected at concentrations > or = 10(7) cfu per ml, and s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were detected in the range of 10(3) to 10(5) cfu per ml. conclusion: the multiple-reagent test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent (> or  = 10(7) cfu/ml) and 98 to 100 percent, respectively. these data indicate that urine dipsticks can be used to rapidly and inexpensively detect bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates, which potentially will reduce morbidity and mortality at minimal cost.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

AB  == purpose: to determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. methods: ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5-fu were determined for each organism. organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-fu (50 mg/ml) and, after  timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees c. plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. results: the mics of klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-fu used by some clinics. after incubation in 5-fu for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis-were still viable. conclusion: 5-fu has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-fu vials are used in multiple dose fashion.

TI  == [sepsis in the very low-birth-weight newborn infant].
AB  == sepsis is a common pathology during the neonatal period. low-birth weight is the  most important isolated risk factor. with the purpose of determining the prevalence of nosocomial infection in newborns of very low birth weight (vlbw), finding the microbial flora and the mortality of these patients, the authors retrospectively analysed the clinical processes of the hospitalized vlbw in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) in s. joao hospital in 1993 and 1994. of the  1091 newborns admitted to the hospital in these two years, 112 were vlbw (10%). of these, 48 had sepsis-31 (28%) confirmed sepsis and 17 (15%) probable sepsis. the agents most commonly found were staphylococcus epidermidis (44%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (21%). thirteen patients (27%) died, with infection as the  cause of death in nine (19%). our results confirm the importance of nosocomial neonatal infection, which should involve the strict observance of the asepsis norms and a proper policy of antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

AB  == objectives: to determine typical clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with hepatic abscesses, to assess outcome of treatment, and to evaluate the  role that abdominal ultrasonography has in the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses in  dogs and in monitoring response to treatment. design: retrospective case series.  animals: 14 dogs with hepatic abscesses. results: anorexia and lethargy were the  most common historical complaints, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. physical abnormalities included fever, dehydration, signs of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and mucosal bleeding. hematologic abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia. serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities and high bilirubin concentration; hypoalbuminemia and prolonged coagulation values were also reported. abdominal radiography revealed hepatomegaly, poor abdominal detail, a hepatic mass, or splenomegaly in 9 dogs. thoracic radiography revealed alveolar consolidation or mixed bronchial/interstitial pulmonary patterns in 6 dogs. hypoechoic, heteroechoic, or hyperechoic masses were identified in all dogs in which ultrasonography was performed. escherichia coli, clostridium sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus  sp, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s intermedius were the most common bacteria isolated from hepatic abscesses. concurrent infections were identified in the biliary tract, spleen, blood, endocardium, lung, prostate gland, peritoneum, lymph nodes, salivary gland, or brain of several dogs. seven dogs died or were euthanatized before definitive treatment could be initiated. one dog was successfully treated with antibiotics and was alive 12 months after medical treatment. six dogs were treated surgically (ie, full or partial liver lobectomy, drainage, abdominal lavage) and medically (ie, antibiotic administration). five of these dogs survived and were alive 12 months after surgery. ultrasonography was used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. clinical implications: hepatic abscesses are rare in dogs, but the clinical signs and clinicopathologic  findings are similar to other inflammatory hepatic disease. ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in all animals in which imaging studies were performed, and was successfully used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. medical and surgical treatments were used successfully to treat hepatic abscesses in dogs.

TI  == the potential reduction of microbial contamination of central venous catheters.
AB  == the microbial contamination of stopcock entry ports attached to central venous catheters (cvc) was determined using a specially designed swab. the swab was made of a highly porous material, porex, and was designed to fit exactly into the entry port of stopcocks. the swab was used to determine the frequency of microbial contamination of entry ports attached to cvc in patients located on an  intensive care unit. of the 200 swabs obtained 44 (22%) contained microorganisms. coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered from 43 of the swabs and diphtheroid bacilli from 1 swab. in vitro studies were carried out to investigate the efficiency of the swab in removing excess residual fluid and organisms from entry ports. the swab absorbed relatively large numbers of bacteria within seconds. when entry ports were inoculated with between 10(3) and 10(5) cfu of either staphylococcus epidermidis or klebsiella pneumoniae greater than 99% of the organisms were absorbed by the swab (p < 0.01). the absorbent swab was more efficient at removing s. epidermidis from the entry port when compared to a standard cotton swab (p < 0.01). in vitro this absorbent swab reduced the potential for catheter contamination resulting from migration of organisms from the entry port via the intraluminal route. the use of the swab in the clinical situation may reduce the incidence of cvc-related infections.

TI  == a prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  == the short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, klebsiella pneumoniae, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. in addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. the results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. on the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. this different  order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. thus, the low digestion rates of ent. faecalis and staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.

AB  == to investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. the infecting agents were gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus cohnii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and gram-negative bacilli in six patients (escherichia coli in two, klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and acinetobacter anitratus in two). in one patient, the culture results were negative. all gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. hydrocephalus  finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. no other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics  and the development of hydrocephalus was found. all patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (abk) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the abk disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of abk. the 4 category system used in japan, and  the system proposed by the japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy were studied. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml.  mic90 values of abk against staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris,  enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic90 values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. the disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disk manual. the inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with mics. results of abk disk susceptibility test with 30,  10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, p < 0.01). in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values of abk proposed are (+ + +) mic < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) mic > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) mic > 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. with 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. in the break point classification system of japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy, the mic break point for abk proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. it appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with mic values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. a pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for abk (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of abk reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == assessment of microbial growth in intravenous immune globulin preparations.
AB  == the ability of intravenous immune globulin (ivig) products to support bacterial and yeast growth was studied. microtiter plates containing preparations of eight  commercially available ivig products were inoculated with 10(5) colony-forming units (cfus) of bacteria per milliliter or 10(3) cfus of yeast cells per milliliter. the organisms used were candida albicans, torulopsis glabrata, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the plates were incubated at 3, 25, or 37 degrees c for seven days. for each organism and each temperature, a total of 16 identical wells were studied per preparation. optical density was measured at 24-hour intervals to determine bacterial growth; yeast growth was determined visually. none of the ivig preparations supported bacterial growth at any temperature over the seven-day period. no preparation supported visible yeast growth at 3 degrees c; however, most of the preparations did support yeast growth at 25 and 37 degrees c. the failure of the ivig preparations to support bacterial growth at all temperatures  and yeast growth at 3 degrees c suggests that a reconsideration of recommended expiration dates for ivig products may be warranted.

TI  == community-acquired bacteremias from tunneled central intravenous lines: results from studies of a single vendor.
AB  == tunneled central intravenous catheters are a common method for rendering prolonged outpatient intravenous therapy. their safety, however, has not been well studied. we conducted a retrospective evaluation of bacteremias associated with tunneled central intravenous catheters managed by a single home health care  vendor during a 1-year period. all catheters were inserted in the operating room  under sterile conditions. to calculate total line days, the dates of catheter insertion and removal were obtained from either the hospital operating room or the home health care agency. catheter care was conducted according to written protocols. total line days were calculated. community-acquired bacteremia (defined as bacteremia occurring more than 6 days after the patients' discharge from the hospital) was determined from records available in the infection control department. sixty-eight patients received intravenous therapy from the vendor during the 1-year study period. total line days were 5548 (median 52 days/patient). eleven episodes of bacteremia occurred in five patients, providing an incidence density rate of 2.0 infections/1000 catheter days. the most frequent bacteria encountered were staphylococcus epidermidis (five), klebsiella pneumoniae (two), and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (two). median time to bacteremia was 103 days. two patients, both younger than 4 years, accounted for seven of the infections; both had short-bowel syndrome. on the basis of historical comparisons, outpatient intravenous therapy appears to be associated with a lower risk of bacteremia than in-hospital therapy. these data can provide quality improvement information and may be a means for comparing home infusion therapy vendors.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == the effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  == the effect of a direct electric current (10 microa) on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis was investigated. when the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. the zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were  similarly affected by the application of a 10 microa electric current. a negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. the results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. this may offer  a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.

TI  == in vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  == although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. we therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative  rods against antibiotics. using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for port-a-cath-systems. organisms were obtained from  the american type culture collection (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae). all organisms but klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated pseudomonas. after 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with  various antimicrobial agents. the following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective mics of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. e. coli was found  to be the most susceptible organism. these in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.

AB  == objective: to determine the extent to which two types of infusion devices, the heparin lock and a needleless valve device, allowed the persistence of inoculated microorganisms. design: experiment. setting: clinical microbiology laboratory. outcome measures: bacterial counts in infusion devices. intervention: five of each type of device were inoculated with approximately 10(5) colony-forming units of a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes and tested for growth at seven time intervals, from 10 minutes to 72 hours after inoculation. results: both strains of bacteria were present in each device at every time interval tested, including 72 hours after inoculation. conclusions: bacteria introduced into a heparin lock or valve device may be isolated for prolonged periods of time. this suggests that if such devices are contaminated during use, they may be a potential source of infection. the risk of infection should be one major consideration in risk and benefit deliberations when choosing new products.

AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == opportunistic nosocomial multiply resistant bacterial infections--their treatment and prevention.
AB  == one of the most difficult problems confronting the clinician who deals with nosocomial infections is that of microbial resistance. the predominant nosocomial infections (urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicaemia, surgical wound infections) involve increasing numbers of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus  epidermidis, corynebacterium jeikeium or resistant enterococci as well as new multiresistant gram-negative bacilli such as xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and alcaligenes xylosoxydans. the emergence and spread of klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteriaceae producing novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases active against third-generation cephalosporins contribute to the difficulty in treating nosocomial infections.

TI  == effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. the blood was inoculated with one of five  species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per ml. the growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees c storage period of the platelet concentrates. one species, klebsiella pneumoniae,  failed to grow in any of the components. the remaining species, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by day 3. although the concentration of bacteria immediately after  inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.

TI  == continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  == bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. in e. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. on the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as s. epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such  infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in mallorca, spain, 1977-1991.
AB  == in a retrospective study at son dureta hospital (palma de mallorca, mallorca, spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. the case-fatality rate was  7.5%. infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group b streptococcus  and listeria species. the patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. from 1977 to 1984, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. group b streptococcus organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and staphylococcus  epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. the frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. invasive infection caused by candida organisms was found in two patients. the incidence of infection due to group b streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in er(iii) solution by thin-film magnetopheresis.
AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

TI  == in vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. to evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at ph of 7.2. clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. methicillin-susceptible s aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and  erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against e coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus s pneumoniae. the gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against k pneumoniae and e coli. these results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible s aureus, k  pneumoniae, and e coli. prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. in murine systemic infections, fk037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa). it was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae, except serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except mrsa and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was more  effective than cefpirome. these results correlated well with its in vitro activity. in murine local infections, with few exceptions, fk037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against klebsiella pneumonia in ed50 values and against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with staphylococcus epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with s. aureus and e. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. it is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of fk037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its  in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and p. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. in addition, the therapeutic effects of fk037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to mssa, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for mssa, 0.063 to 0.125 g for k. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for p. aeruginosa). fk037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect  (pae) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with mssa in neutropenic mice. these results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == microorganisms associated with natural fermentation of prosopis africana seeds for the production of okpiye.
AB  == okpiye is a food condiment prepared by the fermentation of prosopis africana seeds. the traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the condiment were investigated. during laboratory fermentation that lasted 96 h, the mesquite seeds underwent a natural fermentation that was characterised by the growth of microorganisms to 10(6)-10(8) cfu/g. several species of bacteria especially b. subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. megaterium, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus spp were found to be the most actively involved organisms. however, significant contributions to the microbial ecology were made by enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. lactobacillus spp were present in low numbers towards the  end of the fermentation. the presence of proteus and pseudomonas spp in traditional fermented samples demonstrate the variability which may exist in the  microflora of individual fermented samples. variations in the important microbial groups show that bacillus spp were the most prevalent species and occurred until  the end of fermentation. temperature, ph and titratable acidity varied with time  and were influenced by the metabolic activities of the microorganisms.

AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  == during the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. the frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. this was opposite to the decreased frequencies of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the isolates of p. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, staphylococcus aureus  were ranked as major pathogens. among the recent isolates of s. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. therefore, until more effective means for control of p. aeruginosa bacteremia in  particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.

TI  == development of cutaneous microflora in premature neonates.
AB  == coagulase-negative staphylococci (c-ns) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. it is likely that the strains of c-ns causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. we  have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. a swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. the numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. the species of c-ns found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. however, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. there was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. there appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. c-ns were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. other organisms isolated included propionibacterium sp,  alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, pityrosporum sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. the results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant c-ns during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

AB  == rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria,  such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid,  277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did  not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither  np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == epidemiology of beta-lactamases in africa: correlation with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in 45 centers from eight african countries, 2,888 bacterial isolates were collected from patients with community-acquired infections. isolated pathogens included staphylococcus aureus (29%), escherichia coli (20%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%), proteus species (6%), klebsiella species (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (4%). an overall sensitivity of 16.2% was shown to penicillin g (number of isolates tested = 2,467), 31.8% to ampicillin (2,687), 45% to amoxicillin (1,959), and 84.9% to cefuroxime (2,888).  beta-lactamase presence was measured by a chromogenic method. beta-lactamase was  found in 75% of all pathogens tested, including 69.5% of gram-negative and 83.3%  of gram-positive pathogens; 73% of e coli isolates, 76% of n gonorrhoeae, 75% of  klebsiella species, and 84% of s aureus were beta-lactamase positive. beta-lactamase presence was associated with bacterial resistance for penicillin g, ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but not cefuroxime, whose sensitivity remained high. the higher resistance rates and beta-lactamase prevalence in africa suggest the need for national antibiotic prescribing policies and surveillance schemes and replacement of relatively ineffective penicillins with newer agents such as cefuroxime.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  == cefpirome (cpr, hr 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. cpr was very active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae among gram-positive cocci. antibacterial activities of cpr were also strong against branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative rods. 2. the plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the t 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and t 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for cpr. 4. clinical efficacies of cpr were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. in bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. as side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of got, gpt and triglyceride. these findings indicate that cpr will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of minocycline (mino) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the mino disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the usa and europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. in this study, mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. mic80 values of mino against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. those against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic80 values against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. the inhibition zones obtained with  the disc method were compared with mics. the results of mino disc susceptibility  test either with 200 micrograms disc (showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values proposed are ( ) mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. the disc results of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results.  changing the lower 2 mic break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were  reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. the false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

AB  == the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. the broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. none of the compounds was effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of s. epidermidis strains. in biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. it did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with esch. coli. this observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. reevaluation of mic break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the reliability of the cephalothin (cet) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cet) and difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cet). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cet disc tests, which is widely used in japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. the results obtained with the disc methods were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cet disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. with the showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. with the difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. excluding enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of  mics, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (showa), and 4.4% (difco). a 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the usa and europe. mic break points proposed for the classification of the cet test are  sensitive, mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. with the showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains  (2.4%) showed false negative results. with the difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. in this study, mic70s of cet against staphylococcus aureus and  staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. cet was not so effective against gram-negative rods except klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. mic70s against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and e. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  == over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the third department of medicine, kanazawa university hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. this incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. the  rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. the frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the  first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. the majority of p. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of o-antigen  groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. on the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species, and staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide  with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins  and central venous catheters. it is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of p. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to intravenous cannulae: influence of implantation in the rabbit and of enzyme treatments.
AB  == comparison was made of the adhesion of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa to six  types of intravascular cannula material. adhesion to materials removed from rabbit tissues did not differ significantly between types of material or between  bacterial species. in contrast, major differences were found when unimplanted materials were examined; the overall rank order of adhesiveness of bacteria to unimplanted materials (s. epidermidis greater than p. aeruginosa greater than s.  aureus much greater than k. aerogenes greater than e. coli) was highly significant (f = 13.0, p less than 0.0005), and although no single material was consistently least attractive to all micro-organisms, fep-teflon and ptfe-teflon  showed significantly lower overall affinity for bacteria than other materials (p  less than 0.001); all species showed a significant preference for a silicone polymer (p less than 0.0005). the nature of the bacterial surface structures responsible for adhesion were investigated by the actions of pronase and mixed glycosidase, which produced significant respective decreases and increases in adhesion of staphylococci to unimplanted materials; their effects on the gram-negative bacilli were less consistent.

TI  == management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. we evaluated the management  of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of  catheter. seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. the catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. the most common microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group d enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms p. aeruginosa and candida albicans. based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. these findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  == the microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. phase i validated the ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose  injection and testing for recovery. phase ii validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions. phase iii compared inpatient and home tpn microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase ii. test organism inocula used in  phase i and ii were candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. all contaminated  solutions in phase i showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. all phase ii-contaminated tpn solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. one hundred postinfusion tpn samples were collected randomly during phase iii from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. none of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient tpn samples developed visible turbidity. subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. this described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates  of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.

AB  == nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (nho) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot  puncture (3). infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). in 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: staphylococcus aureus (9), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter sp. (2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == interaction of ceftriaxone with human polymorphonuclear neutrophil function.
AB  == ceftriaxone, an amino-2-thiazolyl cephalosporin, has been shown to cooperate in vitro with human neutrophils for the killing of some bacteria. in this work the direct interaction with human leucocyte bactericidal function has been studied. ceftriaxone (1000 to 1 mg/l) did not alter neutrophil chemotaxis or superoxide anion production. it also did not interfere with the chemiluminescence response of isolated pmn although a paradoxical depressive effect was observed with whole  human blood in the case of zymosan stimulation. the killing of staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae was not enhanced by ceftriaxone and phagocytosis was significantly depressed only with adherent neutrophils but not when using neutrophils in liquid medium. it is concluded that the synergy observed between leucocyte and ceftriaxone for bacterial killing cannot be related to a direct stimulation of neutrophil functions and should depend on bacterial alteration.

AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

AB  == infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. in a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees c, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). median age was 7 years (2 months-16  years). in patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was  added after 48 hours. the effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. the first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. bacteria were isolated in 39 children: escherichia coli: 9, staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, staphylococcus aureus: 8, streptococcus: 6, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, haemophilus: 1, klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, proteus: 1, serratia: 1, flavobacterium: 1. in these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and  netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. all blood culture were negative after the first combination. the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). there were no death, no superinfection. tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. we conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

AB  == the effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. in contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == bacterial contamination of ambulance oxygen humidifier water reservoirs: a potential source of pulmonary infection.
AB  == the risk and benefit of oxygen humidification during ambulance transport is unknown. we cultured the water in plastic multiple-use bottles of humidifiers on  30 randomly selected area ambulances during november 1985. there were 22 positive cultures. potentially pathogenic bacteria (four pseudomonas maltophilia, three pseudomonas aeruginosa, one klebsiella pneumoniae, and one staphylococcus epidermidis) were found in nine samples. assuming that the water in ambulance humidifiers should have been sterile, the findings are statistically significant  (p less than .01). because there is no evidence that humidification is of benefit for nonintubated patients receiving oxygen at flow rates of 4 l/min or less when  environmental humidity is adequate, we suggest that such patients should receive  oxygen without humidification during ambulance transport. all other patients requiring oxygen during ambulance transport should continue to receive humidified oxygen. if a multiple-use humidifier reservoir is to be used, a written policy for its use must be developed and there must be appropriate documentation of compliance with the policy. an alternative is to replace the multiple-use humidifier reservoir with single-use sterile disposable devices, which cost approximately $2.00 per unit.

TI  == the nosocomial colonization of t. bear.
AB  == a national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the national institutes of health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. the program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (t. bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. one of the items used is a stuffed toy t. bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the t. bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. a prospective study of 39 sterilized t. bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. hospital acquired organisms cultured from the t. bear included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, corynebacterium acnes, micrococcus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus sp, and species of candida, cryptococcus, trichosporon, aspergillus and others. concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. although the t. bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  == parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. a variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. the exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may  all play some role. controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions,  attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. in addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks  associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

AB  == population analyses of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) and desacetyl-cefotaxime (dctx) of strains of staphylococcus and some genera of enterobacteriaceae were carried out. dctx, which is the main metabolite of ctx, has antimicrobial activity. the penicillinase-producing strains of s. aureus and  s. epidermidis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to both agents. ctx was about 4-8 times more active than dctx. the methicillin-resistant strains contained a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both ctx and dctx. the frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-6) - 10(-5). the e. coli strain was homogeneous to both agents. the strains of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii had a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both agents. the frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-7) - 10(-4.5). in klebsiella pneumoniae no resistant sub-population was found. ctx was about four times more active than  dctx with the strains of the enterobacteriaceae. dctx had no advantage over ctx as regards homogeneity of susceptibility of the populations examined. ctx seems applicable for treatment of infections with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and penicillinase-producing, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus, but should not be used alone in treatments of infections with enterobacter cloacae or citrobacter freundii.

TI  == the relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  == one potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. between july 1, 1981, and march 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean,  elective arterial reconstructive procedures. control cultures were obtained from  adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0  of 20) (p less than 0.001). the most common organism cultured was staphylococcus  epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). our overall graft infection rate since january 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). all three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). these patients with culture-positive graft infections  were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with  negative arterial cultures. positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). these data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  == since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, alcaligenes faecalis, neisseria meningitidis and species of salmonella, enterobacter, pseudomonas and providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. at concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. however, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. growth  in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. the results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron  which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.

TI  == the turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  == ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 klett-summerson colorimeter units. the suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees c. turbidities for proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of e-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of e-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and  gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. e-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (mic50) of 25 micrograms for staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with streptococcus faecalis resistant. e-0702 had mic50s against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but mic90s were higher than those of the other agents. it was as active as the other  agents against proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, providencia spp., morganella spp., and proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. activity against bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. e-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. there was an inoculum effect for e. cloacae, serratia spp., morganella spp., and pseudomonas spp.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in intensive care unit areas.
AB  == the incidence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance rates of nosocomial pathogens vary considerably among countries and even among intensive care units (icus) within one hospital. such differences might be partly due to the selection pressure exerted by certain antibiotics, since intensive care patients are given more antimicrobials than any other group of patients. we therefore compared resistance rates of four important nosocomial pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients in general wards and icus. there were few trends toward higher resistance of icu isolates, and most differences were found with klebsiella pneumoniae. we also tried to relate antibiotic use in icus and frequency of antibiotic resistance of five selected nosocomial pathogens. the ampicillin and cephalosporin resistance of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae arose along with an increase in usage of both drugs. decreasing prescription of cotrimoxazole was not reflected by decrease in resistance of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. increasing prescriptions of tetracyclines  were followed by an increasing resistance of e. coli, but not of staphylococci. the oxacillin resistance of staphylococcus epidermidis almost paralleled the consumption, the opposite was true for staphylococcus aureus. there seemed to be  a rather close relationship between the incidence of resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and the quantities of gentamicin, tobramycin and azlocillin prescribed. the increase or decrease of prescriptions of certain antimicrobials increased or decreased their  resistance rate to the respective drugs of only certain bacterial strains in one  icu, but not in the other. the findings in our hospital cannot necessarily be applied to other hospitals.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. it inhibited haemophilus and neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime,  moxalactam, or ceftazidime against escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia spp., and serratia spp. cefotaxime-resistant enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type i beta-lactamases.

AB  == the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid,  code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.

AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == the clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. i. laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  == five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. the isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including clostridium species, often represented contamination. more than 99% of  all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. the five most common isolates were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; s. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi  were especially common nosocomial pathogens. the microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. the most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. after antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.

AB  == patients with bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) were prospectively studied using monoclonal antibody reagents to  assess alterations in t-lymphocyte subpopulations. patients with endocarditis had significantly higher ratios of t-helper (okt4+) to t-suppressor-cytotoxic (okt8+) cells than did patients with bacteremia alone. staphylococcus aureus endocarditis patients had a mean ratio of 8.49 (range 4.73-22.36) while s aureus bacteremia had a mean ratio of 2.75 (range 2.15 to 3.21). similar results were found with staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis (mean 1.62) and bacteremia (mean 1.23). klebsiella pneumoniae endocarditis (5.10) and sepsis (4.32), and e coli bacteremia (2.15). nine male patients with aids had markedly depressed ratios (mean 0.25, range 0.04 to 0.67) while eight male homosexuals with unexplained lymphadenopathy ("pre-aids") had normal or increased ratios. bacteremic infections are associated with an increased okt4+/okt8+ ratio with the degree of  increase dependent upon virulence, location, and duration of infection. the immunomodulating effects of infection are manifested in changes in t-cell subsets, and these measurements can be useful in clinical management.

TI  == detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. to determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. each of six bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (candida albicans, candida tropicalis, and torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and macconkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. however, subcultures onto sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with p. aeruginosa). in a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with c. albicans and bacteremia with p. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of p. aeruginosa. therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to  detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.

TI  == role of lymphatic vessels in bacterial clearance from early soft-tissue infection.
AB  == a popular concept regarding the pathophysiologic characteristics of infection is  that early bacterial clearance from tissue is an important host defense mechanism. staphylococcus aureus, s epidermidis, escherichia coli, enterococcus,  and klebsiella pneumoniae were radiolabeled with tritiated thymidine and injected subcutaneously into rabbit ears. negligible clearance occurred at five hours, and less than 30% of injected bacteria cleared in 24 hours. lymphatic function measured by clearance with bovine serum albumin labeled with iodine 125 was normal at all times during the first 24 hours. clearance of live s aureus, radiolabeled by tritiated thymidine, was not accelerated by preexisting 12- or 24-hour hold-old inflammatory lesions. clearance of bacteria rendered nonviable in vitro by antibiotics and heat were cleared in proportion to the degree of bacterial cell lysis. bacterial clearance of s aureus correlated with the rate of bacterial lysis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro. these data support the  hypothesis that lymphatic clearance of bacteria from soft tissues is of negligible importance as a host defense mechanism in the decisive period of soft-tissue infection.

AB  == the activities in vitro of ceftazidime and of cefuroxime have been compared against 201 strains of bacteria which had been isolated either from outbreaks of  nosocomial infection or were typical of strains causing such outbreaks. ceftazidime was found to be about 1000 times more active against pseudomonas spp. and proteus vulgaris, and between 10 and 100 times more active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus rettgeri, proteus morganii, providencia stuartii, alcaligenes faecalis and acinetobacter spp. on the other hand, cefuroxime was more active against staphylococcus epidermidis. an increase in inoculum size to 106 had little effect on the activity of ceftazidime, except in the case of pr. vulgaris strains, which grew, although only to a very limited extent, even in the presence of high concentrations of ceftazidime. anaerobic and hypercapnic conditions did not adversely affect the activity of ceftazidime. our in-vitro results thus indicate  that ceftazidime had as broad a spectrum as gentamicin, and is more intrinsically active.

AB  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than  ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it  a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  == the bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four  specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. no bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. the total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 candida albicans. of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. a higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. more isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. the rate of isolation staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with  increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and propionibacterium acnes increased,  and the rate of isolation of escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  == single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to  determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. at heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 u/ml, the effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter spp. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. all 10 isolates of s. aureus and all 10 of s. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 u/ml. three e. coli, four p. aeruginosa, and nine c. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 u of heparin per ml. none of the k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 u/ml. heparin inhibition  of s. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 u of heparin per ml could be  quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. these data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.

TI  == is there a specific stimulus of infectious-allergic bronchial asthma?
AB  == 1. pigmented neisseria species (neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca) are constant inhabitants of patients with infectious asthma. 2. of all the diverse bronchial microflora of patients with infectious-allergic bronchial asthma, the pigmented neisseria species (neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca), staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis), klebsiella (klebsiella pneumoniae) are active sensitizers of the human broncho-pulmonary tract. 3. neisseria strains, possessing similar antigenic determinants to human lung tissues, possess the highest allergenic activity. this raises the question of a new criterion for evaluating the allergenicity of cultures according to their antigenic characteristics. 4. in patients with infectious asthma allergy might develop to some of the structures of microbial cells, in which antigenic determinants, similar to human lung tissues are localized.

AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.

TI  == quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  == a widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, triton x-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. we determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. the shortest-lived was streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. all of the others (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. k. pneumoniae, the  only gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.

TI  == effects of intestinal micro-organisms on fluid and electrolyte transport in the jejunum of the rat.
AB  == culture filtrates of micro-organisms isolated from the upper intestinal secretions of malnourished children and grown in pure culture were shown to impair the intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes in live rats. decreased net movement out of the intestinal lumen, or actual secretion of water, sodium or potassium into the intestinal lumen, was found with culture filtrates of single isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli 055, escherichia coli b7a, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and candida tropicalis. these organisms have been found to contaminate upper intestinal secretions in malnourished children and it is suggested that the effects observed in these experiments might be relevant to the production of the  diarrhoea that is a dominant clinical feature of childhood malnutrition.

TI  == quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  == quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were  counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. these plates were incubated at 37 degrees c overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. after this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. these plates were incubated again at 37 degrees c overnight. the minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. the lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. when compared for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia  marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.

(1) pc-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. the serum peak level of pc-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and t 1/2 of pc-904 was 67.8 minutes. pc-904 was  administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and t 1/2 of pc-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20  mg/kg. in a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg,  the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) pc-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and  bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans, acinetobacter anitratus and hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared  by the treatment of pc-904, and hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of pc-904. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) as to the side effect by pc-904, s-got and s-gpt were elevated in 2 cases. anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.

TI  == studies on the immune response in chickens i. effect of various immunization procedures on the primary and secondary antibody responses to bovine serum albumin.
AB  == antibody response and generation of immunological memory in chickens after stimulation by bovine serum albumin (bsa) were investigated. a single intravenous injection of bsa induced a relatively high primary antibody response but failed to generate definite memory for the secondary antibody response. variation in antigen dosage and the time interval between antigen injections did not affect significantly the levels of the primary and secondary antibody responses. the immunogenicity of deaggregated bsa in chickens was as potent as that of aggregated bsa. soluble adjuvants such as the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae, cell wall lipopolysaccharide of salmonella enteritidis and cell wall peptidoglycan of staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited little enhancing  effect on antibody response and memory. however, stimulation of chickens by bsa emulsified in freund's adjuvant enhanced generation of memory. repeated injection of bsa alone also showed a similar effect. it seems likely therefore that in chickens continous antigenic stimulation is required for generation of definite memory. from the present results it has been concluded that the characteristics of the immune response of chickens to bsa resemble those of mammals to t-independent antigens.

TI  == ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against klebsiella pneumoniae (p less than .001), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (p less than .001) and aeromonas hydrophilia (p less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for staphylococcus aureus (p less than .001), streptococcus agalactiae (p less than .001), staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .001) and streptococcus viridans (p less than .005). significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
