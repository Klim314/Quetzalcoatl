TI  == bacteria-induced intracellular signalling in platelets.
AB  == multiple studies have now shown that various species of bacteria can stimulate platelets; many in a strain and donor-dependent manner. the signalling pathways underlying this platelet activation has been the subject of scrutiny for the last decade. the best-delineated pathway is that in response to streptococcal species, such as streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis), streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii) and streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), where a pathway is initiated by the engagement of the low affinity igg receptor, fcgammariia. this leads to and involves the tyrosine kinase syk, the adaptor protein linker of activated t cells (lat) and subsequently both phospholipase cgamma2 (plcgamma2) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi-3-k). finally, this leads to the expression of  the alphaiibbeta3 integrin, the synthesis and release of thromboxane a2 (t x a2)  and the exocytosis of pf4, each of which plays a crucial role in secondary signalling and full platelet activation. roles for other signalling pathways in streptococcal-induced platelet activation are less clear, although an adp-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a glycoprotein ib/ix/v-mediated pathway and perhaps a complement-induced pathway have each been proposed. platelet activation by porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) at least partially shares the fcgammariia/syk/plcgamma2/pi-3-k mechanism utilised by streptococcal species. however, it has also been suggested that p. gingivalis activates platelets by two additional methods; stimulation of the protease-activated receptors leading to activation of phospholipase cbeta (plcbeta), and the engagement of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by released lipopolysaccharide leading to an ill-defined pathway which may involve pi-3-k. consequently, it appears that bacteria can stimulate platelets by eliciting multiple signalling pathways some of which are common, and some unique, to individual species.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  == introduction: alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. the aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (s1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (s2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (s3). methods: bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root  canals. samples were inoculated into culture media at a ph of 9 and incubated anaerobically. the identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16s ribosomal rna sequencing. results: all s1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a ph of 9. gram-positive bacteria pseudoramibacter  alactolyticus and streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. of 13 culture-positive s2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a ph of 9, namely streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cancerogenus, streptococcus oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at s1. all 3 culture-positive s3 samples tolerated a ph of 9, namely s. sanguinis and e. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding s1 and s2 samples. conclusions: we showed that the  presence of alkaline-tolerant streptococcus and enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal  treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == bacteremia after piezocision.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after a piezocision procedure. methods: the sample consisted of 30 subjects (24 women, 6 men; mean age, 19.6 +/- 0.7 years; range, 18.1-22.4 years)  with the american society of anesthesiologists' physical status i. all patients had class i skeletal and dental relationships and had fixed orthodontic treatment with the damon system. the piezocision surgery was performed 1 week after the placement of the orthodontic appliances in all patients. two 20-ml venous blood samples were collected before and 30 to 60 seconds after the first microincision  using an aseptic technique. the samples were inoculated into bactec plus aerobic  and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were assessed in the bactec blood culture analyzer (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, sparks, md). the results were analyzed statistically using the mcnemar test, with p <0.05 indicating statistical significance. results: no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative samples was determined with respect to transient bacteremia (p = 0.250). no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment  samples, although gemella sanguinis, streptococcus pluranimalium, and streptococcus mitis/oralis were detected in 3 postoperative blood samples. conclusions: the piezocision procedure might be related to transitory bacteremia. hence, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when piezocision is part of the treatment plan.

TI  == neuraminidase-producing oral mitis group streptococci potentially contribute to influenza viral infection and reduction in antiviral efficacy of zanamivir.
AB  == influenza is a serious respiratory disease among immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly, and its prevention is an urgent social issue. influenza viruses rely on neuraminidase (na) activity to release progeny viruses from infected cells and spreading the infection. na is, therefore, an important target of anti-influenza drugs. a causal relationship between bacteria and influenza virus infection has not yet been established, however, a positive correlation between them has been reported. thus, in this study, we examined the biological effects of oral mitis group streptococci, which are predominant constituents of human oral florae, on the release of influenza viruses. among them, streptococcus oralis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mitis atcc 6249 were found to exhibit na activity and their culture supernatants promoted the release of influenza virus and cell-to-cell spread of the infection. in addition, culture supernatants of these na-producing oral bacteria increased viral m1 protein expression levels and cellular erk activation. these effects were not observed with culture supernatants of streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556 which lacks the ability to produce na. although the na inhibitor zanamivir suppressed the release of progeny viruses from the infected cells, the viral release was restored upon the addition of culture supernatants of na-producing s. oralis atcc 10557 or s. mitis atcc 6249. these findings suggest that an increase in the number of na-producing oral  bacteria could elevate the risk of and exacerbate the influenza infection, hampering the efficacy of viral na inhibitor drugs.

TI  == adherence of human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to nano-structured titanium surfaces.
AB  == background: a key element for long-term success of dental implants is integration of the implant surface with the surrounding host tissues. modification of titanium implant surfaces can enhance osteoblast activity but their effects on soft-tissue cells are unclear. adherence of human keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to control commercially pure titanium (cpti) and two surfaces prepared by anodic oxidation was therefore investigated. since implant abutments  are exposed to a bacteria-rich environment in vivo, the effect of oral bacteria on keratinocyte adhesion was also evaluated. methods: the surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (sem). the number of adhered cells and binding strength, as well as vitality of fibroblasts and keratinocytes  were evaluated using confocal scanning laser microscopy after staining with live/dead baclight. to evaluate the effect of bacteria on adherence and vitality, keratinocytes were co-cultured with a four-species streptococcal consortium. results: sem analysis showed the two anodically oxidized surfaces to be nano-structured with differing degrees of pore-density. over 24 hours, both fibroblasts and keratinocytes adhered well to the nano-structured surfaces, although to a somewhat lesser degree than to cpti (range 42-89% of the levels on  cpti). the strength of keratinocyte adhesion was greater than that of the fibroblasts but no differences in adhesion strength could be observed between the two nano-structured surfaces and the cpti. the consortium of commensal streptococci markedly reduced keratinocyte adherence on all the surfaces as well  as compromising membrane integrity of the adhered cells. conclusion: both the vitality and level of adherence of soft-tissue cells to the nano-structured surfaces was similar to that on cpti. co-culture with streptococci reduced the number of keratinocytes on all the surfaces to approximately the same level and caused cell damage, suggesting that commensal bacteria could affect adherence of  soft-tissue cells to abutment surfaces in vivo.

TI  == crystalline anatase-rich titanium can reduce adherence of oral streptococci.
AB  == dental implant abutments that emerge through the mucosa are rapidly covered with  a salivary protein pellicle to which bacteria bind, initiating biofilm formation. in this study, adherence of early colonizing streptococci, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis to two saliva-coated anodically oxidized surfaces was compared with that on commercially pure titanium (cpti). near edge x-ray absorption (nexafs) showed crystalline anatase was more pronounced on the anodically oxidized surfaces than  on the cpti. as revealed by fluorescence microscopy, a four-species mixture, as well as individual bacterial species, exhibited lower adherence after 2 h to the  saliva-coated, anatase-rich surfaces than to cpti. since wettability did not differ between the saliva-coated surfaces, differences in the concentration and/or configuration of salivary proteins on the anatase-rich surfaces may explain the reduced bacterial binding effect. anatase-rich surfaces could thus contribute to reduced overall biofilm formation on dental implant abutments through diminished adherence of early colonizers.

TI  == amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by fcgammariia, integrin alphaiibbeta3, and platelet factor 4.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to platelets is mediated via a range of strain-specific bacterial surface proteins that bind to a variety of platelet receptors. it is unclear how these interactions lead to platelet activation. we demonstrate a critical role for the immune receptor fcgammariia, alphaiibbeta3, and src and syk tyrosine kinases in platelet activation by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. fcgammariia activation is dependent on immunoglobulin g (igg) and alphaiibbeta3 engagement. moreover, feedback agonists adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thromboxane a2 are mandatory for platelet aggregation. additionally, platelet factor 4 (pf4) binds to bacteria and reduces the lag time for aggregation, and gray platelet syndrome alpha-granule-deficient platelets do not aggregate to 4 of 5 bacterial strains. we propose that fcgammariia-mediated activation is a common  response mechanism used against a wide range of bacteria, and that release of secondary mediators and pf4 serve as a positive feedback mechanism for activation through an igg-dependent pathway.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide contributes to the epithelial cell death induced by the oral mitis group of streptococci.
AB  == members of the mitis group of streptococci are normal inhabitants of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans. some mitis group species, such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis, are primary colonizers of the human oral cavity. recently, we found that hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by s. oralis is cytotoxic to human macrophages, suggesting that streptococcus-derived h2o2 may act as a cytotoxin. since epithelial cells provide a physical barrier against pathogenic microbes, we investigated their susceptibility to infection by h2o2-producing streptococci in  this study. infection by s. oralis and s. sanguinis was found to stimulate cell death of detroit 562, calu-3 and hela epithelial cell lines at a multiplicity of  infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition  of h2o2, inhibited s. oralis cytotoxicity, and h2o2 alone was capable of eliciting epithelial cell death. moreover, s. oralis mutants lacking the spxb gene encoding pyruvate oxidase, which are deficient in h2o2 production, exhibited reduced cytotoxicity toward detroit 562 epithelial cells. in addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that both s. oralis and h2o2 induced  interleukin-6 production in detroit 562 epithelial cells. these results suggest that streptococcal h2o2 is cytotoxic to epithelial cells, and promotes bacterial  evasion of the host defense systems in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tracts.

TI  == genetic basis of coaggregation receptor polysaccharide biosynthesis in streptococcus sanguinis and related species.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between streptococci and actinomyces promotes early dental plaque biofilm development. recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) on strains of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis by actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of rps (rps) and rps precursors (rml, gale1 and gale2) in s. gordonii 38 and s. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. to determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified  and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these  species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, s. sanguinis. genes for synthesis of rps precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. hence, rml genes for synthesis of tdp-l-rha were in rps loci of s.  oralis strains but at other loci in s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. hence, gale1 for epimerization of udp-glc and udp-gal was in galactose operons of s. gordonii and  s. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in s. oralis. moreover, gale2 for epimerization of both udp-glc and udp-gal and udp-glcnac and  udp-galnac was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of s.  sanguinis. the findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different rps-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. a cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental  caries. herbal extracts such as cudrania tricuspidata, sophora flavescens, ginkgo biloba, and betula schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of s. mutans. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, and s. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of clinical and laboratory standard institute. also, s. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and  8-well chamber glass slip using bhi broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. the biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable s. mutans by counting colony forming units. planktonic s. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and s. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of s. flavescens. the normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to s. mutans. s. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. in conclusion, the extract of s. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.

TI  == [a novel typing method and scheme for streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == study aim: to introduce a novel molecular pcr method for the typing of streptococcus pneumonia in the national reference laboratory (nrl) for streptococcal infections. material and methods: strains of streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the nrl from different regions of the czech republic.  generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the quellung reaction.  since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mpcr) assay has been introduced. the novel assay was tested on 210 s. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species s. pseudopneumoniae, s. sanguinis, and s. oralis. results: the nrl for streptococcal infections has included a novel mpcr assay in  the algorithm of s. pneumoniae identification and typing. the mpcr assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the  isolates of the related species remaining negative. the mpcr assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. the pcr appeared to be an excellent tool for s. pneumoniae typing. conclusion: until recently, s. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (quellung reaction), but the nrl for streptococcal infections has switched to a novel mpcr assay. this molecular tool improves s. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate.

AB  == aim: to compare early bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro by different oral streptococci on a variety of commercial brackets. methods: adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro of 6 streptococcus spp. on 15 different commercial brackets, in standard culture medium and in human saliva were evaluated by the mtt reduction assay. results: significant differences were evidenced in both early adhesion and biofilm formation among the studied brackets and between the two conditions of growth. gold brackets resulted less prone to colonisation compared to composite brackets. the growth rates of the tested species on the different tested materials were significantly different. conclusion: the adopted experimental plan, dissecting the two phases of plaque formation on different brackets in different conditions, showed that composite brackets are more susceptible to adhesion and colonisation by streptococci, while the remaining tested brackets did not show differences that could be clinically relevant. data suggest that different personal behaviours affecting the oral environment could significantly affect colonisation of brackets by oral streptococci.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == incidence of bacteriocins produced by food-related lactic acid bacteria active towards oral pathogens.
AB  == in the present study we investigated the incidence of bacteriocins produced by 236 lactic acid bacteria (lab) food isolates against pathogenic or opportunistic  pathogenic oral bacteria. this set of lab contained several strains (>/=17%) producing bacteriocins active against food-related bacteria. interestingly only streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was able to inhibit the growth of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, while lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 and lactobacillus plantarun aca-dc 269 produced bacteriocins solely against streptococcus oralis. thus, the percentage of strains that were found to produce bacteriocins against oral bacteria was ~1.3%. the rarity of bacteriocins active against oral lab pathogens produced by food-related lab was unexpected given their close phylogenetic relationship. nevertheless, when tested in inhibition assays, the potency of the bacteriocin(s) of s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 against the three oral streptococci was high. fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis revealed that exposure of the target cells to the antimicrobial compounds caused major alterations of key cellular constituents. our findings indicate that bacteriocins produced by food-related lab against oral lab may be rare, but deserve further investigation since, when discovered, they can be effective antimicrobials.

AB  == the peptide lys-[trp(6)]-hy-a1 (lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  hy-a1, initially isolated from the frog species hypsiboas albopunctatus. according to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity  of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 (kifgaiwplalgalknlik-nh2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. the methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. the microorganisms streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 37 degrees c under atmospheric pressure with 10% co2. the peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug ml(-1)). chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and bhi culture medium was used as the negative control. the tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. thus, the peptide lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == initial in vitro bacterial adhesion on dental restorative materials.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate initial bacterial adhesion  on several restorative materials with similar roughness. materials and methods: sixty cylindrical slabs were prepared from four restorative materials: zirconia (zr), alumina-toughened zirconia (al-zr), type iii gold alloy (au), and cp-titanium (ti). all the materials were polished until a mirror-like shine was achieved. the average surface roughness and topography were determined by atomic  force microscopy. contact angles were measured to calculate surface free energy by the sessile drop technique. after the formation of a salivary pellicle, s. sanguinis, s. gordonii, and s. oralis were inoculated onto the specimens and incubated for 4 h. quantification of the adherent bacteria was performed by crystal violet staining technique and resazurin reduction assay. one-way anova and tukey's post hoc test were adopted for statistical analysis. the level of significance was 0.05. results: the ra values determined with atomic force microscopy for all specimens were lower than 5 nm. surface free energy increased  in the order of al-zr, zr, ti, and au. differences were significant between the investigated materials in both crystal violet absorbance and fluorescence intensities. gold alloy showed the highest values for all bacterial strains (p<0.05). conclusions: zirconia, alumina-toughened zirconia, and titanium may be  more suitable than gold alloy as an abutment material with respect to the initial bacterial adhesion and subsequent advance of peri-implantitis.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == effect of penicillin g every three weeks on oral microflora by penicillin resistant viridans streptococci.
AB  == background: benzathine penicillin g every 3 weeks is the standard protocol for secondary prophylaxis for recurrent rheumatic fever. objective: assess the effect of benzathine penicillin g on streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus oralis in patients with cardiac valvular disease due to rheumatic fever receiving secondary prophylaxis. methods: oral streptococci were evaluated before (baseline) and after 7 days (day 7) with benzathine penicillin g in 100 patients receiving routine secondary rheumatic fever prophylaxis. saliva samples were evaluated for  colony count and presence of s. sanguinis and s. oralis. chewing-stimulated saliva samples were serially diluted and plated onto both nonselective and selective 5% sheep blood agar containing penicillin g. the species were identified using conventional biochemical tests. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined with the etest. results: no statistical differences were found in the presence of s. sanguinis comparing baseline and day 7 (p = 0.62). however, the existing number of positive cultures of s. oralis on day 7 after benzathine penicillin g presented a significant increase compared to  baseline (p = 0.04). no statistical difference was found between baseline and day 7 concerning the number of s. sanguinis or s. oralis cfu/ml and median minimal inhibitory concentrations. conclusion: this study showed that benzathine penicillin g every 3 weeks did not change the colonization by s. sanguinis, but increased colonization of s. oralis on day 7 of administration. therefore, susceptibility of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus oralis to penicillin  g was not modified during the penicillin g routine secondary rheumatic fever prophylaxis.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == amoxicillin-resistant oral streptococci identified in dental plaque specimens from healthy japanese adults.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis (ie) is known to be a life-threatening disease and invasive dental procedures are considered to be important factors. oral amoxicillin (ampc) is widely used for prophylaxis in patients with heart disorders who are at risk for ie. however, there is only limited information regarding the inhibition of oral bacteria by ampc. methods and results: dental plaque specimens were obtained from 120 healthy japanese adult subjects, then diluted and streaked onto selective medium for oral streptococci. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ampc was evaluated using a macro-dilution method by clinical laboratory standard institute (2006). seven strains with an mic of ampc of 16mug/ml or more were isolated from 5 subjects. the bacterial species were confirmed by sequence analysis of 16s rrna from each strain, which demonstrated that most were streptococcus sanguinis, followed by streptococcus oralis. dental plaque specimens collected from these 5 subjects again after an interval of 2-3 months possessed no strains with an mic of ampc of 16mug/ml or more. conclusions: these findings suggest that strains with a high mic of ampc are present in the oral cavities of japanese adults, though they may be transient rather than inhabitants.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == the cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to  induce dental caries. xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of s. mutans. however, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in s. mutans. the aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of xylitol-resistant (x(r)) s. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (x(s)) and x(r) s. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. when x(s) or x(r) s. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, x(r)s. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to x(s) s. mutans. the coaggregation between x(r) s. mutans and s, gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis or s. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of x(s) s. mutans in the presence of sucrose. however, there was no difference in the coaggregation between x(r) and x(s) s. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. the level of gtfb and gtfc mrna expression of x(r) s. mutans was lower than that of x(s) s. mutans, whilst the level of gtfd mrna expression did not differ between the two strains. the reduction of biofilm formation in x(s) s. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that x(r) s. mutans may be less cariogenic than x(s) s. mutans.

TI  == synergistic interaction between candida albicans and commensal oral streptococci  in a novel in vitro mucosal model.
AB  == candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans, where it coexists with highly diverse bacterial communities. it is not clear whether this interaction limits or promotes the potential of c. albicans to become an opportunistic pathogen. here we investigate the interaction between c.  albicans and three species of streptococci from the viridans group, which are ubiquitous and abundant oral commensal bacteria. the ability of c. albicans to form biofilms with streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, or streptococcus gordonii was investigated using flow cell devices that allow abiotic biofilm formation under salivary flow. in addition, we designed a novel flow cell system that allows mucosal biofilm formation under conditions that mimic the environment in the oral and esophageal mucosae. it was observed that c. albicans and streptococci formed a synergistic partnership where c. albicans promoted the ability of streptococci to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces or on the surface of an oral mucosa analogue. the increased ability of streptococci to  form biofilms in the presence of c. albicans could not be explained by a growth-stimulatory effect since the streptococci were unaffected in their growth  in planktonic coculture with c. albicans. conversely, the presence of streptococci increased the ability of c. albicans to invade organotypic models of the oral and esophageal mucosae under conditions of salivary flow. moreover, characterization of mucosal invasion by the biofilm microorganisms suggested that the esophageal mucosa is more permissive to invasion than the oral mucosa. in summary, c. albicans and commensal oral streptococci display a synergistic interaction with implications for the pathogenic potential of c. albicans in the  upper gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == antibiotic modulation of the plasminogen binding ability of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the ability of viridans group streptococci to bind human plasminogen and its subsequent activation into plasmin may contribute to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (ie) by leading to a decreased stability of the streptococcal vegetation and facilitating dehiscence of emboli. at levels greater than or equal to their mics, penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid are efficacious in the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. however, at sub-mics, antibiotics can modulate the expression of bacterial genes, including virulence-associated genes, which can have counterproductive effects on the treatment of endocarditis. the effects of 1/8x and 1/4x mics of penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid on the plasminogen binding ability of ie isolates streptococcus mitis 881/956, streptococcus oralis 12601, and streptococcus sanguinis 12403 were assessed phenotypically and the expression of plasminogen receptors alpha-enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of s. oralis 12601 when exposed to 1/4x mic of penicillin, was analyzed through quantitative reverse transcription (qrt)-pcr. the plasminogen binding ability of s. mitis 881/956 and s. sanguinis 12403 remained unaffected by exposure to sub-mics of all of the antibiotics tested, while that of s. oralis 12601 was significantly enhanced by all of the antibiotics tested at sub-mics. qrt-pcr analysis of s. oralis 12601 demonstrated an upregulation of the eno and gapdh genes, indicating  an overexpression of plasminogen receptors. these findings suggest that for some  endocarditis isolates, the effect of antibiotic sub-mics, in addition to a reduced antibacterial effect, may influence the clinical response to nonsurgical  therapy. it remains difficult to accurately predict isolate responses to sub-mic  antimicrobials since there appears to be interspecies variation.

AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == thermal treatments modulate bacterial adhesion to dental enamel.
AB  == numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of laser-induced heat on demineralization of enamel; however, no studies have investigated the link between heat/laser-induced changes in physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. in this study, we investigated the effects of thermal treatment on surface properties of enamel such as hydrophobicity and zeta potential. bacterial adhesion to treated surfaces was characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and adhesion force was quantified by atomic force microscopy. the hydrophobicity of enamel increased after heating (p < 0.05), and the zeta potential of heated enamel became more negative than that of the control (p < 0.01). streptococcus oralis and s. mitis were more hydrophilic than s. sanguis, with more negative zeta potential (all p < 0.01). s. mitis and s. oralis occupied significantly less area on enamel after being heated (p < 0.05). heating reduced  the adhesion force of both s. mitis and s. oralis to enamel with or without saliva coating. reduction of adhesion force was statistically significant for s.  mitis (p < 0.01), whereas that of s. oralis was not statistically significant (p  > 0.05). heating did not affect the adhesion of s. sanguis with or without saliva coating. in conclusion, thermal treatment and photothermal/laser treatments may modulate the physicochemical properties of enamel, preventing the adhesion of some bacterial species.

TI  == clonal structure of streptococcus sanguinis strains isolated from endocarditis cases and the oral cavity.
AB  == a collection of streptococcus sanguinis strains from patients with endocarditis (n = 21) and from the oral cavity (n = 34) was subjected to a multi-locus sequence typing analysis using seven housekeeping genes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (carb), co/zn/cd efflux system component (czcd), d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (ddl), dna polymerase iii (dnax), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (gdh), dna-directed rna polymerase, beta subunit (rpob) and superoxide dismutase (soda). the scheme was expanded by the inclusion of two the putative virulence genes, bacitracin-resistance protein (baca) and saliva-binding protein (ssab), to increase strain discrimination. extensive intra-species recombination was apparent in all genes but inter-species recombination was also apparent with strains apparently harbouring gdh and ddl from unidentified sources and one isolate harboured a soda allele apparently derived from streptococcus oralis. the recombination/mutation ratio for the concatenated housekeeping gene sequences was 1.67 (95% confidence limits 1.25-2.72) and for the two virulence genes the r/m ratio was 3.99 (95% confidence limits 1.61-8.72); recombination was the major driver for genetic variation. all isolates were distinct and the endocarditis strains did not form distinct sub-clusters when the data were analysed using clonalframe. these data support the widely held opinion that infecting s. sanguinis strains are opportunistic human pathogens.

TI  == erythromycin and penicillin resistance mechanisms among viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive potential of a biosurfactant rufisan produced by  candida lipolytica ucp 0988.
AB  == in the last years, researches developed with biosurfactants for application in the medical area have been revealing the promising biological activities of these biomolecules. in this work the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of a biosurfactant rufisan isolated from the yeast candida lipolytica ucp 0988, growth in a medium supplemented with ground nut refinery residue was determined against  several microorganisms. the biosurfactant was able to reduce the water surface tension from 70 to 25.3 mn/m and showed a critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.03%. the biosurfactant was isolated after 72 h of fermentation and was tested in concentrations varying from 0.75 to 12 mg/l. the highest antimicrobial activities were observed against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus mutans ns, streptococcus mutans hg, streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus oralis j22 at a concentration superior to the biosurfactant critical micelle concentration. moreover, the biosurfactant showed anti-adhesive  activity against most of the microorganisms tested. as far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities of a  biosurfactant obtained from a candida strain against such a broad group of microorganisms. the results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactant from c. lipolytica is a potential antimicrobial and/or anti-adhesive agent for several biomedical applications.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == prevalence of five biofilm-related oral streptococci species from plaque.
AB  == objective: to examine the prevalence of five oral streptococci species of severe  early childhood caries (s-ecc) and caries-free (cf) groups. study design: supra gingival plaque samples were obtainedfrom 198 thai children with ages ranging from one to six years old eighty-seven subjects had no caries (dmft=0), and 111 had s-ecc. after dna extraction, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii were identified by standard pcr using species-specific primers. statistical analysis determined the differences among prevalence rates of each species using pearson chi-square test. the relationship among dmft score, age, sex and caries status within each group was analyzed by logistical regression (p  < or = 0.05). results: sex was not correlated with any of the species detected in both groups (mean age =3.09, mean +/- sd of dmft = 11.04 +/- 7.89). s. mutans was found at greatest prevalence in both groups followed by s. oralis. s. gordonii was detected at a high prevalence, but s. sobrinus and s. sanguinis were lower in s-ecc when compared with those from the cf group. conclusion: s. mutans was associated significantly with s-ecc (p < or = 0.05). caries prevalence was highest (56.5%) in subjects infected by s. mutans alone. s. sanguinis prevalence  was higher in the cf group, but not statiscally different. infection with ms did  not show higher caries prevalence.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

AB  == objective: this study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. study design: endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. during the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. the resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. the patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. results: the samples yielded  1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (porphynomonas endodontalis and prevotella oralis). mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. at the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. conclusions: the periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.

TI  == streptococcus mutans inhibits candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (sdsf).
AB  == in the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: a compound excreted by the caries bacterium streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological  transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus candida albicans. the compound excreted by s. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (ai-2), determined by the luminescence of a vibrio harveyi sensor strain. the inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of  s. mutans guided by its activity. its chemical structure was elucidated by using  nmr spectroscopy and gc-ms and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. we show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit ai-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. a potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. it is able to suppress the transition  from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. the expression of hwp1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of c. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (dsf) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a gram-positive organism (streptococcus dsf, sdsf). sdsf activity was also found in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. sdsf could be relevant in shaping multispecies candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque ph decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low ph is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. the acidification also influences plaque bacteria. severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. we, therefore, investigated the effects  of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, lactobacillus paracasei, and actinomyces naeslundii were used. effects of physiological acidification at ph 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at ph 4.0-7.0, were  investigated. results: mutans streptococci and lactobacillus grew at ph 4.0 but the growth of s. sanguinis and s. oralis ceased below ph 4.2 and ph 4.2-4.4, respectively. acidification at ph 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and actinomyces, respectively. furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of s. sanguinis, s. oralis and actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental ph had returned to 7.0. the acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and lactobacillus.  conclusions: these results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.

TI  == in vitro adherence of oral streptococci to zirconia core and veneering glass-ceramics.
AB  == plaque formation on dental ceramics may cause gingival inflammation and secondary caries. this in vitro study compared the susceptibility of various dental ceramics to adhere oral streptococci, and verified the influence of substratum surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity. three zirconia ceramic materials and three veneering glass-ceramics were investigated. fifteen test specimens were prepared for each material, polished, and surface roughness and hydrophobicity were determined. after incubation with artificial saliva (2 h, 37 degrees c) for  pellicle formation, specimens were incubated with suspensions of streptococcus gordonii dsmz 6777, streptococcus mutans dsmz 20523, streptococcus oralis dsmz 20627, or streptococcus sanguinis dsmz 20068, respectively, for 2.5 h at 37 degrees c. adherent bacteria were quantified using a fluorescence dye for viable  cell quantification (alamar blue/resazurin). statistical analysis was performed using one- and two-way anova and the tukey-kramer multiple comparison test for post hoc analysis (alpha < 0.05). surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity differed significantly among the various ceramics; protein coating hydrophilized  the surfaces, and led to a homogenization of the surface hydrophobicity of the various ceramics. before protein coating, almost similar relative fluorescence intensities indicating similar adhesion of streptococci were found for the various ceramics; more distinct differences were observed after protein coating.  correlations between surface parameters and streptococcal adhesion were poor. within the limitations of these experiments, the findings of this in vitro study  indicate only little differences between zirconia and glass ceramic with regard to streptococcal adhesion. judging from these results, it is unlikely that exposed zirconia surfaces yield more plaque than glass ceramic surfaces in vivo.

TI  == surface characterization of dental ceramics and initial streptococcal adhesion in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the surface properties of dental ceramic materials belonging to different ceramic classes, and to correlate the findings to the initial adherence of three oral streptococcal strains. methods: rectangular specimens were prepared from different ceramic materials (glass/lithium disilicate glass/glass-infiltrated zirconia/partially sintered zirconia/hipped zirconia ceramic) and polished; surface roughness (ra) was determined. glass plates were used as a control. specimens were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or an artificial saliva (protein mixture; 2h, 37 degrees c). surface free energy (gamma(t)) and its polar (gamma(p)) and disperse (gamma(d)) contribution were determined prior to and after artificial saliva exposure. uncoated and protein-coated specimens were incubated with streptococcus gordonii dsmz 6777, streptococcus oralis dsmz 20068  or streptococcus sanguinis dsmz 20068 suspension for 2.5h at 37 degrees c (n=15 for each treatment and strain). adherent streptococci were quantified fluorometrically. results: the lithium disilicate glass ceramic showed the highest values for ra; the lowest values were found for the glass ceramic, the partially sintered zirconia and the hipped zirconia ceramic. protein coating caused a significant increase in gamma(t) and gamma(p), but not in the control material. the control material showed higher values for streptococcal adhesion than all ceramic materials. after protein coating, only slight and random differences in streptococcal adhesion were found between the various ceramic materials. significance: dental ceramic materials show differences in terms of ra, gamma(t) and initial streptococcal adhesion; however, correlations between surface properties and streptococcal adhesion were poor.

TI  == bacterial profiles of oral streptococcal and periodontal bacterial species in saliva specimens from japanese subjects.
AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == phylogenetic analyses and detection of viridans streptococci based on sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the rod shape-determining protein  gene.
AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to compare the susceptibility of one novel silorane-based and four widely used conventional methacrylate-based resin composites to adhere oral streptococci and to relate any differences to surface roughness, hydrophobicity and type of matrix. methods: specimens of restoratives  filtek silorane, filtek z250, tetric evoceram, quixfil and spectrum tph were prepared (10.0-mm diameter, 2.0-mm height). surface roughness was assessed by perthometer measurements and hydrophobicity according to water contact angles was determined by computerized image analysis. bacterial suspensions of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans  were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 degrees c with 15 test specimens for each material and adhesion was quantified with fluorescence dye alamar blue/resazurin and an automated multi-detection reader. glass served as reference. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test (alpha=0.05). results: median roughness values of all composites ranged between 0.04 and 0.11 microm, median contact angles between 59.7 degrees and 92.1 degrees. significantly lowest fluorescence intensities of all test materials were found on filtek silorane for  three of four streptococcal strains. the fluorescence intensities of the four conventional methacrylate resin composites were significantly higher and comparable among each other. significance: when compared against four conventional methacrylate composite resins, a general significance to a lower quantity of adhering streptococci was found on the novel silorane-based composite resin, which might result from its increased hydrophobicity. the low adhesion potential of the silorane-based composite may potentially improve the longevity of direct fillings and reduce recurrent caries.

TI  == antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  == objective: yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. it is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. the present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. design: the sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains.  each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. two strains of each of the following streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. one millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees c, 60min) with 9ml of fat-free plain yoghurt containing streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. results: survival rates were 8% (s. mutans 6519t), 12% (s. mutans 31738), 35% (s. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (s. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. overall, s. parasanguinis and s. sobrinus were the most resistant species. when heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. conclusion: in vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on s. mutans but not on s. sobrinus.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == adhesion of oral streptococci to all-ceramics dental restorative materials in vitro.
AB  == in recent years, patients have benefited from the development of better and more  esthetic materials, including all-ceramics dental restorative materials. dental plaque formation on teeth and restorative materials plays an important role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases. this study investigates initial adhesion of stationary phase streptococcal species to different all-ceramics dental restorative materials. the saliva-coated materials were incubated with the bacteria for 1 h in an in vitro flow chamber which mimics environmental conditions in the oral cavity. number and vitality of adhering bacteria were determined microscopically after staining. surface roughness and the composition  of the materials had no distinctive influence on bacterial adhesion. however, s.  mutans and s. sobrinus adhered about tenfold less numerous to all materials than  the other streptococcal species. further, there was a correlation between bacterial vitality and materials' glass content. the results showed that early plaque formation was influenced predominantly by the presence of the salivary pellicle rather than by material dependent parameters whereas the composition of  the all-ceramics appeared to have influenced the percentage of viable cells during the adhesion process. this presented in vitro technique may provide a useful model to study the influence of different parameters on adherence of oral  streptococcal species.

AB  == objectives: viridans group streptococci (vgs) cause severe diseases such as infective endocarditis and septicaemia. genetically, vgs species are very close to each other and it is difficult to identify them to species level with conventional methods. the aims of the present study were to use sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) to identify vgs species in clinical blood culture  isolates, and to compare the results with the api 20 strep system that is based on phenotypical characteristics. methods: strains from patients with septicaemia  or endocarditis were analysed with pcr amplification and sequence analysis of the rnpb gene. clinical data were registered as well. results: one hundred and thirty two vgs clinical blood culture isolates from patients with septicaemia (n=95) or  infective endocarditis (n=36) were analysed; all but one were identified by rnpb. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii strains  were most common in the patients with infective endocarditis. in the isolates from patients with haematological diseases, streptococcus mitis and s. oralis dominated. in addition in 76 of the isolates it was possible to compare the results from rnpb analysis and the api 20 strep system. in 39/76 (51%) of the isolates the results were concordant to species level; in 55 isolates there were  no results from api 20 strep. conclusion: sequence analysis of the rnase p rna gene (rnpb) showed that almost all isolates could be identified. this could be of importance for evaluation of the portal of entry in patients with septicaemia or  infective endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (rt group) and in 13 matched controls. material and methods: the microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. a clinical examination was also performed. results: candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the rt subjects and in 15% of the controls. in three rt subjects, c. albicans  was found at all four sites analysed. an unexpected finding was that enterococci  were found in all rt subjects and in high number in 38%. none of the controls harboured enterococci. in supragingival plaque, lactobacillus spp. were detected  in 92% of the rt subjects and the number and proportion of lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the rt subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. conclusion: the microbial results explain why some rt subjects have an increased  susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis  is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for rt  subjects.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == demonstration of in vivo transfer of doxycycline resistance mediated by a novel transposon.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of bacterial doxycycline resistance between oral bacteria in subjects receiving systemic doxycycline for the treatment of periodontitis. patients and methods: streptococci were cultured before and after treatment from the subgingival plaque of two patients with periodontitis, genotyped and investigated for the presence of antimicrobial resistance determinants and conjugative transposons. results: in one subject, a strain of streptococcus sanguinis resistant to doxycycline was a minor component of the pre-treatment streptococcal flora but dominated post-treatment. in a second subject, a strain of streptococcus cristatus, which was sensitive to doxycycline before treatment, was found to have acquired a novel conjugative transposon during treatment, rendering it resistant to doxycycline and erythromycin. the novel transposon, named ctn6002, was sequenced and found to be a complex element derived in part from tn916, and an unknown element which included the erythromycin resistance gene erm(b). a strain of streptococcus oralis isolated from this subject pre-treatment was found to harbour ctn6002 and  was therefore implicated as the donor. conclusions: this is the first direct demonstration of transfer of antimicrobial resistance carried on a conjugative transposon between oral bacteria during systemic antimicrobial treatment of periodontitis in humans.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial adherence to saliva-coated through plant lectins.
AB  == in the present study, we evaluated the ability of lectin from talisia esculenta (tel) and a protein from labramia bojeri seeds (labramin) to inhibit adherence of microorganisms and exert antimicrobial effects. the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of these proteins were determined using 5 species of  bacteria: streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sobrinus 6715, streptococcus  sanguinis atcc10556, streptococcus mitis atcc903 and streptococcus oralis pb182.  in addition, an adherence assay was performed using these 5 bacterial species and sterile polystyrene microtiter plates coated with human saliva. filtered protein  solutions (6.25 to 100 mug/ml) were added to saliva-coated plates, and the plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees c. after incubation, the plates were washed, and a bacterial suspension (10(6 )cfu/ml) was then transferred to each plate, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 1 h (10% co(2)). adherence of bacteria to the acquired pellicle was visualized by staining with crystal violet, and absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 575 nm. neither labramin nor  tel, at any of the concentrations used, inhibited growth of any of the microorganisms. however, labramin inhibited adherence of s. mutans and s. sobrinus. the present results indicate that labramin is potentially useful as a biofilm-inhibiting drug.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.

TI  == the microbiological profiles of saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque and  dental caries in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == introduction: the relationships between suspected bacteria in saliva, yeasts in oral rinse, and supragingival and subgingival plaque versus root surface and coronal caries in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-diabetic group were explored. methods: one-hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited; their periodontal status, plaque index  and magnitude of root surface and coronal caries were assessed. saliva and an oral rinse were cultured for mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts. toothbrush samples of supragingival plaque and curette samples of subgingival plaque were assessed for 17 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: type 2 diabetes patients had significantly more severe periodontitis, a higher plaque index and a higher prevalence and magnitude of root surface caries than non-diabetic subjects. significantly more diabetic subjects had higher levels of treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus intermedius in their supragingival plaque than non-diabetic subjects. no significant difference  was found for the organisms in saliva, oral rinse and subgingival plaque between  the two groups. after adjustment for diabetic status, root surface caries was associated with an increased count of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva and of streptococcus mutans in supragingival plaque samples. coronal caries was only associated with lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva. conclusion: the number of cariogenic organisms in saliva and oral rinse estimated by culture demonstrated a stronger association with both root surface and coronal caries compared to those 17 species assessed with the checkerboard method in supragingival and subgingival plaque.

TI  == oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == the role of platelets in infective endocarditis.
AB  == there is growing evidence that platelets play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis (ie). this review focuses on interactions between bacteria and platelets. many types of microorganism are capable of causing endocarditis. the oral streptococci, particularly streptococcus sanguis and s. oralis, remain the most common causative bacteria in ie but staphylococcus aureus is becoming an increasingly important agent. several species of bacteria and fungi are able to cause platelet aggregation in vitro, and there are indications that this ability is associated with the production of severe disease. different bacteria appear to utilise different mechanisms of aggregation, and mechanisms for adhesion may be distinct from those responsible for aggregation. at least one commonly studied strain of s. sanguis apparently utilises the host's igg and complement responses to induce platelet activation. ie may therefore be among the number of diseases in which immunological activation of platelets is thought to be of importance. other bacterial strains have their own adhesins and agonists. the more virulent bacteria, notably the staphylococci, also possess proteolytic enzymes and may directly activate coagulation pathways, whereas less virulent, opportunistic pathogens, such as some streptococci and candida albicans, may rely on interactions with host factors for colonisation and proliferation. it is proposed that platelets are involved in formation of the non-bacterial thrombotic vegetation (nbtv) and are necessary for the effective adhesion of bacteria to the nbtv, and that platelets  also influence the persistence and clinical outcome of the disease through proliferation of the thrombotic vegetation. it is hypothesised that successful colonisation of the heart valves by a micro-organism depends on effective adhesion of the bacteria or fungi to platelets, in combination with the ability to induce platelet activation and aggregation.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of nonenterococcal streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims: most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. the emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. this study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis.  methods: a retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital.  results: between august 1996 and december 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin were included in this study. a total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. the most common species groups identified were streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. there were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with  streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. infection with streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated  with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. conclusions: high-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.

TI  == interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating oral bacterial pairs.
AB  == the temporo-spatial development of plaque is governed by adhesive interactions between different co-aggregating bacterial strains and species. physico-chemically, these interactions are due to attractive lifshitz-van der waals and acid-base forces, and occur despite electrostatic repulsion and with a  critical influence of temperature. the forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs have never been measured, however. the aim here, thus, is to investigate, by atomic force microscopy, whether there is a difference in interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating bacterial pairs  at 10 degrees c, 22 degrees c, and 40 degrees c. actinomyces naeslundii 147 was immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated tipless afm cantilevers, while streptococci were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated glass surfaces. upon approach, a repulsive force was measured, regardless of whether a co-aggregating or non-co-aggregating pair was involved. however, upon retraction, the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than did the non-co-aggregating pair. adhesive interactions between the co-aggregating pair were smallest at 40 degrees c.

AB  == objectives: to reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. materials and methods: twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. periodontal measurements included plaque index (pli), probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop). inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (cej) to the marginal bone crest (mbc) were measured on bitewing radiographs. in 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization. results: differences between the two examined groups were found related to "twin births" (p=0.0064) and "smokers" (p=0.03). none of the periodontal measurements showed any association. significant differences were found concerning presence of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. conclusion: a relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.

TI  == interleukin 1alpha increases the susceptibility of rabbits to experimental viridans streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == major predisposing conditions for infective endocarditis (ie) are the presence of a cardiac platelet-fibrin vegetation and of circulating bacteria with relatively  low susceptibility to microbicidal activity of blood platelets. the influence of  proinflammatory conditions on development of ie is unknown. we studied the effects of the presence of a catheter, inserted to induce platelet-fibrin vegetations, and of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1alpha in rabbit experimental ie. leaving the catheter in place after challenge with viridans streptococci predisposed for experimental ie. ie susceptibility rapidly decreased between 0 to 6 h after catheter removal. the catheter did not predispose for ie by providing a site for bacterial adherence, as almost all explanted catheters were culture negative. to mimic the proinflammatory influence of the catheter, rabbits were injected with interleukin-1alpha at 24 h after catheter removal and  at 0, 1, and 3 h before bacterial challenge. interleukin-1alpha injected 3 h prior to challenge significantly increased ie incidence due to a platelet releasate-susceptible streptococcus oralis strain, with rapidly increasing numbers of bacteria within the vegetations. ie due to the streptococcus sanguis strain less susceptible to platelet releasate was not enhanced. we conclude that  proinflammatory stimuli, either a catheter or interleukin-1alpha, enhanced susceptibility to ie due to the platelet releasate-susceptible s. oralis. as with rabbits, temporary intravascular proinflammatory conditions may predispose for ie in humans at risk for this serious infection.

AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. a collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant streptococcus species, were examined. identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpob, and soda; by pcr analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, rapid id 32 strep and streptogram and the associated databases.  a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. this was particularly evident in s. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. the rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. the most significant problems were observed with s. mitis and s. oralis  and 11 streptococcus species described since 1991. our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. as a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on soda sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. an analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of s. oralis and s. anginosus with various underlying infections.

TI  == microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == microcalorimetric study on the influence of temperature on bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == binding isotherms and heats of interaction have been determined at 15, 25, and 40 degrees c for a coaggregating and a non-coaggregating oral bacterial pair. heats  of interaction were measured upon three consecutive injections of streptococci into an actinomyces suspension using isothermal titration calorimetry. after each injection, the number of streptococci injected remaining free in suspension was quantified microscopically and the degree of binding between the two bacterial strains was established. the coaggregating pair shows positive cooperative binding. the highest cooperativity, at 25 degrees c, correlates with a strong, macroscopically visible coaggregation. the non-coaggregating pair shows low cooperativity and lacks macroscopically visible coaggregation. interactions between the coaggregating partners seem to be mainly due to specific, enthalpically saturable and favorable binding sites. even though the enthalpic part of the interaction is saturated, cooperativity increases with consecutive injections, implying that the coaggregation phenomenon is driven by entropy gain. the change in heat capacity (deltac(p)) is positive for the non-coaggregating pair from 15-40 degrees c as well as for the coaggregating pair beyond 25 degrees c. at lower temperatures the coaggregating pair causes a negative deltac(p). the  decrease in heat capacity together with an increase in entropy is considered to be indicative of hydrophobic interactions playing an important role in the formation of large coaggregates as observed for the coaggregating pair at 25 degrees c.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == path-dependency of the interaction between coaggregating and between non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a thermodynamic approach.
AB  == coaggregation, i.e. specific recognition between bacteria from different species, is a well-described phenomenon in the human oral cavity but remains physically poorly understood. with our study we aimed at elucidating some aspects of the mechanism of the coaggregation between the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis j22 and actinomyces naeslundii 147, in particular with respect to the driving force for coaggregation and its pathway-dependency. to that end, the macroscopic turbidity of the bacterial suspension, the morphology of the coaggregates, binding isotherms and heats of interaction were compared between the above-mentioned coaggregating bacterial pair and a non-coaggregating pair, streptococcus sanguis pk1889 and a. naeslundii 147. the coaggregating pair forms  large aggregates, which rapidly sediment from the suspension while the non-coaggregating pair forms only very small coaggregates that remain homogeneously suspended. coaggregation is further characterized by a high affinity between the partner cells that bind to each other in a strong cooperative mode. the interactions between both pairs occur under the release of  heat and are thus enthalpically favorable. more heat is released for the coaggregating than for the non-coaggregating pair. adding the coaggregating bacteria in steps to each other leads to saturation of enthalpically favorable binding sites. this is observed when the streptococcus is added to the actinomyces as well as when the addition is done the other way around. it is concluded that the cooperativity of the coaggregation process is based on an increase of entropy. it is furthermore shown that the density of the coaggregates as well as the heat effect of formation of these coaggregates depend on the number of steps in which the partner cells are added to each other. adding s. oralis j22 in three steps to a. naeslundii 147 results in the formation of denser coaggregates under the release of less heat, as compared to that of addition in one step. these differences point to a larger entropy increase when in a step-wise mixing the coaggregating bacteria are allowed to form more densely-packed coaggregates.

TI  == effect of hydrophobicity on in vitro streptococcal adhesion to dental alloys.
AB  == non-specific interactions such as electrostatic interactions, and surface free energy are of importance in bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces as they determine whether or not bacteria are attracted to the surface. the relationship  between adherence of streptococcus mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis and s. sanguinis on precious and non-precious dental alloys, and the bacterial and alloy surface hydrophobicities (a measure of the surface free energy) was studied. the number of adhering bacteria was determined by fluorescence microscopy counts. the hydrophobicity of the bacteria and alloy surfaces were evaluated by adhesion to hexadecane and water contact angles, respectively. our results showed that (i) the surfaces of the tested alloys were hydrophobic, (ii) s. sanguinis, s. mutans  and s. oralis were hydrophobic, and (iii) s. mitis was hydrophilic. s. oralis, the more hydrophobic strain, demonstrated the highest adherence on the tested materials, whereas s. mitis adhered least on the hydrophobic surfaces. for the tested alloys, bacterial adherence was highest for the high gold content alloy, and lowest for the non-precious alloy. our results showed that for the tested bacterial strains, there was a significant correlation between bacterial adhesion and substratum hydrophobicity: hydrophobic metal surfaces favor adhesion of hydrophobic bacteria.

TI  == changing incidence of detected streptococcal bacteraemia in north yorkshire, england.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == pcr detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

TI  == influence of weight on removal of co-adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compared removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240  g. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through  the chamber at 33 degrees c. on average, 34-39% of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. for co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10% of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. brushing by hand removed 82% at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93%) or sonic (92%) brushing, while for all  modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95-99%. for a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2-16% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode of brushing. for the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34-57%  of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left  22-35% of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. de novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush in contrast to the manual brush. since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

AB  == coadhesion between oral microbial pairs is an established factor in the spatiotemporal development and prevalence of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque in vivo. this study compares removal and de novo adhesion of pairs  of coadhering and non-coadhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by sonic brushing on salivary pellicles in a non-contact mode as a function of the distance between the brush and the pellicle surface in vitro. first, actinomycetes were adhered to a pellicle surface, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were allowed to adhere. removal was examined by non-contact,  sonic brushing with a wetted brush on a either a wetted or a substratum immersed  to a depth of 7 mm. after brushing, de novo adhesion of streptococci to brushed pellicles was studied. for coadhering and non-coadhering pairs, 34% and 9%, respectively, of the adhering bacteria were involved in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. non-contact, sonic brushing removed up to 99% of the adhering bacteria, regardless of the state of immersion of the substratum. bacterial removal decreased with increasing distance of up to 6 mm between brush  and pellicle surface. for the non-coadhering pair, subsequent exposure of pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded about 6% of bacteria involved in  large aggregates. alternatively, de novo adhesion of the coadhering streptococcal strain to pellicles brushed on the wetted substratum yielded 31% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, but after brushing the immersed substratum only 12% of the adhering bacteria were found in large aggregates. it is concluded that non-contact sonic brushing, under immersion, removes high percentage of adhering  bacterial pairs up to a distance of 6 mm between the brush and the pellicle surface. however, non-contact, sonic brushing with only a thin wet film on the substratum may leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == enthalpy of interaction between coaggregating and non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a microcalorimetric study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion and coaggregation are involved in the development of oral biofilms, called dental plaque. although various techniques have already been used to study different aspects of these bacterial interactions, microcalorimetry has not yet been applied. this paper describes how isothermal reaction calorimetry can be employed to determine the enthalpy of coaggregation between two oral bacterial pairs. for most biological processes, the enthalpy tends to reach a minimum value, reflecting the most stable state, which is directly related to the heat content of the system. the calorimeter consists of four measuring units where reaction ampoules are filled with 1.5 ml of an actinomyces  naeslundii 147 suspension, while reference ampoules are filled with buffer only.  after equilibration at 25 degrees c, 80 microl of a streptococcal suspension was  titrated into the reaction ampoules. to study possible saturation of the binding  sites on the actinomyces surface, three consecutive injections with streptococcal suspensions were done. following each injection, a 20-microl aliquot was taken from the ampoule kept outside the calorimeter and the number of free (s(f)) and bound (s(b)) streptococci was determined microscopically. experiments were carried out with a coaggregating streptococcal strain (streptococcus oralis j22)  and a non-coaggregating strain (streptococcus sanguis pk1889), serving as a control. the coaggregation enthalpy was exothermic, that is, heat was released in the reaction ampoule upon coaggregation and the heat released by the coaggregating pair minus the heat released by the non-coaggregating pair yielded  a coaggregation enthalpy of -0.015 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus for the first  injection. upon consecutive injections, the coaggregation enthalpy decreased to -0.0004 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus. comparison with enthalpy changes reported for lectin-carbohydrate binding suggests that a huge number of binding sites are involved in the formation of one bacterial coaggregate.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

TI  == glucan-binding proteins of the oral streptococci.
AB  == the synthesis of extracellular glucan is an integral component of the sucrose-dependent colonization of tooth surfaces by species of the mutans streptococci. in investigators' attempts to understand the mechanisms of plaque biofilm development, several glucan-binding proteins (gbps) have been discovered. some of these, the glucosyltransferases, catalyze the synthesis of glucan, whereas others, designated only as glucan-binding proteins, have affinities for different forms of glucan and contribute to aspects of the biology of their host  organisms. the functions of these latter glucan-binding proteins include dextran-dependent aggregation, dextranase inhibition, plaque cohesion, and perhaps cell wall synthesis. in some instances, their glucan-binding domains share common features, whereas in others the mechanism for glucan binding remains unknown. recent studies indicate that at least some of the glucan-binding proteins modulate virulence and some can act as protective immunogens within animal models. overall, the multiplicity of gbps and their aforementioned properties are testimonies to their importance. future studies will greatly advance the understanding of the distribution, function, and regulation of the gbps and place into perspective the facets of their contributions to the biology  of the oral streptococci.

TI  == classification of oral streptococci by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with direct activity stain for glycosyltransferases.
AB  == thirty eight strains of oral streptococci were divided into six types by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) followed by glycosyltransferase (glt)  activity stain: type 1, streptococcus mutans; type 2, streptococcus rattus; type  3, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus downei; type 4, streptococcus cricetus; type 5, streptococcus salivarius; and type 6, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii. in types 1, 2 and 5, two glucosyltransferases synthesizing water-insoluble (gtf-i) and water-soluble glucans (gtf-s) and a fructosyltransferase (ftf) were detected. in types 3 and 4, gtf-i and two gtf-ss were detected. only one gtf-s was detected in type 6. the 2-de patterns for these six types were clearly distinguished from each other based on the kind, number and location of glts in gel.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among mitis group oral streptococci.
AB  == the prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among oral streptococci was investigated by elisa and by immunoelectron microscopy using antiserum raised to  recombinant fragments of csha of streptococcus gordonii dl1. the majority of s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis strains tested elaborated short (ca. 50-80 nm long) surface fibrils and reacted with antiserum to the amino acid repeat region of csha, demonstrating the widespread nature of csh-like proteins among these species. in contrast, reactivity with antiserum raised to the adhesion-mediating non-repetitive region of csha was more restricted. on the basis of the elisa results, several isolates were selected for immunogold analysis using csha antisera. immunogold-negative staining showed a surface distribution of 10 nm gold particles consistent with antibody binding to  short fibrils. long fibrils (>150 nm long), where present, were not significantly labelled with gold. the results suggest that some of the short peritrichous fibrils on many mitis group streptococci comprise csh-like fibrillar protein. further, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that the antigenically conserved amino acid repeat region of csh-like proteins forms a scaffold for cell-distal presentation of the amino-terminal non-repetitive region that, at least in s. gordonii dl1, functions as an adhesin.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == increased proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and t cells to streptococcus mutans and glucosyltransferase d antigens in the exacerbation stage of recurrent aphthous ulcerations.
AB  == background and purpose: cytotoxic t lymphocyte-induced lysis of virus-infected oral epithelial cells has been shown to be a cause of early ulcer formation in recurrent aphthous ulcerations (rau). to test whether bacteria and their associated antigens are involved in the disease process of rau, the proliferative response (pr) to different streptococcal species in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (pbmc) and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage was determined. methods: pbmc and t cells were isolated from 39 patients with rau, 21 patients with erosive oral lichen plaus (eolp, disease control group), and 22 healthy subjects (normal control group). streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and their associated antigen, glucosyltransferase d (gtfd), were used to stimulate isolated pbmc and t cells in in vitro proliferation assays. results: pbmc and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage showed a significantly higher pr to s. mutans antigen and gtfd than those isolated from eolp patients or healthy control subjects (p < 0.05). gtfd was a more potent stimulation antigen than s. mutans. however, elevated prs to s. mutans antigen and gtfd were transient and present only in the exacerbation stage of rau. these elevated prs declined to normal levels in the postexacerbation and convalescence stages of rau. furthermore, the gtfd-stimulated pr in pbmc and t cells was correlated with  the severity of rau. conclusion: in addition to viral infections, streptococci and their associated antigen, gtfd, may be involved in the disease process of rau, especially in the exacerbation stage.

TI  == the relativity between streptococcus sanguis group and coronary heart disease.
AB  == objective: to study the relativity between streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and  coronary heart disease (chd). methods: 41 individuals were diagnosed with chd and 18 normals served as controls. all of them had undergone coronary angiography. their social class (including education and wages), smoking, drinking, blood lipids and oral health were also recorded. ssg in saliva and subgingival plaque were cultivated in nays-b agar plates and counted. ssg were identified into species with routine biochemical reaction and ap-pcr. results: in the multiple step regression analysis, the amount of ssg in saliva and subgingival plaque were positively associated with severe coronary atheromatosis after adjusting the classical risk factors of chd. the average amount of ssg in saliva was (435 +/- 422) x 10(8) cfu/l in chd group and (358 +/- 540) x 10(8) cfu/l in control group, f = 2.72, p = 0.08; the average amount of ssg in incisor was (331 +/- 484) x 10(7) cfu/l in chd group and (98 +/- 164) x 10(7) cfu/l in control group, f = 5.54, p = 0.02; the average amount of ssg in molar was (352 +/- 381) x 10(7) cfu/l in chd group and (185 +/- 232) x 10(7) cfu/l in control group, f = 2.86, p  = 0.10. s. sanguis and s. gordonii were more in chd group than in control group (p < 0.05), whereas s. mitis and s. oralis were the same in two groups (p > 0.05). conclusion: the increase of ssg in oral floras may play an important role  in the occurrence of chd.

TI  == establishment of streptococci in the upper respiratory tract: longitudinal changes in the mouth and nasopharynx up to 2 years of age.
AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == distribution of environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis serotype 2  among s. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

AB  == the purpose of this research was to estimate the prevalence and intensity of bacteraemia associated with orthodontic treatment procedures. the four procedures investigated were: an upper alginate impression, separator placement, band placement, and adjustment of an archwire on a fixed appliance. eighty-one children undergoing general anaesthesia (ga) for dento-alveolar surgery related to their orthodontic treatment were randomly allocated to the impression or separator group. a further 61 children, receiving treatment in the outpatient department, were included and randomly allocated to the banding or archwire adjustment groups. a cannula was inserted into either the left or right antecubital fossa using an aseptic technique. a baseline 6 ml sample of blood was taken before treatment and a second 6 ml sample was taken 30 seconds after the procedure. there was no significant difference in the number of positive blood cultures between baseline (nine, 23 per cent), and following an upper alginate impression (twelve, 31 per cent); between baseline (twelve, 27 per cent), and placement of a separator (fifteen, 36 per cent); between baseline (nine, 36 per cent), and fitting or placement of a band (eleven, 44 per cent); or between baseline (twelve, 33 per cent), and archwire adjustment (seven, 19.4 per cent). for the separator group only the mean total number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria combined, isolated from the blood samples (cfu of bacteria per ml of blood), was significantly greater following the placement of a separator (2.2, sd 9.1), compared with baseline (0.9, sd 0.2; p < 0.02). this investigation demonstrates that the only orthodontic treatment procedure that causes a significant bacteraemia is the placement of a separator.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == repressed respiration of oral streptococci grown in biofilms.
AB  == the respiratory activities of oral streptococci grown in biofilms were found to be markedly repressed compared with those of cells from aerobic culture, or for streptococcus mutans gs-5, even for those grown in static culture. respiration rates generally reflected levels of nadh oxidase activities in cell extracts. superoxide dismutase levels were somewhat reduced in biofilm cells. however, sensitivities to oxidative damage caused by h2o2, t-butylhydroperoxide, or 8-hydroxyquinoline were not greatly different for cells from suspension cultures  and those from either intact or dispersed biofilms. the capacities of s. sanguis  and s. gordonii to produce h2o2 also were markedly repressed by biofilm growth, and presumably this repression would affect the ecology of dental plaque by reducing oxidative stresses under crowded conditions.

TI  == adhesion in vitro of oral streptococci to porcelain, composite resin cement and human enamel.
AB  == we investigated the initial adhesion in vitro of oral streptococci to porcelain inlays. four strains of streptococci, streptococcus mitis nctc12261, streptococcus oralis atcc9811, streptococcus sanguis atcc10556 and streptococcus  sobrinus omz176, were used in this study. the disc specimens were made of porcelain, composite resin cement and human enamel. these specimens, with or without a saliva-coat, were immersed in a suspension of each streptococci strain  at 37 degrees c for 1 hr, and the numbers of cells adhering to specimens were counted after staining. the saliva-coat significantly decreased the numbers of adhering cells in all strains tested (t-test, p < 0.05). the adhesion to the porcelain and resin cements could be explained by a thermodynamic approach, although the adhesion to enamel could not be explained. these results indicated the possibility that the mechanism is different in initial adhered strains of streptococci between enamel and dental restorative materials.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == dysregulation of monocyte oxidative burst in streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == background: streptococcal subacute endocarditis is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. although structural cardiac defects are pivotal, phagocytic cells, i.e. monocytes and neutrophils, are involved in the induction and the course of bacterial endocarditis. decreased production of reactive oxygen metabolites was described in long-lasting infections. we hypothesized that the oxidative burst of phagocytes induced by the infecting organism is defective in patients with streptococcal endocarditis. patients and methods: the monocytes and neutrophils of 11 patients with streptococcal native valve endocarditis were challenged with the respective pathogens and two control streptococcal strains, and the oxidative burst was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. these experiments were done before any antibiotic therapy was administered, and repeated at least 12 months after recovery. eight volunteers served as healthy controls. results: the monocyte response to the respective pathogens was decreased in the patient groups compared to the response to the control streptococci. after cure the monocyte response to the pathogens was not different to the response to the control strains. the monocyte response of the healthy volunteers did not show any differences between the patients' pathogens and the control strains. the neutrophil oxidative burst to the pathogens was similar to that to the control streptococci in both patient and the volunteer group. conclusion: the decreased response of patient monocytes to the pathogens may contribute to the low-grade inflammatory response and to the course of streptococcal endocarditis.

TI  == co-adhesion and removal of adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by three different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compares removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by hand, electric and sonic brushing from salivary pellicles. in addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 c. pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed and the number of bacteria remaining determined. whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater  numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving streptococcus oralis j22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with streptococcus sanguis pk1889. re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. this  demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs. in contrast, in the presence of lactose only small aggregates  of co-adhering pair were left behind.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside as determined by acidogenicity of oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ.
AB  == the cariogenic potential of lactosylfructoside [o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->4)-o-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)-beta-d-fruct ofuranoside] was estimated by experiments on oral streptococci in vitro and human dental plaque in situ. lactosylfructoside was unable to support growth of the strains of streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus used in this study. however, it was able to support growth of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. oralis. acid was produced rapidly by cell suspensions of s. oralis atcc 10557 incubated with lactosylfructoside. application of 5% w/v solution decreased the ph of human dental plaque. the minimum ph value was below 5.3. the results suggest that lactosylfructoside is as acidogenic as lactose and could be cariogenic if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  == this study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans or actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of  buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. on average, s. sanguis was the  easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while a. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). the combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including ph, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).

TI  == investigation of bacteremia after orthodontic banding and debanding following chlorhexidine mouth wash application.
AB  == this study investigates the prevalence of bacteremia after orthodontic banding and debanding, following the application of a 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. the banding and debanding groups were each composed of 40 young adult  patients. in the banding group, patients were asked to rinse their mouth with chlorhexidine gluconate for 60 seconds just prior to fitting of the bands. in the debanding group, they were asked to use the mouthwash immediately before removal  of bands and brackets. in both groups pre- and post-treatment blood samples were  obtained with a strict aseptic technique. in the banding group, no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment sample and 2.5% post-treatment bacteremia was detected in the post-treatment sample. in the debanding group, 2.5% bacteremia was found in both the pre- and post-treatment samples. the prevalence of post-treatment bacteremia found in the present study were compared with the findings of 2 preliminary studies in which the prevalence of bacteremia had been  investigated after banding and debanding without a prior application of chlorhexidine mouthwash. the application of chlorhexidine mouthwash resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of bacteremia after banding and debanding, but the decrease was not statistically significant.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == binding of oral streptococci to human fibrinogen.
AB  == the interaction of oral streptococci with human fibrinogen was investigated. streptococcus gordonii was chosen as a representative species to study the binding to fibrinogen. s. gordonii dl1 adhered to immobilized fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. binding to immobilized fibrinogen was saturable, concentration and temperature dependent. the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to fibrinogen was inhibited by anti-fibrinogen antibody. heating of the bacteria for 1 h at 95 degrees c resulted in 90% inhibition of the binding. trypsin treatment  of the bacteria resulted in decreased binding. neither lipoteichoic acid nor culturing of the bacteria in a sucrose-supplemented medium had any effect on the  binding. s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis bound to the immobilized fibrinogen, but mutans streptococci did not. none of the oral streptococci tested bound to the fibrinogen in fluid phase. these results suggest that the binding of s. gordonii dl1 to immobilized fibrinogen is mediated through a specific protein adhesin-receptor interaction, and fibrinogen acts as a cryptitope.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == utilization and acid production of beta-galactosyllactose by oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  == beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid  from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-galactosyllactose supported  growth of streptococcus sanguis atcc 35105, atcc 49298, streptococcus mitis atcc  15914, streptococcus oralis atcc 35037, atcc 10557 and streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not  be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when s. oralis atcc 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. these results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

AB  == it has been shown that there is a window of infectivity for mutans streptococci between the ages of 19 and 31 months, when many children acquire mutans streptococci transmitted from their mothers. part of the children that escape this window acquire mutans streptococci at a later age. in this group, maternal transmission is expected to be less prevalent. the present study compared the bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci isolated from mothers, fathers and children when the children acquired the mutans streptococci between the ages of 5 and 11. twelve families were randomly selected from a group of 11-year-old children who were known to have acquired mutans streptococci during this age period. from the saliva of the mothers (n = 12), fathers (n = 8) and children (n = 12) approximately 30 mutans streptococci strains were isolated. all isolates were tested twice for bacteriocin activity against 21 indicator strains  with a double-layer technique. bacteriocin activity of strains was considered to  be different when the number of strains against which bacteriocin was produced differed >1 or when the width of one or more inhibition zones differed > or =4 mm. in 7/12 mother-child pairs similar profiles were found. in the 8 father-child pairs similar profiles were only found on 2 occasions. in these 2 families, all 3 ( mother, father and child) harboured strains with a similar profile. in 4/8 father-mother pairs similar profiles were found. there was no correlation between the prevalence of mutans streptococci strains, the number of indicator strains against which the strains made bacteriocin, nor the mean size of the inhibition zones and the presence of similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family members. the results show that even when a child acquires mutans streptococci after the age of 5, there may be similarity between  mutans streptococci in mother, father and child, indicating that transmission between the family members occurs.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == purification, characterization, and molecular analysis of the gene encoding glucosyltransferase from streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the oral streptococcal family and an early-colonizing microorganism in the oral cavity of humans. s. oralis is known to produce glucosyltransferase (gtase), which synthesizes glucans from sucrose. the enzyme was purified chromatographically from a culture supernatant of s. oralis atcc 10557. the purified enzyme, gtase-r, had a molecular mass of 173 kda  and a pi of 6.3. this enzyme mainly synthesized water-soluble glucans with no primer dependency. the addition of gtase markedly enhanced the sucrose-dependent  resting cell adhesion of streptococcus mutans at a level similar to that found in growing cells of s. mutans. the antibody against gtase-r inhibited the glucan-synthesizing activities of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguis, as well as s. oralis. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of gtase-r exhibited no similarities to known gtase sequences of oral streptococci. using degenerate pcr primers, an 8.1-kb dna fragment, carrying the gene (gtfr) coding for gtase-r and its regulator gene (rgg), was cloned and sequenced. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the rgg genes of s. oralis and s. gordonii exhibited a close similarity. the gtfr gene was found to possess a species-specific nucleotide sequence corresponding to the n-terminal 130 amino acid residues. insertion of erm or apha into the rgg or gtfr gene resulted in decreased gtase activity by the organism and changed the colony morphology of these transformants. these results indicate that s. oralis gtase may play an important role in the subsequent colonizing of mutans streptoccoci.

TI  == co-aggregation as a virulent factor of streptococcus sanguis isolated from infective endocarditis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of strains of the streptococcus sanguis group, isolated from infective endcarditis, was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. the pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was also examined in various viable combinations of the two bacterial species. more abscesses were formed by a. viscosus than the s. sanguis group including clinical isolates. abscess formation by co-aggregates of combinations of each isolate and  a. viscosus produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with a pure suspension of a. viscosus or tested streptococci. co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vivo. these results indicated that s. sanguis group streptococci isolated from infective endocarditis are able to co-aggregate and resist phagocytosis. the ability of co-aggregation of s. sanguis may serve as a survival mechanism in a host defense system and may be linked with virulence of this bacteria.

TI  == adhesion of candida albicans to oral streptococci is promoted by selective adsorption of salivary proteins to the streptococcal cell surface.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to saliva-coated surfaces is an important early step in the colonization of the oral cavity. c. albicans cells also adhere to several  species of oral streptococci including streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis in what are believed to be multi-modal interactions. it is now demonstrated that incubation of streptococcal cells of these species with human parotid saliva further promotes the adhesion of c. albicans cells by up to 2-3-fold. various species of streptococci were shown to adsorb different protein components of parotid saliva to their cell surfaces. the basic proline-rich proteins (bprps), to which c. albicans cells bind on nitrocellulose blot overlay, were strongly adsorbed to the surface of s. gordonii cells but not to s. oralis cells. parotid saliva that was pre-adsorbed with s. gordonii cells and then applied to hydroxylapatite beads was <50% effective at supporting adhesion of c. albicans compared with control (non-adsorbed) saliva, demonstrating that bprps are major pellicle receptors. c. albicans cells did not  adsorb bprps from fluid-phase parotid saliva. following size-exclusion chromatography of parotid saliva samples, pooled fractions enriched in bprps promoted maximal adhesion of c. albicans to s. gordonii cells. the results demonstrate that c. albicans cells recognize only surface-bound forms of bprps and suggest that these proteins adsorbed to enamel or to streptococcal surfaces promote c. albicans adhesion and oral colonization.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (ii). effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract on caries-inducing properties of mutans  streptococci.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract (ote) on the caries-inducing properties of mutans streptococci were examined in vitro. ote reduced the rate of acid production by mutans streptococci accompanied with the retardation of growth rate of mutans streptococci, while the action by chromatographically isolated oolong tea polyphenol (otf6) was weak. on the other hand, both oolong tea products decreased cell surface hydrophobicity of almost all the oral streptococci examined in the present study, and also induced cellular aggregation of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus gordonii. in these reactions, otf6 showed a more pronounced activity than ote. furthermore, the oolong tea products inhibited the adherence of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. these results suggest that otf6 may inhibit bacterial adherence to the tooth surfaces by reducing the hydrophobicity of mutans streptococci, and ote may inhibit caries-inducing activity of mutans streptococci by reducing the rate of acid production.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  == acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. the cells of non-mutans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis [streptococcus sanguinis], streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis) grown at ph 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered ph to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered ph to 3.70. when the growth ph was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum ph values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). along with  the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of h(+)-atpase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress  proteins cross-reacting with 60 kda and 70 kda heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70). these results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in  non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of h(+)-atpase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. the strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.

TI  == cumulative correlations of lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, s-iga, amylase, and total protein concentrations with adherence of oral viridans streptococci to microplates coated with human saliva.
AB  == redundancy refers to the observation that many salivary proteins exhibit similar  properties in vitro. it is possible that bacterial adherence to salivary pellicle occurs as a cumulative effect of multiple proteins. this study determined the joint and individual contributions of salivary amylase, s-iga, lysozyme, salivary peroxidase, lactoferrin, and total protein concentrations to adherence by oral viridans streptococci in microplates coated with whole saliva from 123 persons. strains used were: streptococcus gordonii blackburn, 10558, streptococcus mitis 10712, 903, streptococcus oralis 10557, 9811, and streptococcus sanguis 10556, 13379. rabbit antibody against 13379 was used for the detection of adherence. this antibody cross-reacted with all strains. absorbance was standardized against saliva pooled from five donors. all saliva samples had been previously assayed for amylase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory iga, peroxidase, and total protein. adherence scores for all strains except 13379 were significantly and positively correlated. salivas binding high or low levels of one strain tended to bind others correspondingly. multiple regression indicated significant contributions to 10558 adherence from total protein and lactoferrin (positive), and peroxidase  and lysozyme (negative). similar results were obtained for blackburn and 903. significant individual correlations were seen for 9811 and total protein (positive), 10557 and peroxidase (negative), and 13379 and lactoferrin (negative). salivas with high adherence scores contained significantly more protein and lactoferrin, and significantly less peroxidase, than salivas with low adherence scores. these findings support the hypothesis that multiple proteins contribute to the adherence of streptococcal strains in vivo.

AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == composition of pellicles formed in vivo on tooth surfaces in different parts of the dentition, and in vitro on hydroxyapatite.
AB  == saliva from the major salivary glands dominates different areas of the mouth. the parotid (ps) and submandibular/sublingual (sms) saliva differ in their protein composition, and thus, the composition of pellicles formed in various parts of the dentition might vary. in this study, proteins incorporated in 60-min pellicles from the premolar and front regions of the mouths of 4 subjects were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antibodies to amylase, albumin, iga, parotid saliva agglutinin, low molecular weight sms mucin (mg2) and proline-rich proteins. pellicles formed in vitro on hydroxyapatite using ps, sms and whole saliva from the subjects were examined in a similar manner. the pellicles formed in vitro and in vivo showed a major difference in the appearance of albumin. bands of albumin  were clearly stained in the samples of in vivo pellicles but were not observed or hardly visible in western blots from the experimental, in vitro pellicles. the sites in the dentition from which a specific protein was recovered could differ between the 4 individuals. the overall protein pattern of the pellicles showed, however, characteristics typical of the saliva which may prevail in the part of the mouth where the pellicles were formed. thus, parotid saliva agglutinin, a receptor for streptococcus mutans, was primarily found in the premolar part of the dentition. the mucin mg2, which may mediate the adherence of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis, was in no case clearly seen in pellicles from the premolar region of the upper jaw. the observed variations might be important  to the establishment of microflora and tooth-related disease patterns in various  parts of the dentition.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

TI  == whole-cell protein electrophoretic analysis of viridans streptococci: evidence for heterogeneity among streptococcus mitis biovars.
AB  == one hundred reference strains representing all species belonging to the different phylogenetic lineages of the viridans streptococci were examined by means of one-dimensional whole-organism protein electrophoresis. for most of the species examined, multiple strains characterized by dna-dna hybridization were included and, wherever described, representatives of different biochemical variants were analysed. most species were clearly differentiated. the data support the viewpoint that members of the streptococcus anginosus group constitute a single species and indicate that streptococcus mitis biovar 2 is a heterogeneous taxon comprising strains from several streptococcal species.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == a comprehensive genetic study of streptococcal immunoglobulin a1 proteases: evidence for recombination within and between species.
AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

AB  == an antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. interaction between the material (termed) oais) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. seven species of streptococcus and two actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to oais revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. the results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to oais. gel electrophoresis revealed that oais could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the strep. mutans strain to oais in a dose-dependent manner. the results indicate that oais adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. a major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

TI  == shear bond strength, microleakage and antimicrobial properties of aelitebond.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the shear bond strength (sbs) and microleakage (ml) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria  of aelitebond single primer restorative system. materials and methods: fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. the test specimens were prepared on  the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit sic paper. the bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees c for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. for the microleakage determination, class v cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees c and 15 degrees c in 2% methylene blue. the teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. the color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. the modified model cavity method of meryon & johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. results: the mean sbs values (in mpa) were  found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. there was no significant increase (p < 5%) in the sbs after 15 minutes. the ml of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the sbs values. the restorative system significantly (p < 5%) inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, streptococcus mutans with 42%, streptococcus sanguis with 39% and streptococcus oralis with 9%. however, the growth of veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.

TI  == identification and characterization of a protease from streptococcus oralis c104.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is among the earliest colonizers of the tooth surface during plaque formation. as such, its enzymatic activities may influence ecologic succession on the tooth surface. in the current study, we use zymograms and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify and purify a protease  from s. oralis (sanguis) c104. proteases from s. oralis c104 were detected in cell pellets at 133, 146 and 176 kda as clear proteolytic bands on gelatin-substrate zymograms. preparation of the major (146 kda) protease were obtained by continuous-elution electrophoresis. the protease was active over the  ph range of 7 to 9 with optimum activity between ph 8 and 9. protease activity was inhibited by several serine protease inhibitors including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, di-isopropyl-phosphofluoridate and aprotinin. the  protease showed highest hydrolytic activity against azoalbumin and bz-pro-phe-arg-na. immunofluorescence studies with a polyclonal antiserum to the  146-kda protease suggest it is present on the cell surface of s. oralis c104. zymograms of cell pellets from other s. oralis strains as well as s. sanguis and  streptococcus mitis suggest that functionally similar proteases are elaborated by many early colonizers of the tooth surface.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == identification and classification of species within the streptococcus sanguis group.
AB  == a biochemical identification scheme has been produced that allows for the differentiation of nine distinct species within the streptococcus sanguis group.  the species are s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. crista, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. defectivus, s. adjacens and s. mitis, which have been previously described, and a new species, s. australis; in addition two distinct subspecies, s. oralis subsp.  corona and s. oralis subsp. mitior, have been identified. dna-dna hybridization confirmed the separation of strains into the species. a new type of peptidoglycan peptide linkage, lys-ala-gly was also found within the species s. parasanguis and s. australis that has not been observed within the streptococci previously. dna fingerprinting was shown to be a useful method for discriminating between strains within species, but did not allow discrimination between species.

TI  == co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs under flow in the presence of saliva and lactose.
AB  == co-aggregation (interactions between two suspended micro-organisms) between oral  microbial pairs has been studied extensively and is believed to be an important factor in dental plaque formation. however, co-adhesion (interactions between suspended and already-adhering micro-organisms) may well be equally important. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of saliva and lactose on the co-adhesion of streptococci (s. oralis 34 and s. sanguis pk1889) to actinomyces (a. naeslundii t14v-j1 or 5951) adhering on glass under flow from buffer and saliva in the absence and presence of lactose. the kinetics of co-adhesion as well as co-adhesion in a stationary end-point of co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber by analysis of the spatial arrangement of co-adhering micro-organisms as a function of time.  for co-aggregating pairs, initial deposition rates of streptococci in the immediate vicinity of adhering actinomyces (local initial deposition rates) were  up to 5 to 10 times higher than the non-local initial deposition rates in buffer  and in saliva, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, 5 to 6 times more streptococci co-adhered with the adhering actinomyces than averaged over the entire substratum surface. a non-co-aggregating pair showed only minor preferential (co-)adhesion near the adhering actinomyces. co-adhesion in buffer was fully lost when lactose was added. however, addition of lactose to saliva did not inhibit co-adhesion, but co-adhesion became more reversible. detachment of micro-organisms from the substratum due to the passage of an air-liquid interface, as occurs in the oral cavity during eating, drinking, and speaking, was minimal when deposition was carried out from buffer to bare glass. major detachment of streptococci adhering to the substratum occurred when adhesion was  mediated through a salivary conditioning film on the glass, while detachment of adhering actinomyces and streptococci co-adhering with them remained low. it is suggested that, in the development of dental plaque, adhering actinomyces may act as strongholds for other micro-organisms, like streptococci, to adhere.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of mutans streptococci.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata strongly inhibited the absorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha), but enhanced that of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 and  streptococcus oralis atcc 10557. furthermore, funoran had a strong desorption activity against mutans streptococci preadsorbed to s-ha. in the presence of sucrose, the absorption of cells of streptococcus sobrinus b13, streptococcus mutans ingbritt, and s. mutans mt8148r to s-ha was strongly inhibited by 0.01% funoran. the colonization of s. sobrinus 6715 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats that were administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores  of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == streptococcus oralis previously identified as uncommon 'streptococcus sanguis' in behcet's disease.
AB  == the relation between the biochemical and serological properties of 'streptococcus sanguis' was studied to characterize the strains isolated from dental plaque of patients with behcet's disease and controls. seven reference and 100 clinical strains preserved by the behcet's disease research committee of japan were identified using established criteria and differentiated with antisera against strep. oralis atcc 10557, strep. sanguis atcc 10556 and 'strep. sanguis' st7, compatible with the criteria. uncommon serovars (serotypes) kth-1 (= atcc 49298), kth-2 (= atcc 49296), kth-3 (= atcc kth-4 (= atcc 49297) and b220 (serovar kth-1) with both iga1 protease and neuraminidase (sialidase) were identified as strep. oralis, whereas common serovars st3 with iga1 protease alone and st7 without both enzymes were identified as strep. sanguis and strep. gordonii, respectively. isolates previously ranked as uncommon serovars were identified as strep. oralis, whereas the rest ranked as common serovars were identified as the same species as those of the grouping strains. a soft-agar technique was available for species identification except for strep. oralis serovar kth-1 reacting with the antiserum against strep. gordonii st7. the frequency of isolation of strep. oralis was higher in behcet's disease (52%) than in controls (38%), but no difference was observed between the properties of the two groups of isolates. strep. oralis virulence factors may be involved in breach the mucosal barrier in patients with  specific reactivity to these antigens and inducing behcet's disease.

AB  == over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to beighton and  co-workers. streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. both species were associated with oromucositis. isolates presently identified as s. oralis are mainly those previously identified as s. mitis or streptococcus sanguis ii. streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), streptococcus constellatus  (n = 4), and streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). in 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. from this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. the rapid id 32 strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of beighton et al., whereas the api 20 strep system did not.

TI  == sucrose-dependent accumulation of oral streptococci and their adhesion-defective  mutants on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the adhesion and accumulation of oral streptococci on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was examined in strains representing species that appear in initial plaque (streptococcus sanguise fc1 and streptococcus oralis c5) and in more mature plaque (streptococcus gordonii g9b). washed cells of strains fc1 and  c5 did not attach better to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than did strain g9b, suggesting that the degree of initial adhesiveness does not alone account for the temporal appearance of these bacteria in dental plaque. growing cells of each strain were also examined for their ability to accumulate on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the addition of sucrose to the medium promoted the accumulation of strain g9b more than it promoted the accumulation of strains fc1 and c5. sucrose also enhanced the accumulation of adhesion-defective mutants of each strain to levels similar to those of the respective parent strains. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent accumulation may facilitate the colonization of the tooth surface by these species of oral streptococci when adhesion is limited  by reduced bacterial adhesiveness or limited pellicle-binding sites.

TI  == saliva protein binding to layers of oral streptococci in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == this paper reports a system for measuring saliva protein binding to oral streptococci. enamel chips with layers of streptococcus gordonii blackburn or streptococcus oralis 10557 were incubated in vitro with whole saliva from eight persons. blackburn bound significantly more amylase than 10557; no strain differences were seen for lysozyme or lactoferrin. there were significant correlations between saliva and bound amylase and lactoferrin. blackburn and 10557 chips were then placed in ten subjects. sites included the buccal left and  right upper premolars and molars (ul, ur), labial upper central incisors (uc), and lingual lower central incisors (ll). that study was repeated three months later; chips with streptococcus sanguis 13379 were also placed then. blackburn bound significantly more amylase than the other strains. blackburn and 10557 both bound the most amylase at ul and ur, and the least amylase at uc. however, strain 13379 bound less amylase at ul. that strain also bound significantly less siga at ul. all three strains bound the least siga at uc. lysozyme and lactoferrin binding showed few differences among sites or strains. bound protein concentrations were significantly correlated across sites and strains within subjects, but not correlated with whole saliva. strain differences may reflect species differences in amylase binding, or differences in species-specific siga titers. site differences may indicate local variation in protein availability. differences between chip correlations with whole saliva in vitro and in vivo suggest that the salivary film may be modified as it flows over tooth surfaces.

AB  == the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was evaluated for its ability to identify 21 species of viridans group streptococci; results were compared with dna-dna hybridization results and results of conventional physiological tests. a total of 171 strains of the 21 species including 147 clinical strains was analyzed. of the 156 strains of species included in the database of this system, 136 strains (87%) were correctly identified. incorrect identification occurred for 13 strains (8%), and no identification was given for  7 strains (5%). it was difficult to differentiate s. mitis and s. oralis accurately with this system. of the 17 strains identified as s. mitis by the rapid id 32 strep system, the results of dna-dna hybridization were in agreement  for only 3 strains. s. crista and s. parasanguis, which are not included in the database, were identified as s. mitis or s. sanguis or were not identified, but s. parasanguis could probably be identified by using the rapid id 32 strep system because the biochemical profile is well characterized for this species. the rapid id 32 strep system can be used to differentiate most species for which phenotypic characteristics have been described if the database is revised according to recently reported amended criteria for the identification of viridans group streptococci. however, identification of a few species such as s. mitis and s. oralis is problematic with this system.

AB  == members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and streptococcus milleri group  (smg) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. the most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with streptococcus intermedius (smg) being the only species capable of producing the activity. for arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture  supernatant fluids whereas n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. no arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (bsa) and casein. casein was  degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade bsa. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus (smg), streptococcus mitior and streptococcus defectivus (ssg) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. the groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase.  strep. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. no species within the smg was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene  tet(m). both pcr amplification and dna hybridization, using a fragment of tet(m)  from tn1545, were used to detect tet(m). the pcr primers (5'-gacacgccaggacatatgg-3' and 5'-tgctttcctcttgttcgag-3') were chosen to amplify  a 397 bp region of tet(m). tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. the percentage of tet(m)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83%  (mean of 10%). tet(m) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. the tet(m) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly s. intermedius, s. oralis, s. sanguis, and streptococcus sm4), actinomyces d01 (14%), bifidobacterium d05 (11%), and veillonella spp. (10%). tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(m) was not detected included the prevotella and bacteroides species (41%, mainly bacteroides d28, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. oris). these results suggest that tet(m) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of s. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not  considered to be periodontopathogens. assessment of other tetracycline-resistant  genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.

AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == isolation and structural characterization of adhesin polysaccharide receptors.
AB  == the procedure for the purification of the adhesin polysaccharide receptor and its hexasaccharide repeating unit from whole s. oralis atcc 55229 by chemical, enzymatic, and chromatographic techniques has been described. chemical, chromatographic, and mass spectrometric procedures allow preliminary structural characterization of the hexasaccharide repeating unit and polysaccharide. the structural characterizations of the hexasaccharide and polysaccharide are completed using several 1d and 2d nmr techniques. identification of the anomeric  1h and 13c signals of the glycosyl residues permits, by virtue of their chemical  shifts and coupling constants (3jhh and 1jch), the determination of the configurations of the glycosidic linkages. the hmbc connectivities permit the establishment of the hexasaccharide sequence as rhap alpha(1-->2)rhap alpha(1-->3)galp alpha(1-->3)galp beta(1-->4)glcp beta(1-->3)gal. the 1h nmr chemical shifts of the polysaccharide, as determined by the combination of cosy and tocsy experiments, and the observed interglycosidic noesy cross-peaks reveal  the structure of the polysaccharide to be [formula: see text] where the position  of the glycerol (gro) phosphate moiety has been determined by [1h, 31p] nmr spectroscopy.

TI  == kinetics of lactose-reversible coadhesion of actinomyces naeslundii wvu 398a and  streptococcus oralis 34 on the surface of hexadecane droplets.
AB  == most investigations of mechanisms accounting for intergeneric coaggregation have  emphasized stereospecific rather than nonspecific interactions. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of lectin-carbohydrate and nonspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, using a model based on strains with one of the most well understood specific coaggregation mechanisms, the lactose-reversible coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. the kinetics of coadhesion and desorption of coadherent bacteria were studied using s. oralis 34 bound to hexadecane droplets  as an affinity support for the adhesion of a. naeslundii wvu 398a. light, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a. naeslundii cells adhered only to the s. oralis cells, not to exposed hexadecane between the streptococci. coadhesion was inhibited by lactose concentrations as low as 2.0 mm. the rate of coadhesion was halved at 60 mm lactose. the hydrophobicity inhibitors bovine serum albumin and defatted bovine serum albumin  and the salts licl and kcl failed to inhibit coadhesion in the hexadecane assay,  and bovine serum albumin also failed to inhibit coaggregation in a bacterial aggregation assay on glass slides. high concentrations of the salts achieved a 50% rate decrease in a. naeslundii adhesion to the s. oralis-coated droplets only when they were combined with > 20 mm lactose. sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) and tween 20 inhibition was tested by the slide coaggregation assay because they tended to emulsify the droplets; sds was inhibitory. lactose selectively desorbed a. naeslundii from s. oralis-coated droplets at low concentrations equivalent to  those that inhibited coadhesion. neither licl nor kcl desorbed a. naeslundii from the droplets, even at 500 mm. at low concentrations, sds but not tween 20 eluted  both a. naeslundii and s. oralis from the droplets. although the sds results might suggest a degree of cooperative charge interactions, the results support the hypothesis that stereospecific, beta-galactoside-sensitive interactions have  a much greater impact than nonspecific interactions on the coadhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis.

TI  == effect of binding of fibrinogen to each bacterium on coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis. in this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and p. gingivalis. however, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of s. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. labelled materials were recovered from the extract of p. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of nem but not in the absence of nem. in the binding experiment, p. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than s. oralis. these findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with s. oralis on the p. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.

TI  == action of sodium fluoride on phagocytosis by systemic polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  == alterations in phagocytosis appear to be important in the onset and development of periodontitis. we investigated new substances that may be of use in the treatment of periodontitis. in a preliminary study, we tested the effect of sodium fluoride on phagocytosis by circulating polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns) in 10 replicate assays using blood from six healthy subjects. sodium fluoride was tested at concentrations of 1.0 micron to 4.0 microns against streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguis. the phagocytic index against all microorganisms increased  significantly at all concentrations of sodium fluoride assayed; this effect was dose dependent. sodium fluoride appeared to stimulate phagocytosis via two mechanisms: an apparent increase in bacterial susceptibility to phagocytosis, and direct stimulation of phagocytosis by pmns.

TI  == antigenic relationships among immunoglobulin a1 proteases from haemophilus, neisseria, and streptococcus species.
AB  == to investigate the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive  collection of serine type and metallo-type iga1 proteases and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type iga1 proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis and of serine type iga1 proteases from haemophilus and pathogenic neisseria species was extremely limited. a number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type iga1 proteases released by members of the genera haemophilus and neisseria,  reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. however, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of iga1 proteases from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. in contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae iga1 proteases, making them potentially attractive vaccine components. among metallo-type iga1 proteases, several pneumococcal proteases were found to induce neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of oral streptococci whereas the opposite was not the case.

TI  == pioneer oral streptococci produce immunoglobulin a1 protease.
AB  == as part of a longitudinal study of the relationship between bacterial colonization and the secretory immune response, 367 isolates of pioneer viridans  streptococci collected from 40 breast- and bottle-fed neonates within the first month postpartum were tested for the production of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease and glycosidases. fifty percent of the streptococci isolated produced iga1 protease, including all isolates of streptococcus oralis and s. sanguis, 60.7% of s. mitis biovar 1 isolates, and some isolates that could not be identified. three cleavage patterns of alpha 1 heavy chains were observed. six isolates of s. mitis biovar 1 that did not produce iga1 protease attacked the alpha 1 chain. incubation of iga1 protease-negative s. mitis biovar 1 isolates with iga1, either prior to or together with s. sanguis, rendered the iga1 paraprotein resistant to cleavage by the iga1 protease of s. sanguis. the ability of some pioneer streptococci in the human oral cavity to produce iga1 protease and of others to modify the susceptibility of iga1 to cleavage by iga1 protease perhaps enhances their ability to survive in this habitat.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  == the treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. to investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. analyses of  sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that s. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. the pattern of recolonization by individual streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: s. oralis and s. sanguis were primary colonizers while s. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. it is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.

TI  == the use of lectins in monitoring degradation of oligosaccharide chains in mucin by oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of utilize mucin oligosaccharides as sources of carbohydrate and energy is believed to be an important mechanism in the ecology of oral streptococci. in this study we have used digoxigenin-labelled lectins of various  specificities to monitor changes in the nonreducing end groups of oligosaccharide chains following their degradation by streptococcus oralis ny 586 and streptococcus sanguis ny 584. the reaction of degraded mucin with peanut lectin,  that recognizes the core disaccharide gal (1,3)galnac in o-glycans, revealed a more extensive degradation of oligosaccharide by s. oralis than by s. sanguis. this corresponds to better growth of s. oralis on the mucin. analyses with datura stramonium lectin showed that terminal gal (1,4)glcnac, or glcnac (1,4)glcnac moieties, in the oligosaccharides are attacked by both strains. reaction patterns with alpha-l-fucose-specific lectins indicated that terminal fucose was released  by s. oralis but not by s. sanguis. this was in accordance with sugar analyses which showed that approximately 40% of the fucose units were released. the results extend previously observed losses of sugars from oligosaccharide chains during growth of these organisms on mucin.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.

AB  == ag-specific chimeric human iga molecules, of the two human subclasses, iga1 and iga2, have been expressed in two mammalian cell systems. analysis of the secreted iga molecules, purified in milligram quantities from stable chinese hamster ovary transfectants by ag affinity chromatography, has allowed a direct comparison of the biologic properties of the two subclasses. hplc gel filtration analysis revealed that in both subclasses, the iga molecules associate predominantly into  dimers. the monomer units are presumed to interact noncovalently, inasmuch as no  dimers are evident when the antibodies are subjected to sds-page. the recombinant antibodies are glycosylated, inasmuch as a lectin blotting procedure revealed that the h chains of both subclasses are recognized by con a. when subjected to digestion by preparations of iga1-specific proteases secreted by two pathogenic streptococcal strains, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis, the recombinant iga molecules behave just as their natural equivalents. thus, only the chimeric iga1 molecule is cleaved, with the iga2 remaining intact. in terms of interaction with natural effector molecules, both recombinant iga isotypes were shown to interact with fc alpha receptors on calcitriol-stimulated hl-60 cells with similar affinity, but neither antibody was found to interact with human c1q. the expression system described readily permits manipulation of the human iga genes, which should lead to a fuller molecular understanding of how this important antibody mediates its function.

AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis have been divided  into six genetic groups. methods to identify those species by genotype are needed. this study compared restriction fragment polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotypes) for seven s. gordonii, three s. sanguis, four s. oralis, three s. mitis, one s. crista, and seven s. parasanguis strains classified in previous dna hybridization studies, as well as one clinical isolate. dna was digested with hindiii, pvuii, hindiii and pvuii combined, ecori, bamhi, aatii, alwni, and draii. dna fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. parasanguis all showed an isolated 2,290-bp band in aatii ribotypes that was absent from s. gordonii, s. sanguis, and s. crista. the  last three groups showed species-specific bands with aatii and also with pvuii. s. oralis could be distinguished from s. mitis and s. parasanguis in alwni and draii ribotypes. s. mitis and s. parasanguis could not be distinguished, since they shared multiple bands in pvuii, alwni, and ecori patterns. the clinical isolate in the panel was very similar to s. sanguis by all enzymes used. our findings suggest that ribotyping may be useful for genotypic identification of oral viridans streptococci. initial digests of clinical isolates might be made with aatii, followed by pvuii or alwni. isolates then could be identified by comparing ribotype patterns with those of reference strains. this approach could  facilitate clinical studies of these newly defined species.

AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of oral streptococci by classical methods.
AB  == the phenotypic characteristics of 215 strains of oral streptococci were compared  on the basis of the results of sorbitol, raffinose and trehalose fermentation, ammonium from arginine production, aesculin hydrolysis, h2o2 production, susceptibility to 2 u bacitracin, and growth in 4% nacl solution. eleven different species were identified. among the most noteworthy findings were the low number of h2o2-producing strains of streptococcus sobrinus, the effective discrimination between streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis on the basis of raffinose fermentation, and the phenotypic similarity between streptococcus oralis and the former mutans group. to avoid the creation of new species, the term biotype is proposed to designate phenotypically distinct organisms which do  not qualify as different species.

AB  == sera from patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe) due to streptococcus mutans or other oral streptococci and from normal subjects were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to defined s. mutans  antigens. antibodies of igg and iga isotypes to ag i/ii and ag iii were greatly elevated in s. mutans-sbe sera, and the iga antibodies in 3 sera included both polymeric and monomeric forms. elevated igm and igg anti-lipoteichoic acid and igg and iga anti-serotype c polysaccharide antibodies were also found. the sera of 4 of 6 patients infected with other oral streptococci also displayed antibodies to s. mutans ag i/ii. sera of 3 patients infected with streptococcus mitis or streptococcus oralis, but none of the s. mutans-infected cases, showed elevated antibodies to human heart sarcolemma, and all sbe sera had elevated rheumatoid factor. these results suggest that the known surface protein antigens  of s. mutans are immunodominant in humans, and are not likely to be heart cross-reactive.

TI  == complete structure of the adhesin receptor polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 55229 (streptococcus sanguis h1).
AB  == this report describes the determination of the complete primary structure of the  adhesin receptor polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 55229 (previously characterized as streptococcus sanguis h1), a gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental plaque formation. the polysaccharide was isolated from s. oralis atcc 55229 cells after deproteination, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ion exchange chromatography. it was shown to consist of rhamnose, galactose, glucose, glycerol, and phosphate, in molar ratios of 2:3:1:1:1. sequence and linkage assignments of the glycosyl residues were obtained by methylation analysis followed by gas-liquid chromatography and electron-impact mass spectrometry. 31p  nmr spectroscopy revealed that phosphate was present in a diester, connecting glycerol to one of the galactosyl residues. high-performance liquid chromatography of a partial acid hydrolysate of the polysaccharide confirmed this finding by showing galactose 6-phosphate and glycerol 1-phosphate. the structural determination was completed by the combination of two-dimensional homonuclear hartmann-hahn and noe experiments and heteronuclear [1h,13c] and [1h,31p] multiple-quantum coherence experiments. thus, the adhesin receptor polysaccharide of s. oralis atcc 55229 was found to be a polymer composed of hexasaccharide repeating units that contain glycerol linked through a phosphodiester to c6 of the alpha-galactopyranosyl residue and are joined end-to-end through galactofuranosyl-beta(1-->3)-rhamnopyranosyl linkages: [formula: see text] this structure is novel among bacterial cell surface polysaccharides in general and specifically among those implicated in dental plaque formation.

TI  == changes in saliva of epileptic patients.
AB  == unstimulated whole saliva samples of 27 indoor epileptic patients were studied on their protein composition using biochemical and immunochemical methods. a number  of salivary proteins appeared at least partially to be hydrolyzed. in a number of saliva samples the concentration of carbohydrate-containing isoenzymes of amylase was reduced. in addition, the concentration of the 20 kd glycoprotein ep-gp was reduced by 60%. sialic acid, the terminal sugar of the glycoproteins and mucins,  was released for about 50% and in three salivas even nearly completely. moreover, sialic acid- and fucose-containing epitopes could hardly be detected by monoclonal antibodies to human salivary mucins. as a consequence of this hydrolytic breakdown the saliva mediated aggregation of two s. sanguis strains had been reduced. in contrast, the aggregation of s. oralis had been maintained.

TI  == restriction endonuclease-fragment polymorphisms of oral viridans streptococci, compared by conventional and field-inversion gel electrophoresis.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus mitis have recently been divided into four species. two additional species have also been proposed for this group. each species is genetically distinct, but they have many traits in common, which makes it difficult for clinical isolates to be  identified by phenotypic tests. genotypic comparison may provide an alternative approach. this study used dna fingerprint analysis for comparison of genotypes of 21 reference strains--classified as streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, "streptococcus parasanguis", or "streptococcus crista" in previous dna hybridization studies--and 17 clinical and laboratory strains placed in those groups on the basis of phenotypic tests. hindiii and pvuii digests were run in conventional horizontal agarose gels. sfii digests of reference strains and two laboratory strains were run in field-inversion gels. fingerprint patterns were compared by visual examination, cluster analysis of densitometric traces, and lane-matching software. only two "s. crista" strains and two parent mutant lineages showed fingerprint patterns that were identical by visual examination. fingerprint patterns of all other strains were unique. cluster analysis results could not be considered valid, since replicate lanes in  different gels were not grouped together. hindiii and pvuii digests contained too many bands for correct matching by lane-matching software. sfii digests were correctly matched by computer, with the same results as visual examination. results indicate that the diversity of strains within these streptococcal species was too great to permit species identification by dna fingerprint patterns. this  genotypic diversity suggests that isolates from unrelated hosts may have been separate for long periods of time.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == we used an overlay method to study the ability of human salivary glycoproteins to serve as receptors for several strains of streptococci that colonize the oral cavity. parotid and submandibular-sublingual salivas were collected as ductal secretions, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. the resulting blots were overlaid with [35s]methionine-labeled bacteria, and salivary components to which the bacteria bound were detected by autoradiography. potential glycoprotein receptors were identified for 8 of the 16 strains tested. in three cases (streptococcus sanguis 72-40 and 804 and streptococcus sobrinus omz176), highly specific interactions with a single salivary component were detected. removal of  sialic acid residues from the low-molecular-weight salivary mucin prevented adherence of one of these strains (s. sanguis 72-40), suggesting that this saccharide either mediates binding or is a critical component of the receptor site. in the remaining five strains (streptococcus gordonii g9b and 10558, s. sanguis 10556, and streptococcus oralis 10557 and 72-41), interactions with multiple salivary components, including the low-molecular-weight salivary mucin,  highly glycosylated proline-rich glycoproteins, and alpha-amylase, were detected. these results suggest that some oral streptococci can bind specifically to certain of the salivary glycoproteins. the interactions identified may play an important role in governing bacterial adherence and clearance within the oral cavity.

TI  == subclass distribution of salivary secretory immunoglobulin a antibodies to oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of specific secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) antibodies to inhibit  bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces may be neutralized by the activity of  bacterial iga1 proteases. because of the resistance of the iga2 subclass to these enzymes, the biological effect of iga1 proteases in vivo may depend on the subclass distribution of the bacterium-specific antibodies. we have estimated the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies in saliva samples from 13 individuals against iga1 protease-producing (streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis)  and nonproducing (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis bv. 2) oral streptococci. iga1 was found to be the predominant subclass of antibodies against these four bacteria in most of the saliva samples, corroborating previous data suggesting a role of iga1 proteases in plaque formation. however, variation in the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies against the same strain was observed. in one individual, iga2 was the predominant subclass of antibodies against all four streptococci and of total salivary s-iga, pointing to the possible significance of genetic variations. the study also addresses methodological problems related to the quantitation of salivary antibodies by solid-phase immunoassays.

TI  == delineation of a segment of adsorbed salivary acidic proline-rich proteins which  promotes adhesion of streptococcus gordonii to apatitic surfaces.
AB  == cells of several strains of streptococcus gordonii attached in much higher numbers to experimental pellicles formed from samples of submandibular or parotid saliva on hydroxyapatite (ha) beads than to buffer controls. the nature of the salivary components responsible were investigated by preparing experimental pellicles from chromatographic fractions of submandibular saliva obtained from trisacryl gf 2000m columns. adhesion of s. gordonii blackburn was promoted by two groups of fractions. the adhesion-promoting activity in the first group of fractions was associated with the family of acidic proline-rich proteins (prps),  while that of the second group is as yet unidentified. experimental pellicles prepared by treating ha with 2 micrograms of pure 150-amino-acid-residue prps (prp-1, prp-2, and pif-s) promoted adhesion of s. gordonii blackburn cells to an  extent comparable to that obtained with unfractionated saliva. however, pellicles prepared from a 106-residue prp (prp-3) were significantly less effective, and those prepared from the amino-terminal tryptic peptide (residues 1 to 30) of the  prp and the salivary phosphoprotein statherin were completely ineffective in promoting adhesion. although adhesion of several strains of s. gordonii was promoted by adsorbed prp-1, the adhesion of several strains of streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus oralis was either not affected or only weakly enhanced by this protein. s. gordonii cells bound avidly to prps adsorbed onto ha beads, but the streptococci did not appear to bind prps in solution, since concentrations of prp as high as 200 micrograms/ml did not inhibit binding of bacterial cells to pellicles prepared from pure prp. s. gordonii cells also attached well to prp or a synthetic decapeptide representing residues 142 to 150  of the prp when the peptide was linked to agarose beads. studies with a series of synthetic decapeptides indicated that the minimal segment of prp which promoted high levels of s. gordonii adhesion was the carboxy-terminal dipeptide pro-gln (residues 149 and 150).

TI  == conservation of the gene encoding streptococcal antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == the spap gene of streptococcus mutans serotype c encodes a major cell surface protein, streptococcal antigen (sa) i/ii, with an mr of 185,000, that is thought  to be involved in bacterial adhesion to teeth. proteins with significant amino acid sequence homology to sa i/ii have also been found in s. sobrinus and s. sanguis. the objectives of this study were to investigate the conservation of the spap gene in the mutans groups of streptococci and to determine whether homologous genes were present in other species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. dna extracted from representative strains of 19 streptococcal species was examined by southern hybridization and partial dna sequence analysis. a series of five overlapping dna probes from the spap gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used in the southern hybridizations. the entire gene was found to be well conserved in all strains of s. mutans serotypes c, e, and f investigated. a probe from the 3' region of the gene, which encodes residues 857  to 1207 of the sa i/ii protein, hybridized with dna from a number of mutans streptococci, as well as with dna from nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. conservation within this region was further demonstrated by sequencing gene fragments of two strains of s. intermedius and s. oralis. the results show that some regions of the spap gene are highly conserved not only in the mutans group of streptococci but also in other nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. this suggests that a family of cell surface proteins which, by analogy with the 185,000-mr sa i/ii of s. mutans, could be involved in bacterial adhesion might exist.

TI  == synergistic degradation of mucin by streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis in mixed chemostat cultures.
AB  == oral streptococci can grow in mucin by utilizing the oligosaccharide chains as a  source of carbohydrate. the degradation of the oligosaccharides by these species  is accomplished by exoglycosidase activities. in this experiment, it was investigated whether strains from different species could cooperate in the release of sugars from the mucin oligosaccharide. to this end, streptococcus sanguis ny 584 and streptococcus oralis strain ny 586 were grown continuously in  a chemically-defined medium, with pig gastric mucin as the growth-limiting source of carbohydrate. in pure cultures, strain ny 586 attained approximately three-fold-higher cell densities than did strain ny 584 in the mucin medium. this was in accordance with the observation that s. oralis ny 586 exhibited fucosidase activity, as indicated by the presence of fucose in the culture fluid. in contrast, strain ny 584 has no fucosidase activity against mucin, and therefore cannot attack fucose-ending oligosaccharide chains. stable mixed cultures of the  strains were obtained. it appeared that s. sanguis ny 584 reached significantly higher cell densities in mixed cultures with s. oralis ny 586 than in pure culture. stimulation of the growth of strain ny 584 was probably due to the generation of non-fucose-ending oligosaccharide chains by fucosidase from strain  ny 586. it is concluded that the synergistic degradation of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins is a potential factor influencing the streptococcal populations in  the mouth.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. this paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. in all streptococci the embden-meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form  formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. if sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. this enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. the characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like s. sanguis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria  in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth  and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.

TI  == platelet aggregation by oral streptococci.
AB  == one proposed mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis is the direct aggregation of platelets by the bacteria causing the disease. some, but not all, strains of streptococcus sanguis have been reported to aggregate platelets but the taxonomy of this and related taxa has changed recently. the ability to aggregate platelets by 24 genetically grouped laboratory stock strains was studied along with 8 recent isolates from cases of endocarditis. strains belonging to s. sanguis could aggregate platelets, but not s. gordonii, "s. parasanguis", s. mitis, s. oralis or related taxa. also, preliminary data indicate that certain biotypes of s. sanguis lack the ability to aggregate platelets. of the recent clinical isolates, only 4 aggregated platelets and each  of these showed phenotypes typical of s. sanguis. these data suggest that the ability to aggregate platelets is not essential for an organism to be able to cause endocarditis, although it may be a significant virulence factor.

TI  == penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci have obtained altered penicillin-binding protein genes from penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with decreased affinity for penicillin. the pbp2b genes of these strains have a mosaic structure, consisting of regions that  are very similar to those in penicillin-sensitive strains, alternating with regions that are highly diverged. penicillin-resistant strains of viridans groups streptococci (e.g., s. sanguis and s. oralis) that produce altered pbps have also been reported. the pbp2b genes of two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of s. sanguis were identical in sequence to the mosaic class b pbp2b genes found in  penicillin-resistant serotype 23 strains of s. pneumoniae. emergence of penicillin resistance appears to have occurred by the horizontal transfer of an altered pbp2b gene from penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae into s. sanguis. the pbp2b genes of three penicillin-resistant s. oralis strains were similar to the mosaic class b pbp2b gene of penicillin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae but possessed an additional block of diverged sequence. penicillin resistance in s. oralis has also probably arisen by horizontal transfer of this variant form of the class b mosaic pbp2b gene from a penicillin-resistant strain of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == in vitro adherence of microorganisms to denture base resin with different surface texture.
AB  == we examined the effects of various denture base resin surface textures on the adherence of microorganisms. s. sanguis and b. gingivalis adhered in greater amounts to the denture base resin than the other microorganisms tested. as to bacterial adherence according to polishing state, s. oralis, b. gingivalis c-101, and b. intermedius c-001 more adhered to the no. 400 paper-polished surface than  to the buff-polished and smoothening-treated surfaces. s. sanguis less adhered to the smoothening-treated surface. s. mitis and c. albicans, on the other hand, more adhered to the smoothening-treated surface. for the other microorganisms tested, no relationship was observed between surface texture and bacterial adherence. the fall-off test revealed no remarkable differences in the fall-off of s. sanguis and b. gingivalis c-101 by the types of surface treatment. however, the fall-off of c. albicans was poorest from the no. 400 paper-polished surface.  these results indicate that smoothening the denture base surface is important for denture plaque control.

TI  == involvement of human mucous saliva and salivary mucins in the aggregation of the  oral bacteria streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus rattus.
AB  == the contribution of human parotid (par) and submandibular/sublingual (sm/sl) saliva and of the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) to saliva-induced bacterial aggregation was studied for s. sanguis c476, s. oralis i581, and s. rattus hg 59. the mucous sm/sl saliva showed a much higher aggregation potency towards the s. sanguis and s. oralis strain than did the serous par saliva. the sm/sl saliva-induced aggregation was observed after 30 min, at 60 min followed by the par saliva-induced aggregation, and showed a 4-fold higher aggregation titer  of 128 for s. sanguis, and an 8-fold higher titer of 516 for s. oralis. in contrast, the par saliva showed a slightly higher aggregation activity than the sm/sl saliva towards s. rattus as judged by a twofold higher titer of 64. morphologically, however, the sm/sl saliva-induced aggregation of s. rattus was far more pronounced as was also found for s. sanguis. finally, the hwsm-induced aggregation showed a 4 to 8-fold higher titer than the originating salivary source, measuring 2048 for s. oralis and 128 for s. rattus. moreover, no difference was observed in aggregation activity between the hwsm from whole saliva of a blood group o donor and the hwsm from sm/sl saliva of a blood group a donor. all the data point to an important, though not exclusive role of the human salivary mucin fraction in the saliva-induced aggregation of these strains.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == molecular aspects of immunoglobulin a1 degradation by oral streptococci.
AB  == using a panel of 143 strains classified according to a novel taxonomic system for oral viridans-type streptococci, we reexamined the ability of oral streptococci to attack human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) molecules with iga1 protease or glycosidases. iga1 protease production was an exclusive property of all strains belonging to streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis (previously s. mitior) and of some strains of streptococcus mitis biovar 1. these are all dominant initiators of dental plaque formation. degradation of the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules accompanied iga1 protease activity in s. oralis and protease-producing strains of s. mitis biovar 1. neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase were identified as extracellular enzymes in organisms of these taxa. by examination with enzyme-neutralizing antisera, four distinct iga1 proteases were detected in s. sanguis biovars 1 to 3, s. sanguis biovar 4, s. oralis, and strains of s. mitis, respectively. the cleavage of iga1 molecules by  streptococcal iga proteases was found to be influenced by their state of glycosylation. treatment of iga1 with bacterial (including streptococcal) neuraminidase increased susceptibility to protease, suggesting a cooperative activity of streptococcal iga1 protease and neuraminidase. in contrast, a decrease in susceptibility was observed after extensive deglycosylation of the hinge region with endo-alpha-n acetylgalactosaminidase. the effector functions of iga antibodies depend on the carbohydrate-containing fc portion. hence, the observation that oral streptococci may cleave not only the alpha 1 chains but also the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules suggests that the ability to evade secretory immune mechanisms may contribute to the successful establishment of these bacteria in the oral cavity.

TI  == proteolytic activity of oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were the least proteolytic of 8 species of oral streptococci while streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis were the most proteolytic. degradation of fitc-bsa was significantly correlated with the hydrolysis of synthetic endopeptidase substrates. as s. oralis strains proliferate in dental plaque in the absence of dietary food their success, in vivo, might be due partially to their greater proteolytic activity compared to other oral streptococci.

TI  == cohesion between oral streptococci and neisseria pharyngis on saliva-coated glass, in the presence and absence of sucrose.
AB  == ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of neisseria  pharyngis. strains of mutans streptococci, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitis were able  to cohere with n. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. the cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera  or modification of the salivary pellicle by n. pharyngis mw2. s. sanguis ii and streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the n. pharyngis strain. extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or s. oralis and n. pharyngis mw2.

TI  == amylase-binding as a discriminator among oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of 51 strains, belonging to streptococcus sanguis, 's. mitior', s. oralis and related groups, to bind salivary amylase was studied. most strains were grouped according to their dna-relatedness and then compared using 14 phenotypic tests. s. mitis, 's. mitior' and three relatively new groups of strains ('cr', 'mgh' and 'tufted mitior') bound salivary amylase, while strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis did not. the ability of strains to bind amylase or not was remarkably consistent within groups and the test proved to be reproducible, rapid and easy to perform. combination of the amylase-binding test  with 6 other conventional physiological tests allowed the construction of a dichotomous identification key which correctly identified 95% of strains for which genetic data was available. these findings suggest that the ability of organisms to bind salivary amylase could become a key test in identification schemes for certain oral streptococci.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to composite resin restorative materials.
AB  == the frequency of oral streptococcal bacterial isolates detected on composite resin squares attached to maxillary first molars in 12 volunteers was 62.1 per cent. these cocci consisted of streptococcus mitior (52.8 per cent), s. sanguis (20.2 per cent), s. oralis (8.6 per cent), s. salivarius (1.0 per cent) and s. anginosus (0.3 per cent). an electron microscopic study of these organisms labelled with [3h]thymidine for in vitro adhesiveness to the resin revealed that  s. mitior was the most adhesive, and that its pronounced adhesiveness is associated with its characteristic extracellular ultrastructure.

TI  == iga1 proteases of oral streptococci: ecological aspects.
AB  == the ecology and identity of iga1 protease-producing streptococci in the human oral cavity were studied in an attempt to obtain insight into the significance of iga1 proteases for host-parasite relationships. contrary to previous observations, a detailed taxonomic analysis of oral streptococci revealed that all strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis ("s.mitior") produced iga1 protease. in addition, iga1 protease activity was observed in some isolates of s.mitis. of the streptococci that initiate plaque formation on dental enamel 88% (median value) had iga1 protease activity. low proportions of the streptococci that colonize the tongue and oropharyngeal mucosae produced iga1 protease, in contrast to 60% of streptococci isolated from buccal mucosa. the iga1 proteases from s. sanguis i-iii, s. sanguis iv, s. oralis, and s.mitis were distinct as revealed by studies using enzyme-neutralizing antibodies.

TI  == surface structures, co-aggregation and adherence phenomena of streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == seven strains of streptococcus oralis were found to possess surface structures. four strains possessed long fimbriae which ranged in length from 266-366 nm, while the remaining three strains possessed shorter peritrichously distributed fibrils which ranged in length from 80-197 nm. the fibrillar strains were morphologically similar to strains of streptococcus sanguis i and ii and streptococcus mitis. no strain of s. oralis produced tufts of fibrils like certain strains of s. sanguis i. strains of streptococcus milleri produced peritrichously distributed fimbriae which were morphologically dissimilar to the  fimbriae produced by s. oralis strains. s. oralis strains were moderately to highly hydrophobic, but hydrophobicity could not be related to adhesion parameters or type or length or density of surface structures. furthermore, there appeared to be no correlation between type of surface structures and adhesion parameters. two of the three fibrillar strains of s. oralis and the peritrichously fibrillar strains of s. sanguis, together with one strain of s. milleri, were able to co-aggregate with actinomycetes.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == genetic relationships among the oral streptococci.
AB  == genetic relationships and species limits among the oral streptococci were determined by an analysis of electrophoretically demonstrable variation in 16 metabolic enzymes. fifty isolates represented 40 electrophoretic types, among which the mean genetic diversity per locus was 0.857. mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase was not detected in isolates of the sanguis species complex, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were absent in species of the mutans complex. clustering from a matrix of gower's coefficient of genetic similarity placed the 40 electrophoretic types in 10 well-defined groups corresponding to the streptococcus species s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. cricetus, s. rattus, s. ferus, s. oralis (mitior), two distinct assemblages of s. sanguis strains, and two subdivisions of "s. milleri." the assignments of isolates to these groups were the same as those indicated by dna hybridization experiments, and the coefficient of correlation between genetic distance estimated by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and genetic similarity indexed by dna hybridization was -0.897 (p less than 0.001) for 50 pairwise combinations of isolates. s. ferus, which is widely believed to be a member of the mutans complex, was shown to be phylogenetically closer to species of the sanguis complex.

TI  == microbiology of the early colonization of human enamel and root surfaces in vivo.
AB  == this study describes the predominant early microflora on human teeth on the basis of microbiologic identification of 1742 fresh isolates. the isolates were obtained from four dental students who carried test pieces of enamel and root surface in the oral cavity for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. during the experimental periods oral hygiene was discontinued. under equal conditions root surfaces were  more heavily colonized than were enamel surfaces. however, the composition of the microbiota was the same. within the first 24 h the microflora was dominated by streptococci and gram-positive pleomorphic rods. s. sanguis contributed only 6-18% of the early colonizers whereas s. mitis and s. oralis varied between 24-42% and 1-27% (mean values), respectively. the relative proportion of s. oralis increased significantly within the observation period while the proportion of s. salivarius and arginine-positive s. mitis showed a declining tendency. actinomyces species adsorbed to the tooth surfaces within the first 4 h but did not increase their relative proportions until after 8-12 h, possibly due to a long doubling time. in one individual, encapsulated bacteria resembling stomatococcus mucilaginosus were observed among the early colonizers. the time-dependent shifts in the bacterial populations within 24 h corroborate parallel ultrastructural findings.

TI  == a simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  == a simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. the method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to dna. results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. all species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains  of streptococcus rattus and streptococcus mutans. the major extracellular polysaccharide produced by streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. most streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. soluble fructan was produced by some strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis. the latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. no detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by streptococcus milleri, streptococcus faecalis or streptococcus lactis.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
