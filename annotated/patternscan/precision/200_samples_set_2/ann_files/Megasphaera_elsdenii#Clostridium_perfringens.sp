TI  == obligately anaerobic bacterial species isolated from foot-rot lesions in goats.
AB  == lesions showing clinical signs of foot-rot from 120 goats were cultured on six selective media during october 1987 to november 1988. a total of 582 strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to 50 different species was isolated and identified. the anaerobes most frequently isolated belonged to the following genera: bacteroides (80%), peptostreptococcus (63.6%), megasphaera (40%), fusobacterium (29.2%), clostridium (22.5%), propionibacterium (12.5%), eubacterium (11.7%) and leptotrichia (10.8%). percentages for acidaminococcus, peptococcus, tissierella, wolinella and veillonella were below 10%. the following species were identified in 10% or more of cases: peptostreptococcus anaerobius (61.7%), bacteroides buccae (51.7%), bacteroides nodosus (42.5%), megasphaera elsdenii (40%), bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis (22.5%), fusobacterium necrophorum (19.2%), leptotrichia buccalis (11.7%) and clostridium perfringens (10%). lower percentages were obtained for the remaining species. the efficiency  and selectivity of the six culture media used for isolation are discussed.
