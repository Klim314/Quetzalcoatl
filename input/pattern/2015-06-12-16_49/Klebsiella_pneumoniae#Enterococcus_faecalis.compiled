TI  - Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne Essential Oil.
AB  - Eyebright, Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne (Scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. Some Euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. However, the composition and bioactivity of E. rostkoviana oil are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). The essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The best activity was observed against all Gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition of E. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Urinary tract infections and antimicrobial sensitivity among diabetic patients at Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are more susceptible to urinary  tract infection (UTI) than non-diabetics. Due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) uropathogenic strains, the choice of antimicrobial agent is restricted. This study investigated the epidemiology of UTI, antimicrobial susceptibility, and resistance patterns of bacterial isolates from adult diabetic patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Khartoum Hospital, Sudan during the period of March - September 2013. Consecutive patients (men and women) were approached to participate in the study, irrespective of UTI symptoms. Socio-demographic and clinical data were obtained from each participant using pre-tested questionnaires. Clean-catch, midstream urine samples were collected and cultured for UTI diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility. Symptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture (>/=10(5) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL of a single bacterial species) from patients with symptoms associated with UTI; asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture from patients without symptoms associated with UTI. RESULTS: A total of 200 diabetic patients were enrolled, 121 (60.5%) men and 79 (39.5%) women; 193 (96.5%) had type II DM. The overall prevalence of UTI was 39 (19.5%). Among the total population, 17.1% and 20.9% had symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria, respectively. According to multivariate logistic regression, none of the investigated factors (age, sex, type of DM and duration) were associated with UTI. The predominant isolates were Escherichia coli (22, [56.4%]), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, [9, (23%)]. Eight of 22 E. coli, four of nine K. pneumoniae and one of five Enterococcus faecalis isolates originated from symptomatic patients. Six, four, three, and two of 22 E. coli isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, respectively. Two, two, one and one of nine K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, cephalexin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. All 22 E. coli isolates were sensitive (100%) to gentamicin and cephalexin. All nine K. pneumoniae were sensitive to gentamicin (100%) and 88.8% were sensitive to cephalexin. CONCLUSION: In Sudan, about one-fifth of diabetic patients have UTI. E. coli is the most frequent isolate followed by K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.
TI  - Nanostructured sensor based on carbon nanotubes and clavanin A for bacterial detection.
AB  - Unusual methods for specific detection of pathogenic bacteria are becoming key points for control and identification of problems related to health and (bio)safety. In this context, this work aims to propose a new approach for the development of nanostructured biosensors based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and antimicrobial peptides for bacterial detection. Firstly, the antimicrobial peptide clavanin A (ClavA) was chemically immobilized on CNTs and surface-immobilized ClavA was used to detect Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in a direct assay format. We used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique to evaluate the effectiveness and sensitivity of the ClavA-based biosensors by measuring the modifications in their electrochemical responses before and after incubation in presence of different bacteria concentrations. The biosensor was able to discriminate between bacteria concentrations in the 102-106CFUmL-1 range. Atomic force microscopy analysis confirmed the biosensor functionality for bacterial recognition. This new sensor system was capable of differentiating between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, since ClavA showed different affinities toward the pathogenic bacteria species.
TI  - Fluoroquinolone resistance in bacteremic and low risk febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The low risk febrile neutropenic patients with Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score of more than 20 are recommended to be treated with fluoroquinolone-based oral treatment by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline. This recommendation relies, at least partially, on the high sensitivity of the blood culture isolates to fluoroquinolone in clinical trials conducted in Western countries. Whether this also applies in middle or low income countries like China where antibiotic resistance is becoming prevalent recently has not been evaluated. METHODS: All the positive blood culture results from January 2010 to December 2013 in the 2 large Chinese cancer centers were reviewed. The patients were included into the study with the following criteria: febrile neutropenia, solid tumor or lymphoma, MASCC score >20, positive blood cultures within two days of the onset of fever, and detailed treatment history. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included in this analysis. Two patients had polymicrobial bacteremia (Enterococcus faecalis and Flavimonas oryzihabitans). Other isolates included coagulase-negative staphylococcus, micrococcal species, viridans streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The majority of the monomicrobial isolates from these 36 patients was Escherichia coli (28 patients, 74%). Notably, in contrast to the high sensitivity to fluoroquinolone from blood culture of the low risk patients in previous reports in Westen countries, a very high drug resistance was observed: 13 out of 28 Escherichia coli isolates (46%) or 14 out of all 38 positive cultures (37%). CONCLUSION: The results warrant further validations in prospective clinical trials in countries where antibiotic resistance is prevalent to ensure appropriate antibiotic administration.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Diagnostic and therapeutic utility of transrectal ultrasound in urological office prostatic abscess management: a short report from a single urologic center.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prostatic abscess (PA) is an infrequent condition in the modern antibiotic era. The everyday use of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) during diagnostic work-up and the widespread recurrence to prostatic biopsies may lead to an increase of PA diagnosis. In this short report we analyze the patients characteristics and the management of seven recent cases of PA diagnosed in our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 7 patients admitted to our Center for LUTS associated to septic fever or acute urinary retention, was prospectively collected. Suspect of PA was done on digital rectal examination (DRE) and confirmed by TRUS performed after urinary system ultrasound (UUS) evaluation. Patients were admitted to hospital only in case of septic signs. A sovrapubic (SPC) or urethral catheter (UC) was placed depending on symptoms. A TRUS-guided aspiration of PA was performed with patient in lithotomic position, using a 18 gauge two-part needle, side/end fire needle access. Patient was discharged with antibiotic therapy and followed up until complete resolution of the PA and symptoms. RESULTS: Mean age was 62 years (range 24-82). Two patients were diabetics and one was affected by the immunodeficiency acquired syndrome (HIV). In one case, PA was detected after a persistent fever post TRUS guided prostate biopsy. Average prostate volume was 69 ml (range 19-118 ml). DRE was able to diagnose PA only in 2 cases (29%), UUS evaluation in 1 case (14%). All cases were confirmed by TRUS as hypo-anechoic areas with or without internal echoes in all patients. Mean PA dimension was 3.64 cm (range 1.5-8). SPC was placed in 3 cases (43%), UC in 3 patients (43%). Only 1 patient refused catheterization. Side fire needle aspiration was performed in all cases and in combination with end fire access in case of particular location of abscess cavities. Second look was needed in 2 cases (29%). Antibiotics were administered in all cases. The aspirated pus showed a positive culture for Escherichia coli (43%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Enterococcus faecalis (14%). PA resolution time mean was 9 days (range 3-24). CONCLUSIONS: TRUS evaluation in case of persistent LUTS associated with fever or acute urinary retention is determinant in the diagnosis of PA. Office or institutional management with TRUS needle aspiration is a good option in these cases.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF 7.
AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of Solanum trilobatum. The aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. The bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. In addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7) using MTT, nuclear morphology assay, Western blot and RT-PCR expression. These results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using S. trilobatum fruits.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - [The urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  - Twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. Single-J ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. Pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. Forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients. Thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Proteus (P.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. One methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strain was isolated. Thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. E. faecalis (23.1%), Eschericia (E.) coli (23.1%) and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. One E. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and one MRCNS strain were isolated. Pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. The patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). P. aeruginosa (26.9%), E. faecium (15.4%), and P. mirabilis (11.5%) were isolated inhigh frequency. One E. coli strain harboring ESBL and one P. mirabilis strain harboring ESBL were isolated. In conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of A. retroflexus.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 muL/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, C. famata, C. utilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (MIC determination) for antimicrobial activity and TEAC (Trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. The adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of A. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. The extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis with no activity against S. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against C. famata by both extracts. The A. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the P. aeruginosa clinical strain. The inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on B. subtilis strain. The antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of Rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ethanolic extract of rose (Rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterized AgNPs showed an effective antibacterial activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) than Gram positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. MTT assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. In addition, green synthesized AgNPs also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (O2(-) and NO) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing IgG (Intraglobin/Intratect) or a mixture of IgG, IgA, and IgM (Pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. The target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. RESULTS: All strains were killed to at least 50% by Pentaglobin. One P. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by Intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by Intraglobin to a similar degree compared to Pentaglobin. Opsonic IgG antibodies against E. faecalis were directed against LTA, while opsonic antibodies in Pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. In a mouse bacteremia model, Pentaglobin was more protective than Intratect against Staphylococcus aureus, while Intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. CONCLUSIONS: All tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enrichment of these preparations with IgM increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.
TI  - Comparative prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired urinary  tract infection cases from representative States of northern and southern India.
AB  - CONTEXT: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are amongst the most common infections described in outpatient settings. Increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of urinary tract pathogens is a matter of global public health concern. Treatment of UTI depends on both prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of causative bacteria at any specific geographical location. AIM: This study was undertaken to compare the prevalence of uropathogens and their AMR profile in two different geographical parts of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clean-catch mid-stream urine samples were collected from adult patients, bacterial flora isolated from human urine was evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility profile using Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method among patients from Hyderabad (Southern India), Rajasthan and Punjab (Northern India). The data were analysed using Chi-square (chi2) test, confidence interval (CI), odds ratio (OR) analysis and p-value using SPSS 16 software. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (55.1%) were the most prevalent isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (15.8%). Amikacin was the most active antimicrobial agents which showed low resistance rate of 14%. The present study revealed the geographical difference in prevalence of uropathogens with Klebsiella pneumoniae being the second most common uropathogen followed by E. faecalis in the states from northern India while no K. pneumoniae was seen in samples from southern India but E. faecalis was the second most prevalent organism. CONCLUSION: Therefore, development of regional surveillance programs is highly recommended for implementation of national CA-UTI guidelines in Indian settings.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Biological Activities of xylooligosaccharides generated from garlic straw xylan by purified xylanase from Bacillus mojavensis UEB-FK.
AB  - A newly isolated Bacterium strain named UEB-FK was selected from Tunisian Sahara, exhibiting the highest clear zone on agar plates containing oat spelt xylan by staining with Congo red. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence analysis, this strain was identified as Bacillus mojavensis. This strain produced extracellular xylanase. Xylanase from the strain was purified to homogeneity and had an apparent molecular weight of 14 kDa. The K m and V max values of the purified xylanase on oat spelt xylan were 3.85 mg/mL and 250.02 U/mg, respectively. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme were found to be 4.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, and the enzyme exhibited significant heat stability. In addition, the enzyme was found to be stable in a wide range of pH (3-9). The main hydrolysis products yielded from garlic straw-extracted xylan were xylobiose and xylotriose. The antioxidant and antibacterial activities of xylan oligosaccharide (XOS) were investigated. As regards to the in vitro antioxidant activities, the XOS showed a important DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.45 mg/mL) and a high beta-carotene bleaching (IC50 = 2.2 mg/mL). Furthermore, XOS had a high antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Clinical epidemiological study on the incidence of Escherichia coli infections in the cancer patients admitted to Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013.
AB  - The aim of study was to identify pathogens involved in hospital-acquired or community-acquired infections in patients suffering from various types of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical epidemiological study included a group of 355 cancer patients admitted and operated at the Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013 was performed using data from hospital statistical service and the surgery and laboratory records, then processed by epidemi ological and statistical methods. RESULTS: In cancer patients the pathogen most commonly involved in infections was E. coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter. Analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of the pathogen most commonly involved revealed that of the 29 E. coli strains 22 were tested for resistance/sensitivity to ampicillin; of these, 19 strains showed resistance, and only 3 were sensitive; 14 E. coli strains of were resistant to cephalosporins and 8 sensitive; all strains tested were sensitive to carbapenems, imipenem or meropenem and polypeptides (colistin); the 10 tested strains showed resistance to monobactams (aztreonam). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was incriminated in most urinary tract infections, the other pathogens being identified sporadically. Surgical wound infections were caused mostly by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In our study we encountered increased resistance of E. coli to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams (aztreonam), fluoro-quinolones and tetracyclines.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological characteristic of infectious purulent complications in patients after related renal transplantation].
AB  - We investigated the frequency and characteristics of infectious purulent and non-infectious complications in living related renal transplant recipients in early postoperative period. It was identified the prevalent microorganisms in urinary tract infections and its antibiotic sensitivity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans. 182 strains of bacteria and Candida were isolated from urine of renal graft patients in early postoperative period (from 2 days to 3 months). The prevention and treatment schemes, antimicrobial drugs dosing regimen were developed. It leads to decrease the infectious complications rate.
TI  - Pyranoside-into-furanoside rearrangement: new reaction in carbohydrate chemistry  and its application in oligosaccharide synthesis.
AB  - Great interest in natural furanoside-containing compounds has challenged the development of preparative methods for their synthesis. Herein a novel reaction in carbohydrate chemistry, namely a pyranoside-into-furanoside (PIF) rearrangement permitting the transformation of selectively O-substituted pyranosides into the corresponding furanosides is reported. The discovered process includes acid-promoted sulfation accompanied by rearrangement of the pyranoside ring into a furanoside ring followed by solvolytic O-desulfation. This process, which has no analogy in organic chemistry, was shown to be a very useful tool for the synthesis of furanoside-containing complex oligosaccharides, which was demonstrated by synthesizing disaccharide derivatives alpha-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-Galf-OPr, 3-O-s-lactyl-beta-D-Galf-(1-->3)-beta-D-Glcp-OPr, and alpha-L-Fucf-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpA-OPr related to polysaccharides from the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and the brown seaweed Chordaria flagelliformis.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria grow within Candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  - The human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. A major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. We examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, Candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. We observed that biofilms formed by C. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. We also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in C. albicans, including upregulation of WOR1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in C. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. Finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, C. perfringens induces aggregation of C. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow C. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. This work indicates that bacteria and C. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.
TI  - LpxC inhibitors as new antibacterial agents and tools for studying regulation of  lipid A biosynthesis in Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - The problem of multidrug resistance in serious Gram-negative bacterial pathogens  has escalated so severely that new cellular targets and pathways need to be exploited to avoid many of the preexisting antibiotic resistance mechanisms that are rapidly disseminating to new strains. The discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of LpxC, the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid A, represents a clinically unprecedented strategy to specifically act against Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae. In this report, we describe the microbiological characterization of LpxC-4, a recently disclosed inhibitor of this bacterial target, and demonstrate that its spectrum of activity extends to several of the pathogenic species that are most threatening to human health today. We also show that spontaneous generation of LpxC-4 resistance occurs at frequencies comparable to those seen with marketed antibiotics, and we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of resistance utilized by target pathogens. Interestingly, these isolates also served as tools to further our understanding of the regulation of lipid A biosynthesis and enabled the discovery that this process occurs very distinctly between P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Finally, we demonstrate that LpxC-4 is efficacious in vivo against multiple strains in different models of bacterial infection and that the major first-step resistance mechanisms employed by the intended target organisms can still be effectively treated with this new inhibitor. IMPORTANCE: New antibiotics are needed for the effective treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens, and the responsibility of identifying new drug candidates rests squarely on the shoulders of the infectious disease community. The limited number of validated cellular targets and approaches, along with the increasing amount of antibiotic resistance that is spreading throughout the clinical environment, has prompted us to explore the utility of inhibitors of novel targets and pathways in these resistant organisms, since preexisting target-based resistance should be negligible. Lipid A biosynthesis is an essential process for the formation of lipopolysaccharide, which is a critical component of the Gram-negative outer membrane. In this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of novel inhibitors of LpxC, an enzyme whose activity is required for proper lipid A biosynthesis, and demonstrate that our lead compound has the requisite attributes to warrant further consideration as a novel antibiotic.
TI  - Terpenoids, flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives from Salvia viridis L. cvar.  Blue Jeans.
AB  - Three diterpenoids, 1-oxomicrostegiol (1), viroxocin (2), viridoquinone (3), were isolated from the roots of Salvia viridis L. cvar. Blue Jeans. Five known diterpenoids, microstegiol (4), 7alpha-acetoxy-14-hydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (5; 7-O-acetylhorminone tautomer), 7alpha,14-dihydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (6; horminone tautomer), ferruginol and salvinolonyl 12-methyl ether (7) were also found in the roots together with 1-docosyl ferulate (8), and a mixture of 2-(4'-alkoxyphenyl) ethyl alkanoates (9). Two lupane triterpenoids, 2alpha-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-3beta-ol (10), and 3beta-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-2alpha-ol (11) were found in the aerial parts together with known compounds, lup-20(29)-ene-2alpha,3beta-diol (12), ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol glucoside. A known phenylpropanoid, trans-verbascoside (or acteoside; 13), was the main constituent in the polar fraction of the aerial part, and it is now reported in the genus Salvia for the first time. Other polyphenolic compounds were cis-verbascoside (14), leucosceptoside A (15), martynoside (16), caffeic acid, 6-O-caffeoyl-glucose (18), rosmarinic acid, salidroside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside, and apigenin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside. The structures were determined by 1D-, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS techniques. Compounds 6, 10, ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 775) with MIC 50 muM, 25 muM, 50 muM, 12.5 muM, 12.5 muM respectively. Ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were also active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6571), and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 2599) with MIC 12.5-50 muM. 4 was also active against S.aureus (ATCC 6571) with MIC 50 muM. These values are consistent with previous studies on the antimicrobial activity of Salvia diterpenoids.
TI  - Changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rates of postneurosurgical infections, particularly meningitis and the most common pathogens have been reported variable during the recent years. The aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of postneurosurgical meningitis and its current spectrum of infectious agent. METHODS: In a descriptive study, the postneurosurgical patients' cerebrospinal fluid was cultured on blood and MacConkey agar plates and evaluated at Microbiology Laboratory. 55 significant isolates as species level were recognized by bacteriological techniques. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) was the most common organism [29(52.7%)], followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae [8(14.5%)], Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [6(10.9%)], Staphylococcus saprophyticus [5(9.1%)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3(5.5%)], Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [3(5.5%)], and Enterococcus faecalis [1(1.8%)]. The majority of A. baumannii isolates were carbapenem-resistant. CONCLUSION: Our research revealed that the rate of postneurosurgical meningitis due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been increased. This finding emphasized the importance of preventive strategies against A. baumannii. The changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis over time suggests the necessity of other studies.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - Quantification of polyphenols and evaluation of antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vast numbers of plant species from northeastern Brazil have not yet been phytochemically or biologically evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this work was to obtain, characterize and show the antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant material (100g) was dried, and the crude extracts were obtained by using turbo-extraction (10%; w/v) with water or acetone:water (7:3, v/v) as the extraction solvent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to screen the crude extracts for hydrolysable tannins (gallic acid) and condensed tannins (catechins). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar-diffusion and microdilution methods against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis INCQS 00016, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) as well as Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis INCQS 00258, Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella pneumoniae). To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity, a leukocyte migration model was used. Analgesic activity was determined by the hot plate test and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Parapiptadenia rigida presented the highest amount of total polyphenols (35.82 +/- 0.20%), while the greatest catechin content was found in the acetone-water extract of Psidium guajava (EAWPg; 1.04 mug/g). The largest amounts of catechins were found in the aqueous extract of Libidibia ferrea (EALf; 1.07 mug/g) and the acetone-water extract of Parapiptadenia rigida (EAWPr; 1.0 mug/g). All extracts showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Psidium guajava showed the greatest inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests. In the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the most susceptible Gram-positive bacterium was Staphylococcus epidermidis and the most susceptible Gram-negative bacterium was Shigella flexneri. EAPg and EAWPg showed the greatest MIC values. All extracts were significant inhibitors of leukocyte migration (p<0.05). Using the writhing test, significant analgesic activity was found for EAPr (50 mg/kg), EAWPr (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and EAWPg (50 mg/kg) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the appropriate extraction procedure preserves the chemical components such as gallic acid and catechin, and showed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy-a new strategy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are extensively used as prophylaxis for transrectal  ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate (TRUBP). Emerging fluoroquinolone resistance and selection of multiresistant organisms warrant new prophylactic strategies. Pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid have mutual synergistic activity and the combination of these agents has a broad coverage of the majority of microorganisms causing infectious complications after TRUBP and may be a valuable future prophylactic regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 2624 men that underwent TRUBP at a Danish university hospital. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 1220) received ciprofloxacin before TRUBP, Group 2 (n = 240) received a combination of pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before TRUBP and Group 3 (n = 1161) received an extended prophylaxis with pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before and for 2 days after TRUBP. RESULTS: One hundred and ten out of 148 (74.3%) post-TRUBP infections were caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterococcus faecalis. Group 3 with the extended prophylaxis with pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid had a significantly lower rate of bacteraemia (0.9%) as compared with Group 1 (1.8%) and Group 2 (3.7%). A significant fall in the proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was observed from the period when ciprofloxacin was used as prophylaxis (8.1%) compared with the subsequent period when pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was used (5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is an attractive prophylaxis for TRUBP from a clinical, bacteriological and ecological point of view as compared with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Central line-associated bloodstream infection in a trauma intensive care unit: impact of implementation of Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America/Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the impact implementation of the basic Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America/Infectious Diseases Society of America (SHEA/IDSA) practice recommendations in reducing central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: The prospective study was conducted from January 2011-December 2012 at the 23-bed trauma ICU in Saudi Arabia. The basic SHEA/IDSA practice recommendations were introduced and implemented during the year 2012. Laboratory-confirmed CLABSIs were identified, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was determined. Data were collected and analyzed for benchmarking with the National Healthcare Safety Network. RESULTS: There was a 58% decline in the CLABSI incidence rate from 3.87 to 1.5 per 1,000 central line days in 2011 and 2012, respectively (standardized infection ratio, 0.42; P = .043). Three institutional risk factors were identified and resolved: health care personnel education, removal of nonessential catheters, and use of a catheter cart. Three Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates susceptible only to imipenem, 1 pandrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and 2 Enterococcus faecalis, with 1 isolate resistant to vancomycin, were identified in 2012. CONCLUSION: The basic SHEA/ISDA practice recommendation is an effective prevention model for the reduction of CLABSIs in the ICU. Additional measures are needed to control the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Role of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  - Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. Recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (rUTI) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. For patients, rUTI is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality of life. Standard treatment of rUTI is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. Repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase of resistance of uropathogenic strains. According to the European Association of Urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". Our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention of rUTI. Total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our open-label post-marketing trial. Each patient had more than one year history of rUTI and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. The trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R) together with the standard antibacterial medication. According to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by Escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. Each woman was involved as the intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. The women received only vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R). 65 patients of the control group had more than one year history of rUTI and had been treated earlier, too. Patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without Solco-Urovac(R). After therapy and follow-up examination, results in the both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. During the follow-up period no case of rUTI was noticed in women. In total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of rUTI in 46 patients during the follow-up period. Altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. Through comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of rUTI episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of Solco-Urovac(R). The results of our post-marketing trial allow recommending Solco-Urovac(R) for appropriate reference within the Georgian National Guideline on Urologic Infections.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its antibacterial susceptibility pattern among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at kanpur, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in pregnant  women. Pregnancy enhances the progression from ASB to symptomatic bacteriuria, which if left untreated, could lead to acute pyelonephritis and other adverse outcomes such as prematurity, postpartum, hypertensive disease, anaemia, UTIs and higher foetal mortality rates. AIM: To identify the prevalence of ASB, the most common causative microorganisms and the antibacterial susceptibilities of the isolated microorganisms at a tertiary care centre at Kanpur, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 300 asymptomatic pregnant women were screened for ASB by urine culture by using a semi quantitative culture method. RESULTS: In this study, significant bacteriuria was found in only 22 cases (7.3%). Growth of contaminants was seen in 40 cases (13.3%). Among cases which showed positive cultures, 48.9% were primigravidae and 51.1% were multigravidae. Highest incidence was reported in age group of 21-30 years. The predominant organisms which were isolated were Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Escherichia coli, the most common isolate, was found to be only 61% and 70% sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate, respectively. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 95%, and sensitivity to amikacin was 99%. Hundred percent sensitivity was found for the broad spectrum pencillins, imipenem, and meropenem. Klebsiella pneumoniae, the second most frequent organism which was grown on culture, was only 11% sensitive to ampicillin, while sensitivity to amoxicillin + clavulanate and cefuroxime was 86%. 100% sensitivity was found for cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSION: Routine urine culture test should be carried out for all antenatal women, to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria, and every positive case should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, to prevent any obstetric complication which is associated with pregnancy.
TI  - Bacteriology and drug susceptibility analysis of pus from patients with severe intra-abdominal infection induced by abdominal trauma.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the bacteriology and  drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal trauma patients with severe intra-abdominal infection (SIAI). A total of 41 patients with SIAI induced by abdominal trauma were enrolled in the study, from which 123 abdominal pus samples were obtained. The results from laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were subjected to susceptibility analysis using WHONET software. A total of 297 strains were isolated in which Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 53.5 (159/297), 44.1 (131/297) and 0.7% (2/297), respectively. Anaerobic bacteria accounted for 1.7%. The five predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). E. coli was highly susceptible to cefoperazone (91%) and imipenem (98%), while Gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). S. aureus was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and K. pneumoniae was highly susceptible to imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). P. aeruginosa was the most susceptible to ciprofloxacin (90%). Gram-negative bacterial infection was present in the majority of cases of SIAI. However, a large number of patients were infected by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly S. aureus that exhibited significant resistance to penicillin (100%), oxacillin (100%) and a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime (95%). Amongst the pathogenic bacteria that cause SIAI, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria account for a high proportion, so high-level and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initially used.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of urinary pathogens in male outpatients in Argentina.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens is important for determining the best treatment option. This study aimed to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial strains isolated from adult male outpatients. METHODOLOGY: Between November 2012 and April 2013, 3,105 community urine samples were analyzed from adult male patients who attended the Laboratorio Hidalgo, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporin were tested for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production using the double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: Of the 3,105 urine samples analyzed, 791 (25.5%) had significant bacteriuria. The frequency of positive urine cultures increased significantly with patient age. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently (47.3%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (13.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%). Gram-negative organisms represented 78.8% of urinary pathogens. The highest activities against Gram-negative bacteria were found with imipenem (99.0%), amikacin (98.1%), ertapenem (94.2%), fosfomycin (90.7%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (90.1%). The frequencies of ESBLs among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were 15.2 %, 22.3%, and 8%, respectively. Fosfomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and nitrofurantoin were most effective against Gram-positive organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Fosfomycin may be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without risk factors, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam is preferred for the treatment of parenchymatous UTIs, complicated UTIs, and UTIs associated with risk factors. To ensure the optimal selection of antibiotics, physicians should have access to up-to-date information about the local prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  - Paenibacterin, produced by Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, is active both against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (ATCC CRL-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)>/=109mug/mL. The cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged Gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. In a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of P. aeruginosa. Considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in Dhaka City, Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. We planned to find out the prevalent microbial strains causing UTI in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Urine sample was collected from 462 UTI suspected female subjects. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. A higher incidence (16.8%) of UTI was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. Escherichia coli (69%), Streptococcus spp. (15%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to Enterococcus faecalis (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and Hafnia alvei (2%). The E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. Isolated strains of E. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. CONCLUSION: The extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. This study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the UTI pathogens to reduce the morbidity of female UTI patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. Antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. We sought to determine an effective antibiotic in PMMA beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. METHODS: PMMA beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. Antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. Beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. RESULTS: Daptomycin alone was not active against K. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). Tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. Meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. The addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. The presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic PMMA beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. The addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. Further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections among patients admitted in the medical and surgical  wards of a non-teaching secondary care hospital in northern India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of Nosocomial Infection (NI) and type of  bacteriological isolates among the patients admitted in the medical and surgical wards of a non-teaching secondary care hospital in north India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional hospital based study conducted in the Wards of General Medicine, General Surgery and Orthopaedic of the hospital. The patient were admitted in the department for various surgical procedures, without evidence of initial infection, were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in the study of which 82 were from Medical and 94 from Surgical ward. Overall incidence of NI was found to be 26.1% (Medical ward=28%, Surgical ward=24.5%., p=0.58). The isolation rate of Acinetobacter baumanii was (p=0.15) higher among the patients of medical ward (95.7%) than surgical ward (82.6). Escherichia coli was isolated in 89.1% and no significant difference was observed between medical and surgical wards. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in 50% patients and was almost similar (p=0.37) in medical surgical wards. The isolation rate of Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci were 43.5%, 73.9%, 34.8% and 17.4% respectively. A significant difference was observed in the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis (p=0.007) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (p=0.002) between medical and surgical wards. Overall, among the patients who developed NI, 27.2% patient's bacterial isolates were Gram positive (Surgical=64.1, Medical=80%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NI is increasing in the hospitals, so extensive that more care has to be taken in cleaning the wards of the hospitals.
TI  - Toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
AB  - Nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. Chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. Because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. Magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. Toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. At concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 McFarland Standard solution of E. coli and per 400 CFU of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis in K. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
TI  - Novel benzoxazoles: synthesis and antibacterial, antifungal, and antitubercular activity against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive microbes.
AB  - A new series of 5-(p-substituted benzamido/phenylacetamido)-2-(p-tert-butylphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and antimycobacterial activities against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as against Candida albicans and Candida krusei. The compounds possessed broad-spectrum activity against all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging between 16-128 microg/ml. One compound exhibited significant antibacterial activity (16 microg/ml) against an antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolate, having twice the potency of the compared standard drugs vancomycin and gentamycin sulfate. The compounds also showed moderate antitubercular activity with MIC values between 8-128 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its clinical isolate.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Etiology of peritonitis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the etiology of peritonitis, as well as the sensitivity of isolated bacteria to antibiotics. METHODS: Study was performed at the Surgical Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Department of Microbiology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology of University Clinical Centre (UCC) Tuzla. In a prospective study, starting from 1.6.2009. to 30.6.2010., was 60 patients analyzed who underwent surgery for acute peritonitis in the Surgical Clinic, UCC Tuzla. RESULTS: After microbiological processing of the content of the operative field, wound swabs and smears of drainage, we isolated Gram positive coccid bacteria: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 18.36%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.6%, while Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecum were found in 3.44% isolates. In the group of Gram-negative bacteria we isolated: Escherichia coli in 15.51%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10.34% of the cases. The sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was largest to vancomycin (100%), and lowest to penicillin (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was largest to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (100%) and lowest to penicillins (3.7%). Sensitivity of the facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli was highest to carbapenems 95-100%, and lowest to penicillin preparations 0-56%. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of microbiological findings of 83.33% patients empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriately involved, and in 16.67% was inadequate and later changed, following the results of microbiological findings. This study indicates the importance and validity of microbiological diagnostics to determine the etiology of peritonitis and appropriate selection of antibiotics to treat these infections, with the required surgical treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  - To date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. As a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) distributions for four common biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on Staphylococcus aureus (N = 1635) and Salmonella spp. (N = 901) but also including Escherichia coli (N = 368), Candida albicans (N = 200), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 60), Enterobacter spp. (N = 54), Enterococcus faecium (N = 53), and Enterococcus faecalis (N = 56). From these data epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) are proposed. As would be expected, MBCs were higher than MICs for all biocides. In most cases both values followed a normal distribution. Bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for Enterobacter chlorhexidine susceptibility (both MICs and MBCs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of Enterobacter (MBC), E. coli (MBC and MIC) and S. aureus (MBC and MIC). There is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. Our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - Characteristics of urinary tract infection pathogens and their in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in China: data from a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the characteristics of pathogens identified in clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) and their in vitro sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics in the clinical setting in China. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter study was conducted between January and December 2011 in 12 hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: Urine samples were collected from 356 symptomatic patients treated in the study hospitals for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent UTI or complicated UTI. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2011 guidelines. Thirteen antimicrobial agents were tested: fosfomycin tromethamine, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, cefdinir, cefixime, cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, azithromycin, nitrofurantoin and oxacillin. Escherichia coli isolates were screened and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) production was confirmed by a double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: 198 urine samples were culture-positive and 175 isolates were included in the final analysis. E coli was detected in 50% of cultures, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). The detection rate of ESBL-producing E coli was 53%. Resistance to levofloxacin was the most common among all the isolates. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin tromethamine had the greatest activity against E coli; overall, 92% and 91% of isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials. E faecalis had the highest susceptibility rates to fosfomycin tromethamine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently identified pathogens in our patients were ESBL-producing E coli and E faecalis. Fosfomycin tromethamine and nitrofurantoin showed a good antimicrobial activity against UTI pathogens. They may represent good options for the empiric treatment of patients with UTI.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteria in human gallstones].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complications caused by lost gallstones within the abdominal cavity are well known. Abscesses, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract were all described in the literature, but gallstones were found in hernial sac, or even in sputum after it penetrated through the diaphragm into the respiratory tract. These complications can develop between several weeks to several years postoperatively. Most complications can be treated surgically only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty gallstones and bile samples were collected from 50 patients who underwent cholecystectomy (36 female / 14 male, avarge age: 60.8 +/- 6.8 years). All samples were sent for microbiological examination. RESULTS: bacterial colonization of the gallstone and the bile were found in 16 cases. Four of them showed acute inflammation in the gallbladder while pathological signs of chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall were detected in eight cases. Empyema was found in four cases. Bacteria from enteral origin (Esherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae) was detected in 13 cases, while non-enteral (Klebsiella penumoniae, Streptococcus alfa-haemoliticus) colony were detected in three cases. Positive bacterial cultures were identified in twelve female and fourmale patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of bacteria can be found in the gallstones, which may cause various complications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - Comparison of bacteria isolated from emergency department patients versus hospitalized patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: The frequencies and corresponding susceptibilities of bacteria isolated  from patients in the emergency department (ED) were compared with those from hospitalized patients. METHODS: A microbiology laboratory report of all positive bacterial cultures obtained in the ED, regardless of the source (e.g., blood, urine, sputum), was obtained. In the case of duplicate cultures, only the first isolate cultured from a single patient was included. Colonization-site cultures (e.g., nasal swabs) and culture reports identified by the laboratory as contaminant organisms were excluded from the evaluation. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were then compiled into a standardized ED-specific antibiogram. Antimicrobial susceptibilities for each pathogen in the ED antibiogram were compared with those in the hospitalwide antibiogram. If there was a difference of >/=5% between the susceptibility of a single antimicrobial agent, chi-square tests were conducted, and unadjusted odds ratios were calculated. Pathogens with fewer than 30 isolates were excluded from the susceptibility comparison. RESULTS: A total of 3140 cultures were evaluated (1417 from the ED, 1723 from the hospital). The frequencies of pathogens isolated in the ED and hospitalwide were similar, with the exception of Escherichia coli, which were more commonly isolated in ED patients, and Enterococcus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were more common in hospitalized patients. Significant differences in susceptibility profiles were identified for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in the frequencies of bacteria isolated and corresponding susceptibilities were found in cultures obtained in ED patients compared with those obtained in hospitalized patients.
TI  - The need for vigilance: false-negative screening for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency caused by deribosylation of urinary biomarkers.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (dADSL) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Biochemical diagnosis of the disease is based on the determination of enormously elevated urinary levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) and succinyladenosine (SAdo). We report a case of false negative screening for dADSL caused by deribosylation of the urinary biomarkers SAICA-riboside and SAdo. DESIGN AND METHODS: A thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method with Pauly reagent detection of SAICA-riboside was used as a screening method. High-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) and LC-MS/MS methods were used for the identification and quantitative determination of SAICA-riboside, SAdo, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide (SAICA) and succinyladenine (SA). RESULTS: Following a negative TLC screening in a known case of dADSL, we analyzed urine using HPLC-DAD. The concentration of SAICA-riboside was 2.7mmol/mol creatinine (below the TLC detection limit), and we detected the two abnormal metabolites identified by LC-MS/MS as SAICA and SA. We showed that SAICA and SA were produced by deribosylation of SAICA-riboside and SAdo in the patient's urine. Studies performed by monitoring the production of SAICA and SA after the addition of SAICA-riboside and SAdo to the patient's urine and to urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections suggested that deribosylation is facilitated by bacterial enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Screening methods for the diagnosis of dADSL may be falsely negative due to bacteria-mediated deribosylation of SAICA-riboside and SAdo. HPLC-DAD or LC-MS/MS analyses allowing for simultaneous detection of SAICA-riboside, SAdo and their deribosylation products SAICA and SA should be preferentially used for the diagnosis of dADSL in urine.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of curcumin: an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration study.
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of curcumin with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method in standard bacterial strains. METHODS: The in vitro antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (ATCC 29213), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 43300), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603) using the macrodilution broth susceptibility test method. After incubation in tubes, the antibacterial activity of curcumin was detected by a lack of turbidity, which indicated the inhibition of bacterial growth. The concentration in the tube with the highest dilution showing no turbidity was defined as the MIC. RESULTS: The curcumin MIC values were 175 microg/ml, 129 microg/ml, 219 microg/ml, 217 microg/ml, 163 microg/ml, 293 microg/ml and 216 microg/ml against P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, MSSA, MRSA, E. coli, E. faecalis and K. Pneumonia, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study revealed antibacterial effects of curcumin against standard bacterial strains in high concentrations. Animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity. There is a need for further in vivo studies to shed light on antibacterial effects of curcumin with high concentrations.
TI  - Emergence of Enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in South Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in South Korea. METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 January 2004 and 31 July 31 2010 were reviewed. Four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. Outcome measures were culture-proven infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in the patients. RESULTS: A total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. The positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). The most common organisms identified were Enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %, 6/96), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). Two cases of Enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. Overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were Gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. The most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of E. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of E. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. This increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants from the cerrado of the centralwestern region of Brazil.
AB  - Ethanol extracts from six selected species from the Cerrado of the Central-Western region of Brazil, which are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, namely Erythroxylum suberosum St. Hil. (Erythroxylaceae), Hyptis crenata Pohl. ex Benth. (Lamiaceae), Roupala brasiliensis Klotz. (Proteaceae), Simarouba versicolor St. Hil. (Simaroubaceae), Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (Sterculiaceae) and Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) March. (Burseraceae), as well as fractions resulting from partition of these crude extracts, were screened in vitro for their antifungal and antibacterial properties. The antimicrobial activities were assessed by the broth microdilution assay against six control fungal strains, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans, and five control Gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Toxicity of the extracts and fractions against Artemia salina was also evaluated in this work. All plants investigated showed antimicrobial properties against at least one microorganism and two species were also significantly toxic to brine shrimp larvae. The results tend to support the traditional use of these plants for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders and/or skin diseases, opening the possibility of finding new antimicrobial agents from these natural sources. Among the species investigated, Hyptis crenata, Erythroxylum suberosum and Roupala brasiliensis were considered the most promising candidates for developing of future bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations.
TI  - Correlations between Income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. This study's hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Income inequality data were obtained from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database. Antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the European antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by Defined daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the European Surveillance of antimicrobial Consumption group. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of: > 0.8 as strong, > 0.5 as moderate and > 0.2 as weak. Confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values. Correlations were calculated for the time period 2003-10, for 15 European countries. RESULTS: Income inequality and antimicrobial resistance correlations which were moderate or strong, with 95% confidence intervals > 0, included the following. Enterococcus faecalis resistance to aminopenicillins, vancomycin and high level gentamicin was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.54 for all three antimicrobials). Escherichia coli resistance to aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was moderately-strongly associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.7 for all four antimicrobials). Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.5 for all three antimicrobials). Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance and income inequality were strongly associated (r=0.87). CONCLUSION: As income inequality increases in European countries so do the rates of antimicrobial resistance for bacteria including E. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings outside Europe and investigate the processes that could causally link income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. Additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. Thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. METHODS: Lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. In this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-AuNCs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. After bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-AuNCs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-AuNC-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. The red emission from the AuNCs on the conjugates could be visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. The bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: We demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-AuNCs and distinguished by the results combining MALDI-MS and PCA. Additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to differentiate E. faecalis from VRE was also demonstrated. The lowest detection concentration for E. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the lysozyme-AuNCs are effective affinity probes for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By combining the results from MALDI-MS and PCA, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. The current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.
TI  - One-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 German hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. To combat multidrug resistant organisms (MRDOs) networks of care providers have been established in all states in Germany. The HICARE-network, a project to combat MRDOs, founded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, German-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the German Society of Hospital Hygiene. The aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation of the situation in 2012. METHOD: The survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in May 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. As in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. Based on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (HA), community-acquired (CA) and lifestock-associated (LA) MRSA), vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA/GRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis resp. Enterococcus faecium (VR-E. faecalis resp. VR-E. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (ESBL) E. coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), multiresistant Acinetobacter spp. (MAB), multiresistant Pseudomonas spp. (MRP), carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as well as Clostridium difficile (CD) infections and severe infections requiring ICU-treatment were included in the survey along with additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. RESULTS: Out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). Data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). The most frequently reported organisms were MRSA 1.53% [CI95: 1.32-1.75], followed by CDAD 1.30% [CI95: 1.11-1.50], ESBL-EC 0.97% [CI95: 0.80-1.14], and ESBL-KP 0.27% [CI95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. Prevalence of MRDOs depended on the level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. Overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical wards compared to surgical wards. All tertiary care providers employed their own infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. Surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. DISCUSSION: With more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over Germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness of the problem of antibacterial resistance in Germany. The prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. Some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. This statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the recombinant antimicrobial peptide Ib-AMP4 from Impatiens balsamina and its synergy with other antimicrobial agents against drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - Ib-AMP4 is an antimicrobial peptide of Impatiens balsamina (Balsaminaceae). Ib-AMP4 was produced as a recombinant peptide and in this study its antimicrobial activity against human bacterial pathogens was investigated. Ib-AMP4 was bactericidal against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with MIC values between 0.49 and 3.5 microM in sensitive species. A genuine synergistic effect was achieved when IB-AMP4 was employed in combination with the plant monoterpene thymol against drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) ATCC700603, or with the antibiotics vancomycin or oxacillin against Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) ATCC51299.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been explored in this setting. AIMS: This study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. METHOD: Glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. Following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rDNA sequencing. Methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, Epsilon tests and PCR. Gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. RESULTS: Total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. Environmental bacteria, particularly Bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. Half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. Enterococcus faecalis , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. Significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. CONCLUSION: Health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. Findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  - Ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Assessment of pathogenic bacteria in treated graywater and irrigated soils.
AB  - Reuse of graywater (GW) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One major impediment for reuse of GW is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. The presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three GW recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. The treated GW and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative PCR. As a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (FW) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. Comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Shigella spp., were found in the treated GW, their corresponding irrigated soils and the FW-irrigated soils. Moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the GW- and FW-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. Our results suggest that GW irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial pathogens from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis conducted by the Japanese surveillance committee during 2009 and 2010: antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
AB  - The Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens responsible for female acute uncomplicated cystitis at 43 hospitals throughout Japan from April 2009 to November 2010. In this study, the causative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents were investigated by isolation and culturing of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 387 strains were isolated from 461 patients, including E. coli (n = 301, 77.8 %), S. saprophyticus (n = 20, 5.2 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 13, 3.4 %), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 11, 2.8 %). S. saprophyticus was significantly more common in premenopausal women (P = 0.00095). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 19 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute manual. At least 87 % of E. coli isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and 100 % of S. saprophyticus isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli strains were 13.3 % and 4.7 %, respectively. It is important to confirm the susceptibility of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empiric antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors. However, the number of isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing strains in gram-negative bacilli may be increasing in patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Japan. Therefore, these data present important information for the proper treatment of UTIs and will serve as a useful reference for future surveillance studies.
TI  - Antibacterial resistance and trend of urinary tract pathogens to commonly used antibiotics in Kashmir Valley.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Increase in resistance pattern of urinary tract pathogens to conventional antimicrobial agents used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is gaining the attention of many microbiologists worldwide in respect to treatment of UTIs. The aim of the present study was to obtain data on resistance patterns of pathogens responsible for UTIs to currently used antimicrobial agents in Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (tertiary healthcare hospital). METHOD: A total of 2842 samples were collected from both outpatient and inpatient departments. The majority of samples in this study were midstream urine specimens, others included catheterized urine samples. Standard parameters were followed for isolation and identification of clinical isolates and further antimicrobial susceptibility test was done by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Out of 2842 samples, 1980 (67%) were culture positive. Escherichia coli (E coli) was the most prevalent isolate (OP 63%, IP 45.5%) followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (K pneumonia) as the second commonest UTI-causing agent (OP 15.9%, IP 21.7%). High percentage of isolates showed resistance to sulfa drugs such as cotrimoxazole. First generation cephalosporins were ineffective, while aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were effective against E coli, K pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P aeruginosa), Enterococcus faecalis and Staphyococcus aureus (Staph aureus). Furthermore, this study noticed that glycopeptide drugs such as vancomycin are highly effective against E faecalis and Staph aureus UTIs. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the increased trend in resistance pattern of uropathogens in the valley region. These data may aid health professionals in choosing the appropriate treatment for patients with UTI in the region and hopefully will prevent the misuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Transplantation-associated long-term immunosuppression promotes oral colonization by potentially opportunistic pathogens without impacting other members of the salivary bacteriome.
AB  - Solid-organ transplant recipients rely on pharmacological immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. The effect of such chronic immunosuppression on the microflora at mucosal surfaces is not known. We evaluated the salivary bacterial microbiome of 20 transplant recipients and 19 nonimmunosuppressed controls via 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Alpha-diversity and global community structure did not differ between transplant and control subjects. However, principal coordinate analysis showed differences in community membership. Taxa more prevalent in transplant subjects included operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of potentially opportunistic Gammaproteobacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Acinetobacter species, Vibrio species, Enterobacteriaceae species, and the genera Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Transplant subjects also had increased proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Enterobacteriaceae species, and Enterococcus faecalis, among other OTUs, while genera with increased proportions included Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus. Furthermore, in transplant subjects, the dose of the immunosuppressant prednisone positively correlated with bacterial richness, while prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil doses positively correlated with the prevalence and proportions of transplant-associated taxa. Correlation network analysis of OTU relative abundance revealed a cluster containing potentially opportunistic pathogens as transplant associated. This cluster positively correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein, suggesting a link between the resident flora at mucosal compartments and systemic inflammation. Network connectivity analysis revealed opportunistic pathogens as highly connected to each other and to common oral commensals, pointing to bacterial interactions that may influence colonization. This work demonstrates that immunosuppression aimed at limiting T-cell-mediated responses creates a more permissive oral environment for potentially opportunistic pathogens without affecting other members of the salivary bacteriome.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides.
AB  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity (MIC) of novel 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides 2 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained in the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium 3-thiolates 1 with sulfonyl chlorides. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 was investigated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum and Gram-negative Escherichia coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains as well as Candida albicans. The investigated compounds exhibited growth-inhibitory activity towards Gram-positive bacteria in the 4-64 microg/mL range whereas that towards Gram-negative bacteria covered the 128-1024 microg/mL range. The highest activity was shown by compound 2c, featuring a phenylsulfonylthio substituent in the 3-quinoline position and a 4-chlorophenylamine group in the position 4. All of the investigated compounds 2 showed antifungal activity in the 32-128 microg/mL range. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - [Efficacy and safety of sitafloxacin in patients with urinary tract infections].
AB  - Sitafloxacin (STFX, Gracevit 50mg, fine granules 10%), a new quinolone antibacterial agent, was approved in January 2008, and the use-results survey was carried out over the 2 years between December 2008 and November 2010. We studied the efficacy and safety of STFX in 1,452 patients with urinary tract infections (cystitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis). The total efficacy rate for urinary tract infections was 91.4% (1,235/1,351 patients). Efficacy rates, classified by the type of infection, were: uncomplicated cystitis 95.9% (466/486 patients), complicated cystitis 87.2% (511/586 patients), uncomplicated pyelonephritis 96.1% (49/51 patients), complicated pyelonephritis 93.5% (145/155 patients), and urethritis 87.7% (64/73 patients). Efficacy rates were 86.0% (49/57 patients) for non-responders to cephems and 77.4% (48/62 patients) for non-responders to quinolones. The eradication rate of indicated strains was 90.5% (545/602 strains). The eradication rates of major causative bacteria were; Escherichia coli 92.7% (294/317 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis 86.0% (43/50 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 66.7% (16/24 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae 95.2% (20/21 isolates), and Chlamydia trachomatis 88.9% (8/9 isolates). The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 2.71% (37/1,365 cases). Major ADRs were diarrhoea (0.88%, 12 cases) and hepatic function disorders (0.51%, 7 cases). A serious ADR (hepatic function abnormality) was observed in 1 case, and the hepatic function in this patient returned to normal after treatment with STFX was discontinued. In conclusion, these results suggest that STFX is a useful antibacterial agent with an efficacy rate of 91.4% against urinary tract infections, with a minimum efficacy rate of 87.2% (against complicated cystitis), and has no serious problems in its safety profile.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Design, synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel benzothiazole analogs.
AB  - In an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. Structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. These compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram+ bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram- bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus). The compound 3e showed maximum potency against all Gram+/gram- bacterial strains with MIC value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (MIC 6.25 mug/ml). However, all compounds were found ineffective against S. boydii (clinical isolate). Further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with MIC value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - In vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in Benin as folk medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracts from Polygonum senegalensis (Polygonaceae) and Pseudocedrela kotschyi (Meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural Benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: Polygonum senegalensis leaves, and Pseudocedrela kotschyi root. METHODS: Hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency on alpha-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Antioxidant activities were assessed using the DPPH, ORAC, FRAP and DCFH-DA (cell based) assay. Finally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using MIC determination on four Gram-positive cocci (Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus), three Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast Candida albicans. RESULTS: Each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. Polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an IC50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an IC50 = 6.8 mug/ml for DPPH scavenging, - 4.5 mumol Fe II/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol Trolox / g DW - for FRAP and ORAC values, respectively. IC50 = 2.3 mug GA / ml for DCFH-DA assay. Concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three Gram negative bacilli: B. subtilis, E. faecalis, S. aureus and the yeast C. albicans at high concentration. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Effectiveness of flexible gastrointestinal endoscope reprocessing.
AB  - The practice of reprocessing endoscopes and its effectiveness was evaluated in 37 services. Contamination of at least 1 endoscope could be identified in 34 (91.6%) of 37 services. Bacteria, fungi, and/or mycobacteria were isolated from 84.6% (33/39) of the colonoscopes (110-32,000 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) and from 80.6% (50/62) of the gastroscopes (100-33,000 CFUs/mL). Not all services followed recommended guidelines. Therefore, patients who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies were exposed to diverse pathogens.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - American Journal of Gastroenterology Lecture: Intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - The vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. Starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. Moreover, vital interactions of the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic CDI, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. In addition, FMT has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-CDI diseases is in its infancy. More work needs to be done with FMT to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. There is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. Future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to cure disease. FMT is but the first step in this journey.
TI  - Using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  - New advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. Rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. These data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. In addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. Tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis,Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Clostridium difficile, and Candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
TI  - Effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. Ozone may have a role in these situations. The objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in Petri dishes. METHODS: A pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. The small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/mL ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. In the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted Petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). The cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of O(3)/mL for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. RESULTS: The selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: Escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. All isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSION: A single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice--an observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guideline recommendations on therapy in urinary tract infections are  based on antibiotic resistance rates. Due to a lack of surveillance data, little is known about resistance rates in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in general practice in Germany. In a prospective observational study, urine cultures of all women presenting with urinary tract infections in general practice were analysed. Resistance rates against antibiotics recommended in German guidelines on UTI are presented. METHODS: In a prospective, multi-center observational study general practitioner included all female patients >/= 18 years with clinically suspected urinary tract infection. Only patients receiving an antibiotic therapy within the last two weeks were excluded. RESULTS: 40 practices recruited 191 female patients (mean age 52 years; range 18-96) with urinary tract infections. Main causative agent was Escherichia coli (79%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (14%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%).Susceptibility of E.coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4,5%; 2,2%. In 17,5%, E.coli was resistant to trimethoprim and in 8,5% to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance rates of uropathogens from unselected patients in general practice differ from routinely collected laboratory data. These results can have an impact on antibiotic prescribing and treatment recommendations.
TI  - Neonatal outcome of preterm infants born to mothers with abnormal genital tract colonisation and chorioamnionitis: a cohort study.
AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesised that abnormal genital tract colonisation leading to an in utero inflammation/infection process, contributes to the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), intra ventricular haemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. METHODS: 396 placentas and umbilical cords of neonates born at 22-32weeks of gestation were evaluated. Genital tract and amniotic fluid swabs were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Chorioamnionitis significantly increases the risk for RDS (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.14-2.65), NEC (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.36-3.28) and ROP>2 (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.33-3.36). But the risk for IVH, PDA and BPD did not differ between the groups. Klebsiella pneumoniae (OR 5.33, 95% CI 1.06-26.79), Staphylococcus sp. (OR 18.39, 95% CI 2.32-145.2) and Enterococcus faecalis (OR 10.7, 95% CI 1.27-89.9) showed a significant relationship with intrauterine inflammation processes. E. faecalis increased the risk for NEC (OR 6.13, 95% CI 1.059-37.6). We did not note a link between ROP and genital tract colonisation. Interestingly PDA seems to be triggered by the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 2.38 95% CI 1.83-3.82). CONCLUSION: Our results show a link between K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus sp., E. faecalis and intrauterine infection. E. faecalis increases the risk for NEC, and suggests a direct link between gram + bacteria, chorioamnionitis and NEC.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (SSI) in Japan.
AB  - To investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (SSI), a Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. Seven main organisms were collected from SSI at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with SSI were included. Staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4 %) and Bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus among S. aureus was 72.0 %. Vancomycin MIC 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. In Escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). Of E. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). No P. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. In P. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4 % to tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), 10.2 % to imipenem (IPM), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and CPFX, and 0 % to gentamicin. In the B. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to TAZ/PIPC and IPM, and 0 % to metronidazole (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0 %). MIC(9)(0) of P. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in TAZ/PIPC, CAZ, IPM, and CPFX. In patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >/=3, the resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to TAZ/PIPC and CAZ were higher than in patients with ASA </=2. The data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause SSI. Timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - [Experience of use of prolit septo in the complex treatment of patients with urolithiasis].
AB  - The efficacy of phytogenic drug prolit septo in the complex treatment of patients with urolithiasis complicated by infectious-inflammatory process was evaluated. The effects of prolit septo were assessed by a comparative evaluation of the results of microbiological analysis of urine in 14 patients of main group and 12 patients of control group. Patients in both groups were matched by sex, age, and results of raiological, clinical, biochemical and microbiological methods of examination. For the treatment of 11 patients of the main group, prolit septo was applied in combination with standard anti-bacterial treatment, 3 patients received monotherapy with prolit septo within 3-6 weeks. The drug was administered at a dose of 1200 mg (2 capsules) 3 times a day. Twelve patients of the control group received only standard treatment. The duration of treatment in both groups was 1-2 weeks. It was found that combined therapy with prolit septo is more effective than standard antibacterial treatment. Against the background of combined therapy the disappearance of bacteriuria was noted in 54.5% of patients of main group compared with 8.3% of patients of control group.
TI  - Species-level analysis of DNA sequence data from the NIH Human Microbiome Project.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emphasize the  importance of surveillance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Genomic sequencing of clinical microbiological specimens expands our capacity to study cultivable, fastidious and uncultivable members of the bacterial community. Herein, we compared the primary data collected by the NIH's Human Microbiome Project (HMP) with published epidemiological surveillance data of Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The HMP's initial dataset contained microbial survey data from five body regions (skin, nares, oral cavity, gut and vagina) of 242 healthy volunteers. A significant component of the HMP dataset was deep sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which contains variable regions enabling taxonomic classification. Since species-level identification is essential in clinical microbiology, we built a reference database and used phylogenetic placement followed by most recent common ancestor classification to look at the species distribution for Staphylococcus, Klebsiella and Enterococcus. MAIN RESULTS: We show that selecting the accurate region of the 16S rRNA gene to sequence is analogous to carefully selecting culture conditions to distinguish closely related bacterial species. Analysis of the HMP data showed that Staphylococcus aureus was present in the nares of 36% of healthy volunteers, consistent with culture-based epidemiological data. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were found less frequently, but across many habitats. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that large 16S rRNA survey studies can be used to support epidemiological goals in the context of an increasing awareness that microbes flourish and compete within a larger bacterial community. This study demonstrates how genomic techniques and information could be critically important to trace microbial evolution and implement hospital infection control.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - The relative importance of Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a urinary tract pathogen: distribution of bacteria among urinary samples analysed during 1 year at a major Swedish laboratory.
AB  - To determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on Staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large Swedish cohort. S. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (UTI) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of UTIs in this patient group being caused by S. saprophyticus. We hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings. During the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the Karolinska University Hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. Patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. The most common pathogens were E. coli (57.0%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), K. pneumoniae (5.9%), group B streptococci (5.7%), P. mirabilis (3.0%) and S. saprophyticus (1.8%). The majority of subjects with S. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of age (63.8%). In this age group, S. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. S. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with E. coli even in this patient group. For women in other ages and for men, growth of S. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.
TI  - Survey on hospital-acquired urinary tract infection in neurological intensive care unit.
AB  - This study aimed to explore the causes, incidence, and risk factors of urinary tract infection patients in neurological intensive care unit (ICU). Patients (n = 916) admitted to the neurological ICU from January 2005 to December 2010 were retrospectively surveyed for urinary tract infections. There were 246 patients in neurological ICU who were diagnosed with hospital-acquired urinary tract infection during that period of time (26.9%). Forty-three cases were upper urinary tract infection, and 203 cases were lower urinary tract infection. The top three strains were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Older age (UTI rate, 22.6%), female patients (21.7%), hospital stay for more than 7 days (16.7%), diabetes (11.7%), and catheterization (21.1%) were the risk factors for hospital-acquired urinary tract infection. There is a high incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infection in the neurological intensive care unit. Active prevention program and surveillance need to be carried out in neurological ICU, especially in those with risk factors.
TI  - [Spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in children with nephrotic  syndrome complicated by urinary tract infection: an analysis of 97 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in 97 children with NS complicated by UTI, who hospitalized from January to December, 2011. RESULTS: The incidence of UTI in children with NS was 36.5%. It was significantly more common in children with recurrent NS than in those with primary NS (44.0% vs 31.9%; P<0.05). These cases mainly presented with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Enterococcus was the most common pathogenic bacteria (50.5%), including Enterococcus faecium (29.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%), followed by Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (15.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.7%). Enterococcus was highly sensitive to nitrofurantoin, vacomycin and linezolid, but was highly resistant to tetracycline and moxifloxacin. More multi-resistant strains were detected in Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (72% vs 17%; P<0.05). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were highly sensitive to amikacin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Of the Gram-negative bacteria, 25% produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs-producing bacteria had 100% sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam but were highly resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Children with recurrent NS are more susceptible to UTI than those with primary NS. Enterococcus is becoming major pathogenic bacteria for UTI in children with NS and has relatively high drug resistance, and most strains of Enterococcus faecium are multi-resistant.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Linum pubescens growing wild in Jordan.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the aerial flowering parts of Linum pubescens were collected by hydro-distillation and analysed by GC and GC/MS. Analysis allowed the identification of 68 components of which, geranyl isovalerate (18.93%), lauric acid (12.07%), germacrene D (10.61%), decanoic acid (8.07%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.02%) and 1-hexanol (4.99%) were detected as major constituents. The isolated essential oil of the plant exhibited high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus ATCC11778, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2923) and showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 13048 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031).
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Polymicrobial peritonitis following colonoscopic polypectomy in a peritoneal dialysis patient.
AB  - Patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) are at an increased risk of peritonitis following colonoscopy with or without polypectomy. Guidelines for peritoneal dialysis patients recommend administration of prophylactic antibiotics and drainage of the abdomen before colonoscopy. In this report, we describe a 53-year-old woman on CAPD who underwent colonoscopy with polypectomy and developed peritonitis within 24 hours. She presented with severe abdominal pain, typical rebounding tenderness, and turbid dialysate containing increased white blood cells with a predominance of neutrophils. A culture of the patient's peritoneal fluid grew polymicrobial species including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. She was treated with intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of combination antibiotics, and she fully recovered within 3 weeks. We suggest that nephrologists and endoscopists should be familiar with the risks and follow the guidelines to prevent such complications in CAPD patients. If peritonitis occurs, medical therapy with antibiotics should be considered before surgical intervention for catheter salvage.
TI  - Evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections versus prophylactic treatment with antibiotics.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered the most common bacterial infections, especially in women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the sublingual bacterial vaccine Uromune(R) in order to prevent recurrent UTIs (RUTIs). METHODS: This study was conceived as a multicenter observational study. The clinical history of 319 women who presented at least 2 episodes of UTI in the last 6 months or 3 in 12 months was reviewed. Data related to treatment and clinical evolution were recorded and analyzed. A total of 159 patients received prophylactic treatment with Uromune(R) for a period of 3 months (group A) and 160 with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 200/40 mg/day for a period of 6 months (group B). Uromune(R) contained an inactivated bacterial cell suspension of selected strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: Patients in group A experienced a highly significant reduction in the number of infections compared to patients in group B. In the first 3 months, the mean number of infections was 0.36 versus 1.60 (P < 0.0001), respectively. A significant reduction was also observed after 9 and 15 months (P < 0.0001). The numbers of patients who did not have any UTI at 3, 9, and 15 months were 101, 90, and 55 in group A versus 9, 4, and 0 in group B (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study favor the use of this bacterial-based therapeutic vaccine as an effective strategy to reduce frequency, duration, severity, and costs of RUTIs.
TI  - Characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of Rubus parvifolius L.
AB  - Rubus parvifolius L. (Rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. In this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of Rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. A uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded 0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of Rp leaves. We found that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Bacillus cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated Rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). Our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in Rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.
TI  - The variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. The evaluation was based on the determined levels of bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. The air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a GilAir 5 (Sensidyne, USA) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (Whatman, UK). For the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. RESULTS: The total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). For Gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). The concentrations of the cocci of Enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other Gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). The lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the buildings). The lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. Gram-positive bacteria of the genera: Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Aerococcus, and Gram-negative bacteria of the genera: Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pasteurella, Pantoea were isolated. It was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). Furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. They should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when the gates in the hen houses are closed.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Kluyvera georgiana strain with the potential for acrylamide biodegradation.
AB  - Worldwide contamination by acrylamide, a neurotoxicant and carcinogen in animals, is becoming a significant problem. We isolated three novel acrylamide-degrading bacteria from domestic wastewater in Chonburi, Thailand. Using biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the strains were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kluyvera georgiana and Enterococcus faecalis. K. georgiana strain No. 2 was selected for further characterization due to its degradation potential of high concentrations of acrylamide at the mesophilic temperatures. The strain grew well in the presence of acrylamide at concentrations to 0.5 % (w/v), pH 5.0 to 7.0 and 37 degrees C. Degradation of acrylamide to acrylic acid began after 30 min of cultivation as a biomass-dependent manner. Mass balance analysis revealed 92.3 % conversion of acrylamide to acrylic acid and two lower polarity compounds. Strain No. 2 degraded many aliphatic amides but not iodoacetamide and thioacetamide. High degradation level (>80 %) was found with propionamide, cyanoacetamide and acetamide. Moderate degradation was obtained in the order of formamide > butyramide > lactamide > urea while sodium azide provided 34 % degradation. These findings render this novel bacterium attractive for biodegradation of acrylamide and other aliphatic amides in the environment.
TI  - Costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in Manhattan. The main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: Controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [CI], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; CI, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; CI, 1.5-5.4). Patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; CI, 0.01-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: With careful matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. The difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.
TI  - Comparison of the WST-8 colorimetric method and the CLSI broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (WST-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the CLSI method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower MICs. The extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent MICs for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (VRE) and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) in the broth microdilution method. There was excellent agreement between the MICs determined after 24h using the WST-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. The results suggest that the WST-8 colorimetric assay is a useful method for rapid determination of consistent MICs for drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin Z.
AB  - The emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. Transvalencin Z (1) is a natural product from Nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. The total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin Z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, HPLC retention times, and optical rotation measurements. Surprisingly, none of the transvalencin Z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.
TI  - Urine flow cytometry as a primary screening method to exclude urinary tract infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: To exclude urinary tract infections, culture is the gold standard method, although it is time consuming and costly. Current strategies using dipstick analysis are unsatisfactory as screening methods, because of inadequate sensitivity/specificity. Urine flow cytometry is an attractive alternative. To exclude urinary tract infections, a cutoff value to screen for negative cultures was determined. METHODS: 281 outpatients (51 % male) of a general population visiting the urology department were included. Urine samples were measured by flow cytometry and compared with culture results and dipstick analysis. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the screening performance of flow cytometry and dipstick analysis compared to culture. RESULTS: 18 % of cultures were positive, defined as >10(4) colony forming units/mL. Bacterial count by flow cytometry alone provides the best sensitivity and specificity to exclude a urinary tract infection. A cutoff value of 60 bacteria/muL urine leads to a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 60 %. Retrospectively, with a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/muL urine, 49 % of the cultures would have been redundant. 20 % of patients receiving antibiotics possibly had received those unnecessarily. The calculated percentage of false negatives was 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-3.3 %). CONCLUSIONS: Urine flow cytometry is a reliable screening method to exclude urinary tract infections. With a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/muL urine, negative predictive value is 100 % and the calculated percentage of false negatives is 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-3.3 %). Using flow cytometry as a screening method could lead to a reduction in cultures and antibiotics.
TI  - Reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  - The on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. Here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The robustness of our approach lies in the novel method for the production of the SER substrate based on silver nanoparticles and their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. The method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial SERS substrates.
TI  - Sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  - We investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. Using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in Japan. Six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). Major causative bacteria detected were Escherichia coli (65.0 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), Streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). From 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were E. coli (61.5 %), E. faecalis (13.7 %), K. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and S. agalactiae (4.0 %). The sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cephems of E. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. In regard to infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [LVFX] >/=4 mug/mL), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of FQ administration within 1 month. Although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. The major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli were a history of FQ administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. It was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of FQ administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
TI  - LiF Reduces MICs of Antibiotics against Clinical Isolates of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (LiF) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with LiF were performed by microdilution method. MICs were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. We observed reduced MICs of antibiotics associated with LiF ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. The strongest decreases of MICs observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with LiF against Acinetobacter baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against S. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against A. baumannii and S. pneumoniae. This suggests that LiF exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of Andhra Pradesh, India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India, through the use of questionnaires. The data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. RESULTS: The consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. These drugs were found to be in high demand. Among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: Escherichia coli (36%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). In terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast United States.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in Northeast United States. METHODS: All vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from January 1988 to December 2008 were included in the study. The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (37.5%, n=60), Viridans Streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). Other common gram-positive isolates include Propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other Streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). The most common gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), Moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and Haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). Vancomycin was effective against all CoNS, Sta. aureus, Viridans Streptococcus, and E. faecalis tested, and all Sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. Of all CoNS isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in resistance (P=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). CoNS showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (P=0.010, P=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (P=0.003, P=0.040, respectively). Susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. CONCLUSION: Bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. The importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacterial activity of Monticalia greenmaniana (Asteraceae).
AB  - The essential oils from fresh aerial parts of Monticalia greenmaniana (Hieron) C. Jeffrey (Asteraceae) collected in March, were analyzed by GC/MS. Oil yields (w/v) of 0.1% (flowers), 0.07%, (stems) and 0.1% (leaves) were obtained by hydrodistillation. Thirteen, sixteen and eighteen components, respectively, were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components of the flower and stem oils were 1-nonane (38.8% flowers; 33.5% stems), alpha-pinene (29.0% flowers; 14.8% stems) and germacrene D (15.6% flowers; 18.6% stems). However, in the leaf oil, germacrene D was observed at 50.7%, followed by beta-cedrene at 8.4%. The leaf essential oil showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the important human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 25955) with MIC values ranging from 75 to 6000 ppm.
TI  - In vitro study of elution kinetics and bio-activity of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement to treat orthopaedic infections continues to remain popular, but resistance to routinely used antibiotics has led to the search for alternative, more effective antibiotics. We studied, in vitro, the elution kinetics and bio-activity of different concentrations of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement. METHODS: Meropenem-loaded bone cement cylinders of different concentrations were serially immersed in normal saline. Elution kinetics was studied by measuring the drug concentration in the eluate, collected at pre-determined intervals, by high-performance liquid chromatography. Bio-activity of the eluate of two different antibiotic concentrations was tested for a period of 3 weeks against each of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2593 (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 43300 (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL). RESULTS: Meropenem elutes from acrylic bone cement for a period of 3-27 days depending on the concentration of antibiotic. Higher doses of antibiotic concentration resulted in greater elution of the antibiotic. The eluate was found to be biologically active against S. aureus ATCC 2593 (MSSA), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, E. coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL) for a period of 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The elution of meropenem is in keeping with typical antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement elution characteristics. The use of high-dose meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement seems to be an attractive option for treatment of resistant Gram-negative orthopaedic infections but needs to be tested in vivo.
TI  - Fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever in adults: emphasizing the evolutionary pre-fatal  clinical and laboratory manifestations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A better description of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is important in alerting clinicians of severe dengue and improving management. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 309 adults with DHF, 10 fatal patients and 299 survivors (controls) were retrospectively analyzed. Regarding causes of fatality, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was found in 4 patients, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone in 2; DSS/subarachnoid hemorrhage, Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia, ventilator associated pneumonia, and massive GI bleeding/Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia each in one. Fatal patients were found to have significantly higher frequencies of early altered consciousness (</=24 h after hospitalization), hypothermia, GI bleeding/massive GI bleeding, DSS, concurrent bacteremia with/without shock, pulmonary edema, renal/hepatic failure, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among those experienced early altered consciousness, massive GI bleeding alone/with uremia/with E. faecalis bacteremia, and K. pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia were each found in one patient. Significantly higher proportion of bandemia from initial (arrival) laboratory data in fatal patients as compared to controls, and higher proportion of pre-fatal leukocytosis and lower pre-fatal platelet count as compared to initial laboratory data of fatal patients were found. Massive GI bleeding (33.3%) and bacteremia (25%) were the major causes of pre-fatal leukocytosis in the deceased patients; 33.3% of the patients with pre-fatal profound thrombocytopenia (<20,000/microL), and 50% of the patients with pre-fatal prothrombin time (PT) prolongation experienced massive GI bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights causes of fatality other than DSS in patients with severe dengue, and suggested hypothermia, leukocytosis and bandemia may be warning signs of severe dengue. Clinicians should be alert to the potential development of massive GI bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and/or leukocytosis. Antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and leukocytosis.

TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - Degradation, mineralization and antibiotic inactivation of amoxicillin by UV-A/TiO(2) photocatalysis.
AB  - The UV-A/TiO(2) photocatalytic decomposition of amoxicillin (AMX) in aqueous suspensions was investigated. Experiments were performed at antibiotic concentrations between 2.5 and 30 mg/L, eight commercially available TiO(2) catalysts at loadings between 100 and 750 mg/L, acidic or near-neutral conditions (pH 5 or 7.5) and two different matrices (ultrapure water and secondary treated effluent) at a photon flux of 8 x 10(-4) E/(L min). Of the various catalysts tested, Degussa P25 was highly active, i.e. complete AMX degradation and 93% mineralization could be achieved after 25 and 90 min of reaction, respectively at 10 mg/L AMX and 250 mg/L titania. In general, mineralization was slower than degradation due to the formation of stable transformation by-products. For the range of concentrations studied, initial degradation rates can be approached by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, while the reaction order with respect to AMX shifts from first to zeroth as initial concentration increases from 2.5 to 5 mg/L to higher values. Degradation in treated effluent was partly impeded compared to pure water due to the inherent presence of organic and inorganic constituents that compete for hydroxyl radicals. Although increasing solution pH from 5 to 7.5 had no effect on degradation, it retarded mineralization. The antibiotic activity of AMX prior to and after photocatalytic degradation was tested to three reference bacterial strains, namely Escherichia coli (ATCC 23716), Klebsiella pneumoniae (NCTC 5056) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 14506). The first two were found to be highly resistant at AMX concentrations up to 25 mg/L, while the latter could partly be inactivated at lower AMX concentrations (i.e. 10 mg/L) and/or in the presence of photocatalytic by-products.
TI  - Chemical compositions of the essential oils of the aerial parts of Chamaemelum mixtum (L.) Alloni.
AB  - The chemical compositions of the aerial parts essential oils of Chamaemelum mixtum (L.) Alloni from Corsica and Sardinia were investigated employing gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The structure of (Z)-heptadeca-9,16-dien-7-one, a natural compound not previously described, was elucidated by GC-MS (electron impact and chemical ionization) and one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The variation in C. mixtum essential oil was studied, and statistical analysis showed the clustering of oil samples into three groups according to the amount of oxygenated compounds; these groups correlated to the harvest area. The strong biological activity of the oxygenated fraction (minimum inhibitory concentration of <0.1 mg/mL) of the Corsican oil against Candida albicans , Citrobacter frendii , Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Listeria monocytogenes , and Staphyllococcus aureus can be attributed to the presence of irregular monoterpene alcohols and (Z)-heptadeca-9,16-dien-7-one.
TI  - Antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of Hypericum scabrum.
AB  - The hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of Hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern Iran, were obtained by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. The hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. The other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid (7.4%). The stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. The hexane extracts of different parts from H. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several Hypericum species. The antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of H. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. The highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an IC50 = 165 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger). The bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. This study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of chinfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chinfloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of chinfloxacin in systemic infection was evaluated in a mouse peritonitis model using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP; n = 1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 2), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSE; n = 1), vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE; n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 1), PRSP (n = 1) and K. pneumoniae (n = 2). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, chinfloxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA [50% effective dose (ED(50)) 2.28-4.15 mg/kg], MRSA (ED(50) 14.75 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) 6.20 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) 3.51-5.03 mg/kg), VSE (ED(50) 25.02 mg/kg), VRE (ED(50) 5.18-15.39 mg/kg), E. coli (ED(50) 1.25-1.90 mg/kg) and K. pneumoniae (ED(50) 2.92-8.28 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of chinfloxacin was generally similar to (P > 0.05) that of moxifloxacin, significantly higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) than that of levofloxacin in Gram-positive isolate infections (MSSA, MRSA, PISP, PRSP, VSE and VRE), and less than that of levofloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae infections (P < 0.01). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, chinfloxacin showed potent activity towards S. pneumoniae (higher than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin and similar to or higher than ciprofloxacin) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of chinfloxacin in vivo. The high efficacy of chinfloxacin in murine systemic and local infections warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - A self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  - This article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against bacteria. The microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of PDMS containing channels that connect the chambers. The assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by PDMS provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. During the operation of the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. The growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a pH indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. Using this device we measured the MIC of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Proteus mirabilis HI4320, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli MG1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. The device provides a simple method for MIC determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. Importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. As the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.
TI  - [The first experience of application of PCR techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  - The results comparison is made between PCR polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. From September to December 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. The blood samples for PCR analysis (SeptiFast technique Roche diagnostics, Switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. Among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. The species structure of identified germs was as follows: Enteroccocus Faecalis - 2, Klebsiella pneumonia - 2, Enteroccocusfaecium - 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative Staphilococcus - 11. All cases of seeding of coagulase negative Staphilococcus were interpreted using PCR techniques as negative or contamination. In four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. In cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the PCR techniques permitted to detect two positive results (Staphilococcus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). In three cases of positive hemoculture the PCR techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. The PCR techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. This techniques has to be applied in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some African medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
AB  - CONTEXT: Plants are known to play a crucial role in African traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in African countries, providing scientific validation for their use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. The highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of Acacia karroo Hayne (Fabaceae) and Anacardium occidentale L. (Anacardiaceae) and the roots of Bridelia cathartica G. Bertol (Euphorbiaceae), against S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 7.5 microg/mL). The same MIC values were exhibited against E. faecalis by the methanol extract of A. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of B. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of Momordica balsamina l. (Curcubitaceae) leaves. Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive; the growth of P. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (MIC = 31 microg/mL) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of Gomphocarpus fruticosus (l.) Ait. (Asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of Trichilia emetica Vahl (Meliaceae) seeds. Most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. Some of them are worthy of further investigation.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - The age-related risk of co-existing meningitis in children with urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine age-stratified rates of co-existing bacterial meningitis in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). The secondary aims of this study were to determine the causative pathogens of UTI, and the clinical features and outcome of children with co-existing meningitis. METHODS: Analysis of data collected over a nine-year period at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Australia. STUDY POPULATION: children below 16 years of age with culture-confirmed UTI and a paired CSF sample. RESULTS: A total of 748 episodes in 735 cases were included in the final analysis. The commonest pathogens causing UTI were Escherichia coli (67.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (3.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Only two (1.2%; 95% CI: 0.15-4.36%) of 163 neonates (between 0 and 28 days of age) with UTI had co-existing meningitis. Both presented with pyrexia, irritability and lethargy, and recovered uneventfully with antibiotic treatment. There were no cases of co-existing meningitis among 499 infants (between 29 days and 12 months of age) with UTI (95% CI: 0.00-0.74%), or any of the 86 children aged 12 months or over (95% CI: 0.00-4.20%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that clinicians should have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture in neonates with UTI, as the risk of co-existing meningitis is not insignificant in this age group. In contrast, beyond the neonatal period, the risk is small and a more selective approach is warranted.
TI  - Role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. METHODS: We performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of NAC. We also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with NAC or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and FITC-labeled concanavalin A. We measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and C. krusei. RESULTS: NAC 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9% reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of NAC ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. Biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in NAC-treated biofilms for all organisms except VRE. The number of non-viable cells in NAC-treated Gram-positive biofilms was increased (p<0.05 for MRSA and VRE). NAC-treated Gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. Fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: NAC is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. NAC has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. SETTING: A long-term care facility in Huntsville, Alabama. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. RESULTS: Results were compiled and reported according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Data. The most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant S. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. This poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. Development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. Implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.
TI  - Composition and antibacterial activity of essential oil from Scutellaria grossa Wall ex Benth.
AB  - The chemical composition of the steam volatile oil of the whole aerial part of Scutellaria grossa Wall ex Benth. (Lamiaceae), obtained by steam distillation, has been analysed by capillary GC and GC-MS. The oil was found to be rich in oxygenated monoterpenes (88.6%). A total of 50 constituents were identified, representing 94.4% of the total oil composition. Linalool (37.0%) and 1-octen-3-ol (32.0%) were found to be the principal constituents. The antibacterial activity of the oil was determined against 10 bacterial strains by measuring the growth inhibitory zones. The oil showed significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and the Gram-negative, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica enterica. A minimum inhibitory concentration of 31.25 microL mL(-1) was observed against E. faecalis.
TI  - DNA, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(II) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
AB  - The coordination propensities of 4(N,N')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (H(2)L(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [PdCl(2)(PPh(3))(2)]. The new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The structure determination of the complexes [Pd(DeaSal-tsc)(PPh(3))] (1), [Pd(DeaSal-mtsc)(PPh(3))] (2) and [Pd(DeaSal-etsc)(PPh(3))] (3) by X-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ONS donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. The binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. The protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. As determined by MTT assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (A549) and liver cancer cells (HepG2). LDH, NO assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. Further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MIC50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
TI  - Comparative study of antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of methanolic and aqueous extracts of the fruit of Emblica officinalis against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antimicrobial potential of aqueous (infusions, decoctions) and methanlic extracts (1:2 and 1:5 concentrations) of Emblica officinalis (amla) against seven pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcs aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus cloacae, Proteus vulgaris and Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: The well diffusion technique was employed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using micro-broth dilution methods and phytochemical screening was done as per standard procedures. RESULTS: Aqueous infusion extract of amla exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against E. cloacae followed by E. coli. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of E. officinalis aqueous extracts (infusions and decoctions) only showed presence of tannins, saponins, flavanoids, Terpenoids and phenols. MIC of aqueous extract of E. officinalis was most active against K. pneumoniae. Whereas MIC of methanol extract of E. officinalis shows maximum activity against E. coli. CONCLUSION: Emblica officinalis definitely possesses potent antimicrobial activities and this can serve as an important platform for the development of inexpensive, safe and effective medicines
TI  - Predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Bacteraemia in the elderly is a difficult diagnosis and a therapeutic challenge due to age-related vicissitudes and to their comorbidities. The main purpose of the study was to assess independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality among the elderly with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine Ward. METHODS: Overall, a cohort of 135 patients, 65 years of age and older, with bacteraemia were retrospectively studied. Data related to demographic information, comorbidities, clinical parameters on admission, source and type of infection, microorganism isolated in the blood culture, laboratory data and empirical antibiotic treatment was recorded from each patient. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of these 135 patients, 45.9% were women. The most common infections in this group of patients were urinary tract infections (46.7%). The main microorganisms isolated in the blood cultures were Escherichia coli (14.9%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (12.0%), non-MRSA (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (8.0%). The in-hospital mortality was 22.2%. Independent prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age >/= 85 years, chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and cognitive impairment at admission (OR, 2.812 [95% CI, 1.039-7.611; p = 0.042]; OR, 6.179 [95% CI, 1.840-20.748; p = 0.003]; OR, 8.673 [95% CI, 1.557-48.311; p = 0.014] and OR, 3.621 [95% CI, 1.226-10.695; p = 0.020], respectively). By multivariate analysis appropriate antibiotic therapy was not associated with lower odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacteraemia in the elderly has a high mortality rate. There are no set of signs or clinical features that can predict bacteraemia in the elderly. However, older age (>/= 85 years), chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and severe cognitive impairment adversely affects the outcome of elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine ward.
TI  - The revival of fosfomycin.
AB  - Fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in Spain in 1969. There are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. Fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. It has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is highly active against Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus, and against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. Fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. Further randomized controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to MDR pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis, antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluation of simple aromatic esters of  ferulic acid.
AB  - Aromatic ester derivatives of ferulic acid where the phenolic hydroxyl is free (6a-d) or acetylated (5a-d) were evaluated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The superoxide radical scavenging capacity of compounds 5d and 6d-e (IC(50) of 0.19, 0.27 and 0.20 mM, respectively) was found to be twice as active as alpha-tocopherol (IC(50) = 0.51 mM). DPPH radical scavenging capacity was moderate and only found in compounds bearing free phenolic hydroxyl groups (6a-e). With regard to antimicrobial properties, compounds 6b and 6c displayed significant activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs = 16 mug/mL) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC for 6b, 32 and for 6c, 16 mug/mL). Compound 6c also demonstrated prominent activity against planktonic Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC value of <8 mug/mL and it inhibited bacterial biofilm formation by S. aureus with a MBEC value of <8 mug/mL, which was 64 and 128 times more potent than ofloxacin and vancomycin, respectively.
TI  - Bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via PTBD.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. METHODS: A total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period July 2003 to September 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. Among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). RESULTS: A total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). Further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174 of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. No anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. The most common microorganisms were Enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), Escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), Enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and Enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). The percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). The percentage of enzyme-producing Escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). CONCLUSION: The bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the Tokyo Guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. Thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic properties and antipathogenic activity of new thiourea derivatives.
AB  - A number of acylthioureas, 2-((4-methylphenoxy)methyl)-N-(aryl-carbamothioyl)benzamides (aryl = 3,5-dichlorophenyl, 2,3-dichlorophenyl, 3,4-dichloro-phenyl, 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 3,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 2-bromophenyl, 2,4-dibromophenyl, 2,5-dibromophenyl, 2-iodophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, 2,3,4-trifluorophenyl, 2,4,5-trifluoro-phenyl, 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl) have been synthesized, characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR spectroscopy and tested for their interaction with bacterial cells in free and adherent state. The anti-pathogenic activity was correlated with the presence of one iodine, bromide or fluorine, and two or three chloride atoms on the N-phenyl substituent of the thiourea moiety, being significant especially on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus strains, known for their ability to grow in biofilms. Our results demonstrate the potential of these derivatives for further development of novel anti-microbial agents with antibiofilm properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological activities of five medicinal plant species from Cameroon traditional medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multiresistant microbial strains are on the increase. Fighting these diseases with natural products may be more efficacious. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and hexanic fractions of five Cameroonian medicinal plants (Piptadeniastum africana, Cissus aralioides, Hileria latifolia, Phyllanthus muellerianus and Gladiolus gregasius) against 10 pathogenic microorganisms of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts. METHODS: The fractions were screened for their chemical composition and in vivo acute toxicity was carried out on the most active extracts in order to assess their inhibitory selectivity. The agar well-diffusion and the micro dilution methods were used for the determination of the inhibition diameters (ID) and Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively on 8 bacterial species including two Gram positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and six Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi) and two fungal isolates (Candida albicans, Candida krusei). The chemical composition was done according to Harbone (1976), the acute toxicity evaluation according to WHO protocol and the hepatic as well as serum parameters measured to assess liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The chemical components of each plant's extract varied according to the solvent used, and they were found to contain alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpens, sterols, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The methanolic and ethylacetate extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastum africana presented the highest antimicrobial activities against all tested microorganisms with ID varying from 8 to 26 mm and MIC from 2.5 to 0.31 mg/ml. The in vivo acute toxicity study carried out on the methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastrum africana indicated that these two plants were not toxic. At the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, kidney and liver function tests indicated that these two medicinal plants induced no adverse effect on these organs. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, all these plant's extracts can be used as antimicrobial phytomedicines which can be therapeutically used against infections caused by multiresistant agents.

Twenty-three compounds (94.5% of the sample) were identified of which the three major ones (76% of the sample) were beta-phellandrene (38.1%), germacrene D (26.8%) and beta-pinene (11.5%). The essential oil showed a broad spectrum of activity against Salmonella Typhi CDC 57 (100 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (200 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (250 microg/mL), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 y Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357 (500 microg/mL). This is the first report on the composition and activity of the essential oil of this species.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Lantana camara var. moritziana.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the leaves of Lantana camara var. moritziana (Otto & Dietr.) Lopez-Palacios collected at Rubio, Tachira State, Venezuela, was obtained by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger trap (0.1% yield). The oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on HP GC-MS System, model 5973, identifying 33 compounds (97.1%) of which the major components were germacrene D (31.0%), followed by beta-caryophyllene (14.8%), a-phellandrene (6.7%), limonene (5.7%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%). Evaluation of the antibacterial activity by agar diffusion method with discs against international reference bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed growing inhibition of E. faecalis and S. aureus at MIC of 350 mg/mL and 400 mg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - Essential oil from aerial parts of of Betonica grandiflora Willd. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of Betonica grandiflora Willd., growing wild in Iran, was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the first time. Overall, 40 volatile components were identified on the basis of their mass spectra characteristics and retention indices in which ledol (21.8%), myrtenyl acetate (21.7%), eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol (6.5%), trans-caryophyllene (5.5%), alpha-bisabolol (4.9%) and isolongifolol (4.5%) were the major constituents. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes, monoterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main groups of compounds with 45.6%, 23.1% and 18.4%, respectively. The oil was moderately active against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and inactive against Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on tyramine (TYR) and also other biogenic amines (BA) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (FBP) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) was investigated by using a rapid HPLC method. Significant differences were observed among the FBP strains in ammonia (AMN) and BA production apart from tryptamine, histamine (HIS) and spermine formation (p<0.05). Salmonella paratyphi A was characterised as the main amine producer. LAB had an important synergetic role in some BA production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some LAB strains on BA production was strain-dependent. Lactococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher TYR accumulation by Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus faecalis in TDB. The presence of Lactococcus and/or Lactobacillus in TDB significantly increased HIS production by A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas HIS accumulation was significantly reduced by Staphylococcus aureus, S. paratyphi A and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Detection of volatile compounds produced by microbial growth in urine by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).
AB  - Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry has been used to measure the volatile compounds occurring in the headspace of urine samples inoculated with common urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing microbes Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans. This technique has the potential to offer rapid and simple diagnosis of the causative agent of UTIs.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacteral activity of Vismia baccifera fruits collected from Merida, Venezuela.
AB  - The essential oil from the fruits of Vismia baccifera Triana & Planch. (Gutttiferae), collected in June 2009, was analyzed by GC/MS. A yield of 0.6% oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Twenty-seven components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components were trans-cadin-l1,4-diene (36.6%), cis-cadin-1,4-diene (18.8%) and beta-caryophyllene (11.9%). The essential oil showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the important human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25992), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 23357) with MIC values ranging from 9 to 37 microg/mL.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - The challenges of antimicrobial resistance in Brazil.
AB  - Brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. Despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic Brazilian clone. Local resistance to vancomycin in Enterococci was first related to Enterococcus faecalis, which differs from European and American epidemiology. Also, local Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). Carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group is becoming a major problem, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. Among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to SPM-1 (Pseudomonasaeruginosa) and OXA-23 (Acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. Local actions without loosing the global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens in a selected stretch of Bay of Bengal, India.
AB  - The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative isolates. This study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis with elevated MICs. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). No streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased MICs (defined as an increase in MIC of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. Ceftaroline MICs for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive H. influenzae with a mutation in L22. One H. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline MIC (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. The ceftaroline MIC for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. MICs for S. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. No S. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased MIC (>4-fold) after 50 passages. Two E. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline MICs increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32 mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. The parental ceftaroline MIC for the one K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.
TI  - Thrombocytes are effectors of the innate immune system releasing human beta defensin-3.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombocyte concentrate i.e. platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a  popular adjunct for many surgical procedures. It is believed to improve bone and soft tissue healing. Recently antimicrobial effects of the autologous preparation were reported by several groups. In this study we investigated the antimicrobial effect of PRP against gram-negative microbes which frequently cause severe complications in orthopaedic trauma surgery. METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma was produced from liquid preserved thrombocyte concentrates. ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were preformed to investigate the release and content of platelet concentrates. A radial diffusion assay was used to detect antimicrobial effects of PRP. RESULTS: We detected the human beta defensin-3 in bactericidal concentrations in platelet preparations by ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In antimicrobial testing we demonstrated effective inhibition of Escherichia coli (ATCC 11303), Bacterium megaterium (ATCC 14581), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Proteus mirabilis (ATCC21100). CONCLUSION: With this study we demonstrate antimicrobial action of a popular adjunct for orthopaedic and trauma surgery against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We have identified a possible mechanism of action via the secretion of HBD-3 as a first line defence in contaminated wounds and in elective application of PRP. This finding supports a broader spectrum of clinical indications for an autologous platelet preparation.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. Ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. Agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. Then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. Further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against Porphyromonas gingivalis. This result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. Only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans) survived in part. Addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. The bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included A. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. In conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. Ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Synthesis of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives as potential anti-microbial and  cytotoxic agents.
AB  - A series of novel 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl)-N-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-thiazolidin-3yl)-acetamide 5a-j have been synthesized from various aldehydes and 2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1H-benzimidazole 6a-j from various benzoic acids. These compounds were screened for their in-vitro anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as Gram positive, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli as Gram negative bacterial strains and for in-vitro anti-fungal activity against Asperigillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The in vitro cytotoxic properties were studied using brine shrimp bioassay. Results revealed that, compounds 5b, 5d, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6e, 6f, and 6i showed excellent activity against a panel of microorganisms. The cytotoxic activities of 5b, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6f, 6h, and 6i were found to be good. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and MS.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - The nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.
AB  - This study was conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout Japan between January 2008 and June 2008. A total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. The strains investigated in this study are as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), Escherichia coli (n = 255), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), Proteus mirabilis (n = 42), Serratia marcescens (n = 44), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) manual. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Although a majority of the E. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and S. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. The proportions of E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%, and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. These data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections: results  from the Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.
AB  - The Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System was established and the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial uropathogens was conducted during the period from January 2008 to June 2009. With the cooperation of 34 medical centers throughout South Korea, a total of 1994 strains belonging to clinically relevant bacterial uropathogens were collected from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). To compare with past data, understand a trend of antimicrobial resistance, and ultimately determine new regimens for empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against Escherichia coli in uncomplicated cystitis to commonly prescribed drugs were investigated. In uncomplicated cystitis, the most prevalent causative organism was E. coli (72.7%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (10.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis, 38.5% were susceptible to ampicillin, 80.7% to amoxicillin/clavulanate, 67.3% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 74.6% to ciprofloxacin, 77.5% to levofloxacin, 86.0% to cefazolin, 86.1% to cefuroxime, 93.6% to cefpodoxime, 94.7% to ceftriaxone, 99.5% to amikacin, 80.9% to tobramycin, and 76.6% to gentamicin. An increasing tendency of resistance to ciprofloxacin (24.8%) has been observed compared with the similar studies in 2006 (23.4%) and 2002 (15.2%) from patients with uncomplicated cystitis. These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired UTIs in South Korea and will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies.
TI  - [Antimicrobial potential of Metarhizium taii in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial potential of Metarhizium tail and its corresponding active fractions. METHODS: The agar diffusion method and growth-rate assay were employed individually to measure the antibacterial and antifungal activities of M. taii. The microdilution and disk colony count was used to test the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bacterial concentration. RESULTS: The extraction fractions of M. tail could evidently inhibi the growth of Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aerzginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis,and phytopathogenic fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, hereby M. taii had a broad spectrum antimicrobial effect including potent antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antimicrobial active ingredients of M. tail mainly existed in three extraction fractions including ethyl acetate extract in fermented broth, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts in mycelia. However there was an evident discrepancy on the antibacterial spectrum and competence for different active extraction fractions. CONCLUSION: M. taii possess potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential, and it is a good edible and medicinal resource for the functional food development and the discovery of new antimicrobial drug.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of single aroma compounds.
AB  - Commercially available aroma samples were evaluated for their olfactory quality by professional perfumers and tested for their antimicrobial activity. Agar diffusion and agar-dilution were used as test methods and a set of two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and four Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris G, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella abony) and a yeast, Candida albicans, were the test microorganisms. All the investigated compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria, especially beta-caryophyllene against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 6 ppm), but only few substances showed activity towards Gram-negative bacteria, except for cinnamic acid, which was active against all (MIC 60 ppm) and Candida albicans, against which cinnamic acid and caryophyllene oxide showed high activity (MIC < 60 ppm).
TI  - [Etiology and sensitivity of uropathogens identified in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women (ARESC Study): implications on empiric therapy].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology and susceptibility of uropathogens identified in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter study (ARESC) in 9 Spanish hospitals, 803 female patients with uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and evaluated to identify the uropathogens and their susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials. RESULTS: Of 803 patients with uncomplicated cystitis, 784 patients were included. A positive urine culture was found in 87.7% of the samples. Of the 650 pathogens isolated, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the most frequent (79.2%) followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), Proteus mirabilis (4.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.3%). E. coli showed a high rate of susceptibility to phosphomycin (97.2%), nitrofurantoin (94.1%) and somewhat lower to ciprofloxacin (88.1%). Fluorquinolone resistance rates were higher among postmenopausal women (17 versus 10%). E. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (65%) and cotrimoxazole (34%) and 25% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanalic acid and cefuroxime. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, E. coli shows high resistance rates to widely used antimicrobial antibiotics. Phosphomycin and nitrofurantoin have a high in vitro activity. Taking into account practical aspects such as convenience (only one dose), and the influence of the amount of fluorquinolone use on enterobacteriaceae and other microorganisms resistance levels, phosphomycin trometamol represents the option of first choice for the empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.
TI  - Leaves Antimicrobial Activity of Glycyrrhiza glabra L.
AB  - Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) is an important medicinal plant. In this study,  the antimicrobial activities of ethanolic and aqueous extracts from licorice leaves were studied compared to root extracts activities. Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans were used as test organisms. Antimicrobial activity was tested by paper disc agar diffusion and serial dilution methods in order to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The root and leave extracts showed activity against Candida albicans, and tested gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The ethanolic extract of the leaves was the most active extract against gram-positive bacteria. Its effectiveness against strains provides hope that it can serve as an alternative therapeutic agent.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel C8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n=1), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, n=1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP, n=1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, n=2), Enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE) and Escherichia coli (n=3). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by PRSP (n=1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending urinary tract infection caused by E. coli (n=1). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA (ED(50) =2.08 mg/kg), MRSA (ED(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant MRSC (ED(50) =2.52 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) =5.47 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and E. coli (ED(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards E. faecalis infection (ED(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by Gram-positive isolates (MSSA, MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PISP, PRSP and E. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against E. coli infection (P<0.01). Nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with Gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ED(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the MIC data (4- to 16-fold MIC advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards PRSP (higher than levofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. In the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against E. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. The higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by Gram-positive cocci (especially MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PRSP and VRE) warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  - The objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  Lactobacillus spp. (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. Four types of beads, containing entrapped (E), surface and entrapped (ES), surface (S) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (C(ES)) were prepared and physically characterized. The antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization, freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. Multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, VIM-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and CTX-M-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. Alginate beads in which lactobacilli proliferated to the beads surface (ES and C(ES)) differed significantly from the other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. Lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both Gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. Beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (ES) resulted in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. The viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.
TI  - Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. Especially, in the United States, silver-containing dressings, such as Acticoat and Aquacel are frequently used. Because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. In previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix as an antiseptic dressing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus Acticoat and Aquacel. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The efficiency was superior to that of Acicoat and Aquacel. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion, that the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Chemical composition of fatty acid and unsaponifiable fractions of leaves, stems  and roots of Arbutus unedo and in vitro antimicrobial activity of unsaponifiable extracts.
AB  - The chemical composition of the fatty acid and unsaponifiable fractions of the leaves, stems and roots of Arbutus unedo L. were determined using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The fatty acid fractions of the leaves, stems and roots contained 38.5%, 31.3% and 14.1% palmitic acid, respectively, along with other long-chain fatty acids (up to C22). The chemical composition of the unsaponifiable fractions differed: the leaf and stem fractions contained high levels of aliphatic (32.1% and 62.6%, respectively) and terpenic compounds (49.6% and 25.7%, respectively), and the root fraction mainly contained esters, of which the most abundant was benzyl cinnamate (36.6%). The antimicrobial activities of the unsaponifiable fractions against nine species of microorganisms were assessed. The unsaponifiable leaf and stem extracts inhibited the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega].
AB  - The urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. Urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. From February 2008 to January 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. From these cultures 1037 were positive. From this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. In bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. It was verified that the most frequent microorganism was Escherichia coli, followed by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that Escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. Proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. For Klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and Enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. In conclusion, this study shows that Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. Therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. A periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - [Investigation of the in vitro antibacterial effects of statins].
AB  - It was previously shown that statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant effects. This study was aimed to investigate the in-vitro antibacterial effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. In this study antibacterial activity of the statins were tested against 16 methicillin-susceptible Stophylococcus aureus (MSSA), 16 methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA), 16 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS), 9 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 7 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecolis, 13 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 16 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Acinetobacter boumannii, 15 ESBL positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Stenotrophomonas maltophilio by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) performance and interpretive guidelines. S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, K.pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 35218 were tested as control strains. The results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for all isolates were > 128 microg/ml for the two statins tested. However, MIC of simvastatin was 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 and was 64 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and was > 128 microg/ml for others, but MIC of atorvastatin was > 128 microg/mI for all standard strains. According to these results, we observed that simvastatin and atorvastain had no significant antibacterial effect in vitro. In this study, although no antibacterial effect of statins were determined in vitro, further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of statins with antibacterial agents in the living organism.
TI  - [Characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. To assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients, in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. Of these, 106 came from patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. The sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using ROC curves. RESULTS: Positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. Within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (MMC) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). The microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was Escherichia coli, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. In the ICU subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was Enterococcus faecalis, followed by Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. Specificity was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the ICU group. The groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with MMC and spinal cord injuries. Sensitivity and specificity (as measured using ROC curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Medicinal Plants Against Pathogens causing Complicated  Urinary Tract Infections.
AB  - Seventeen Indian folklore medicinal plants were investigated to evaluate antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanol and acetone extracts against 66 multidrug resistant isolates of major urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis) by disc diffusion method. Ethanol extract of Zingiber officinale and Punica granatum showed strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Ethanol extracts of Terminalia chebula and Ocimum sanctum exhibited antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ethanol extract of Cinnamomum cassia showed maximum antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa while ethanol extract of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis. The results support the folkloric use of these plants in the treatment of urinary tract infections by the tribals of Mahakoshal region of central India.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric UTIs.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toluidine blue (TB), methylene blue (MB), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical UTI-implicated pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm LED-illuminated conditions. TB and MB were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with the other compounds. Trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except Pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ALA required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: TB and MB were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. The photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.
TI  - [Chronic abdominal aortic graft infection : Detection with 18F-FDG-PET/CT].
AB  - A 67-year-old male patient presented with recurrent fever and septic emboli due to an aorto-duodenal fistula after previous aortobiiliac bypass grafting with suspected graft infection. Imaging by ultrasound, computed tomography scan (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not confirm graft infection. A scan using 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-[18F]-d-glucose positron emission tomography CT (18F-FDG-PET/CT) revealed a pathological uptake. The bifurcated graft was removed und revascularization was performed by axillobifemoral bypass grafting. The clinical role of CT scanning with 18F-FDG-PET/CT is discussed including a review of the recent literature.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Detection of Leptospira in urine using anti-Leptospira-coated gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Serological assays for antibody detection have been widely used for Leptospirosis diagnosis. However, antibody is usually undetectable during the first week after infection. Detection of Leptospira DNA can be done by PCR but this technique requires special equipments and the cost is still relatively high. Here we demonstrate that gold nanoparticles can be used to facilitate Leptospira detection. Gold nanoparticles were coated with rabbit antibody specific to Leptospira interrogans serovar Bratislava and these coated particles were used to detect Leptospira in urine. Agglutination of gold particles indicated the presence of Leptospira in samples tested. The sensitivity of detection was 10 leptospires/ml. No agglutination was observed when anti-Leptospira-coated particles were tested with urine containing the organisms commonly found in urine such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. This assay is very easy to perform and results could be observed with the naked eyes. Fresh or frozen urine samples could be used. The stability of antibody-coated particles was at least 2 months when kept at 4 degrees C. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the technique using antibody-coated gold nanoparticles is a promising tool for further validation as a rapid assay for Leptospirosis diagnosis.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Monticalia andicola (Asteraceae) collected in Venezuela.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Monticalia andicola Turcz., collected in November 2008, was analyzed by GC/MS. A yield of 0.15% oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Thirty-six components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components were alpha-pinene (19.6%), beta-pinene (10.5%), alpha-longipinene (6.5%), delta-3-carene (6.2%), cyperene (5.4%) and beta-phellandrene (5.2%). The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against Gram- positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25992, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) bacteria, using the disc diffusion agar method. The results showed a broad spectrum of activity with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 10 to 150 microg/mL.
TI  - Impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. METHODS: In January 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (ICU). Prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) drainage. The effect on the antibiotic use density (AD: DDD [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (January 2002-December 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(January 2004-December 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. Resistance proportions(RP) and resistance densities (RD), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or E. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3GC) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the Fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Total antibiotic use by 147 DDD/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 DDD/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887DDD/1,000 pd post-intervention. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. The reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. The RR and RD of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli increased after January 2004, whereas the percentage of MRSA significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. It would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical ICUs may be very worthwhile.
TI  - C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiology in late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Fungal infections are increasingly frequent causes of neonatal sepsis (NS). This  study examined the predictive value of the combined evaluation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiologies in patients with NS. From January to September 2007, neonates who were diagnosed with NS and had their CRP and IL-6 levels measured were selected. Based on their blood culture results, the neonates were divided into two groups: group of fungal sepsis (FS) and group of bacterial sepsis (BS). FS included 14 Candida albicans and one non-albicans Candida isolates and BS included five Klebsiella pneumoniae, three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three Enterococcus faecalis, two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, one Enterococcus faecium and one Acinetobacter species. Significant differences were observed in the CRP (FS vs. BS: 28.10 +/- 11.03 vs. 11.39 +/- 2.94 mg l(-1), P = 0.026) and IL-6 (FS vs. BS: 38.60 +/- 24.24 vs. 392.82 +/- 102.46 ng l(-1), P = 0.000) levels between groups. The combined evaluation of the CRP and IL-6 responses better predicted the causative micro-organism in NS.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis (L), Quercus infectoria (Oliver) and Canthium parviflorum (Lam).
AB  - The present study aimed at evaluating the antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis, L., (Rutaceae), Quercus infectoria Oliver., (Fagaceae) and Canthium parviflorum Lam., (Rubiaceae) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytocoa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The experiment was carried out using disc diffusion method. The results revealed that the methanol extract of aerial parts of Ruta chalepensis (L) presented the highest zone of inhibition against tested pathogens. Other plants showed significant zone of inhibition.
TI  - Is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. Approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. These exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. The association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study during 24 months. SETTING: Eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. PATIENTS: All inpatients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary isolates of six indicator organisms (Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant S. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. Indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. Surveillance of nosocomial infection rates was performed according to the German nosocomial infection surveillance system, Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System. Transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate Spearman's rank-correlation test. During 100,781 patient days, 100,829 microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. Altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6 transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. Correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration of hospitalization, or device use. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. Other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of Mexico.
AB  - Traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. Obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. In this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast Mexico. The dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. Each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. The extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), three Gram-positive bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and two Staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a DPPH free radical assay. No activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). We report here for the first time activity of Ceanothus coeruleus against S. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 125 mug ml(-1)), C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and C. parapsilosis (MICs between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); Chrysanctinia mexicana against C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)); Colubrina greggii against E. faecalis (MICs 250 mug ml(-1)) and Cordia boissieri against C. glabrata (MIC 125 mug ml(-1)). Furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from Ceanothus coeruleus, Chrysanctinia mexicana, Colubrina greggii and Cyperus alternifolius. Some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species Ceanothus coeruleus, Schinus molle, Colubrina greggii and Cordia boissieri.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea from the Venezuelan Andes.
AB  - The essential oil of Cordia verbenacea D.C. (Boraginaceae) that grows in Merida-Venezuela was obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of the plant, yielding 0.21%. The oil was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Thirty one components which made up 94.3% of the oil were identified. The most abundant constituents found were: tricyclene (23.9%), bicyclogermacrene (11.7%), germacrene D (9.9%) and beta-caryophyllene (8.2%). Antibacterial activity determination was carried out according to the disc diffusion assay. Activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 170 microg/mL and 200 microg/mL, was found.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of tebipenem against various clinical isolates from various specimen, mainly urinary tract].
AB  - Tebipenem is the active metabolite of ME1211, tebipenem pivoxil, a novel oral carbapenem that possesses potent activity against almost pathogens except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we compared the susceptibility of tebipenem with current antibiotics against various organisms isolated from various specimen, mainly urinary tract. Tebipenem had a potent activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae; its activity was comparable to it of cefixime that has most potent activity among oral antibiotics. Against Enterococcus faecalis, the activity of tebipenem was comparable to the activities of ampicillin and amoxicillin, and superior to it of faropenem. Against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, tebipenem had a potent activity with or without ceftazidime-resistance.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of vertilmicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
AB  - Vertilmicin is a novel aminoglycoside antibiotic with potent activity against gram-negative and -positive bacteria in vitro. In this study, we further evaluated the efficacy of vertilmicin in vivo in systemic and local infection animal models. We demonstrated that vertilmicin had relatively high and broad-spectrum activities against mouse systemic infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The 50% effective doses of subcutaneously administered vertilmicin were 0.63 to 0.82 mg/kg, 0.18 to 0.29 mg/kg, 0.25 to 0.99 mg/kg, and 4.35 to 7.11 mg/kg against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. faecalis infections, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of vertilmicin was generally similar to that of netimicin, better than that of gentamicin in all the isolates tested, and better than that of verdamicin against E. coli 9612 and E. faecalis HH22 infections. The therapeutic efficacy of vertilmicin was further confirmed in local infection models of rabbit skin burn infection and mouse ascending urinary tract infection.
TI  - Uropathogen interaction with the surface of urological stents using different surface properties.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ureteral stents commonly become infected or encrusted. Various coatings  have been developed to decrease bacterial adherence. To our knowledge there has been no in vitro testing of coating with heparin to date. We determined the effects of heparin coating on bacterial adherence of common uropathogens and physical stent properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heparin coated Radiance ureteral stents (Cook) and noncoated Endo-Sof control stents were tested against triclosan eluting Triumph(R) stents and noneluting Polaris control stents for adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 7 days. Adherent bacteria were determined and biofilms were visualized using fluorescent dyes. Radial, tensile and coil strength of the Radiance and Polaris stents was compared to determine the effect of heparin coating on physical stent characteristics. RESULTS: Heparin coating did not decrease bacterial adhesion compared to its control. E. coli adhesion was limited by all stents tested. The Polaris stent showed significantly greater resistance to bacterial adherence for Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterococcus than the Endo-Sof and Radiance stents but was more susceptible to S. aureus adherence. The Triumph stent resisted all bacteria except Pseudomonas and Enterococcus. Mature biofilms were observed on all stents with lower viability on the Triumph stent. Radiance stents showed higher tensile and lower compression strength than its control. CONCLUSIONS: Heparin coating does not decrease bacterial adherence to ureteral stents. Drug eluting antimicrobials have an inhibitory effect on bacterial adherence and the Polaris stent showed the least bacterial adherence of the nondrug eluting ureteral stents tested.
TI  - Molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. STUDY DESIGN: We isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed infants, identified using PCR with species-specific primers, strain-specific Automated Ribotyping and the API-50E kit for Enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. RESULTS: Coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. The counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for E. coli: median 6.30 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. Coliform bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. Our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.
TI  - [Bacterial composition and resistance from urinary tract infections in females].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial composition and antibacterial resistance in female urinary tract infections (UTI) in China. METHODS: The disc diffusion test, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), test or E-test was used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility in 86 tertiary hospitals in China from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. WHONET 5.4 was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6071 pathogenic germs were collected from urine cultures of UTI female patients in the surveillance period, which included 5958 bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli 3529 strains (59.23%), Enterococcus spp 938 strains (15.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 394 strains (6. 61%) were the most common pathogens. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had 35.7% and 34.0% extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) positive rates, and their resistant rates to quinolones were about 70% and 40%, respectively. Enterococcus faecium was much more resistant to almost all the antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis. 0.9% Escherichia faecalis and 3. 8% Escherichia faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 2.7% and 4.8% were resistant to teicoplanin. Staphylococcus epdermidis was more common in UTI than Staphylococcus aureus, 79.1% and 75.0% of the isolates being methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus epdermidis (MRSE) or methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. No vancomycin intermediate or resistant staphylococcus was detected, but 4.9% teicoplanin intermediate rate was found in Staphylococcus epdermidis. The resistant rates to quinolones increased with the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance in UTI in Chinese females is a severe problem, which could be resulted from antimicrobial irrational use. In the selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of UTI, doctors should refer to the results of bacterial resistant surveillance.
TI  - [Multicenter study of in vitro activity of tigecycline in clinical isolates from  30 centers in Spain].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last years, the increase of antibiotic resistances of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is an important therapeutic problem. The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 750 bacterial isolates from 30 centers in Spain. METHODS: Multicenter and retrospective study. In 2005, thirty laboratories participated in this study. Data collected in this study included antimicrobial susceptibilities for S.aureus resistant to methicillin (MRSA), ESBL- E. coli or ESBL- K. pneumoniae, E. coli resistant to quinolons (E.coli- QR), Klebsiella spp and E. faecalis. Trains were obtained of the each Hospital s collection (5 strains of each microorganisms). The susceptibility determinations were performed locally by each laboratory following the standard method usually performed. The tigecycline susceptibility determinations were performed with E/test. RESULTS: Tigecycline was the most potent agent against MRSA, E. faecalis, E.coli-QR and ESBLs enterobacteriaceae; with MIC50-MIC90 values of: 0.125-0.25 g/ml; 0.125-0.5 g/ml; 0.25-0.75 g/ml and 0.38-1.5 g/ml; respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the excellent in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including multirresistant microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activity  of 2-styryl benzimidazoles.
AB  - A new series of novel 5-(nitro/bromo)-styryl-2-benzimidazoles (1-12) has been synthesized by simple, mild and efficient synthetic protocol by attempted condensation of 5-(nitro/bromo)-o-phenylenediamine with trans-cinnamic acids in ethylene glycol. Screening for in vitro anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv, anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial strains and anti-fungal activity against Candida albicans and Asperigillus fumigatus fungal strains were carried out. Compounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 showed higher anti-tubercular activity and compounds 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 have proved to be effective with MIC (microg/ml) and emerged as lead molecules showing excellent activities against a panel of microorganisms. All synthesized compounds were characterized using IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR, GC-MS and elemental analysis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against resistant Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci by time-kill assay.
AB  - This time-kill study was performed with 65 genetically unique clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci to further define the antibacterial activity of tigecycline. To our knowledge, this is the largest published time-kill study evaluating tigecycline activity to date. Isolates evaluated were 10 meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; 15 Escherichia coli, including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers; 15 Klebsiella pneumoniae, including 10 ESBL producers; 20 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), including 10 that were linezolid resistant; and 5 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Time-kill testing was performed using tigecycline concentrations of 1x, 2x, and 4x MIC with colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Tigecycline MICs (microg/mL) were < or =1 for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, regardless of the isolates' ESBL production; A. baumannii, 0.06 to 4; 9/10 (90%) were < or =2; E. faecalis < or =0.12; and VRE < or =0.25, regardless of linezolid susceptibility. In the time-kill assay, tigecycline significantly inhibited bacterial growth when compared with the growth control. The reduction in growth was <3 log(10) CFU/mL for all isolates, indicative of a bacteriostatic effect.
TI  - Novel furanylarylene arylsulfonylindolesulfonamides: synthesis and their antibacterial evaluation.
AB  - An array of furanylarylene arylsulfonylindolesulfonamides was synthesized through multi-step synthetic protocols involving bromination, stannylation, Stille cross coupling, reduction, arylsulfonylation, chlorosulfonylation, and condensation reactions. As a preliminary evaluation, these analogs were tested for antibacterial activity against a series of bacterial strains such as Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae using a two-fold serial dilution assay. Whereas analogs possessing unsubstitution, bromosubstitution, or methyl substitution on the benzene ring of benzenesulfonyl group were less active/inactive, the methoxy and chloro substituted counterparts were demonstrated to be comparatively more active. A few of them were found to exhibit better activity than the standard, streptomycin against selective organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial profile of fermented seed extracts of Ricinus communis: findings from a preliminary analysis.
AB  - The study was carried out to ascertain the antibacterial properties inherent in fermented seed extracts of Ricinus communis. Dry seeds of R. communis (Castor oil plant) were deshelled, grounded to powder, fermented, and then extracted both with alcohol and water using Soxhlet machine. Different concentrations of the extracts were tested against selected bacteria using diffusion method of susceptibility testing on sensitivity testing agar medium. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus were highly susceptible to both the methanol and water extracts of the seed while Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed reduced susceptibility. Enterococcus faecalis on the other hand was resistant to all the preparations tested. The active antimicrobial ingredients in fermented R. communis seeds should be identified while its medicinal value to humans properly investigated.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae) essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from the aerial parts of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-six compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were (E)-caryophyllene (27.0%), germacrene D (26.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus flavus ATCC 10240, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIMB 9111, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC24433). The essential oil showed activity against all the microorganisms tested, but differences in microbial susceptibility were registered.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and composition of essential oil from Tanacetum balsamita L. subsp. balsamita.
AB  - The aerial parts of Tanacetum balsamita subsp. balsamita were collected at full flowering stage from Tabriz, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Twenty seven components were identified, representing 99.2% of the total oil. Carvone (51.0%), beta-thujone (20.8%), 1,8-cineole (4.4%) and alpha-thujone (3.2%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of T. balsamita subsp. balsamita was studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity. The in vitro toxicological study based on the MTT cytotoxicity assay on human fetal skin fibroblast (HFSF) and Monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines showed IC50 values of 2500 and 1250 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial indicators of pollution of the Douala lagoon, Cameroon: public health implications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indiscriminate disposal of untreated wastes which are often heavily laden with sewage microorganisms some of which are pathogenic to humans into aquatic environments near cities could serve as potential dangers to human health. OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to investigate the scope of potential bacterial pathogens and to assess the extent of pollution of the Douala lagoon. METHODS: A total of eighty water samples were collected fortnightly from the lagoon at five stations from March to October 2005 and analysed for heterotrophic bacterial densities, coliform counts, faecal coliform and faecal streptococcal counts. Bacteria were isolated and identified using standard microbiology and biochemical techniques. RESULTS: High heterotrophic bacterial counts (33 x 10(5) - 161 x 10(5) CFU/ mL), total coliform counts (1.8 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) CFU/100 mL), faecal coliform counts (2.2 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) CFU/ 100 mL) and faecal streptococcal counts (2.1 x 102 - 2.3 x 10(2) CFU/100mL were observed in all sampling stations. Eleven species of bacteria: Bacteroides fragilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus mycoides and Serratia marcesens, were frequently isolated. CONCLUSION: The presence of potential bacterial agents such as Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli in the lagoon may pose a serious threat to the health and well being of users of the Lagoon and calls for urgent intervention.
TI  - New "ON-OFF"-type nanobiodetector.
AB  - A new type of nanobiodetector based on a limited number of polyaniline nanofibrils has been designed and tested against bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The cells attaching conducting nanofibrils modify locally the electrical conductivity making the polymer nanowires electrically inhomogeneous. The "defects" accumulate in nanofibrils changing suddenly their electrical conductivity above a threshold density (the percolation limit), enabling an easy flow of the charge carriers. The results are unique: the device works like an "ON-OFF" switch with nearly linear response above a threshold number of cells in the suspension examined, which is of an order of 10(5) to 10(6) CFU per 1 ml. Such a behaviour is important for bio-alarm systems, environmental monitoring and medical applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and essential oil composition of Satureja spicigera from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Satureja spicigera were collected at full flowering stage at  Gazvin, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Fourteen compounds were identified, of which carvacrol (53.74%) and thymol (36.03%) were the main constituents, representing 99.12% of the total oil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the essential oil was determined against six ATCC standard bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) using disc diffusion as well as measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations. The disc diffusion results and MIC values indicated high inhibitory activity against the test bacteria. The most susceptible organisms were the Gram-positive B. subtilis and S. aureus followed by E. faecalis, usually resistant to most common antibiotics. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were highly sensitive to the different oil concentrations in the disc diffusion method. Finally, P. aeruginosa, a highly resistant organism to most antibiotics, showed moderate susceptibility to Satureja spicigera essential oil.
TI  - Catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, Centre for paraplegia of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo, were included. The patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: Group A (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; Group B (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; Group C (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. From a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. The overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. Infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. The vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. Providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by Proteus mirabilis (16,3%), Escherichia coli (11,8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), Morganella morgani (5,4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), Providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were Gram-positive with Enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among Acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), Providencia rettgeri (86,7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85,4%), Providencia stuarti (84,3%) and Morganella morgani (81,0%). Lower rates of resistance were found in Group C, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. Eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. Significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. The analysis of Group C showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two Groups of patients. The objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. In addition, possible correlations between UTI and the type of bladder management were examined.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  - Clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections in a Saudi Arabian hospital.
AB  - The study describes the pathogens causing urinary tract infections (UTI) and the  antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of health care-associated (HCA) and community-acquired (CA) isolates. Of the total of 3,989 nonrepetitive urinary cultures, 4.7% (n=188) were HCA and 95.3% (n=3,801) were CA isolates. Gram-negative organisms totaled 3,607 (90.4%) vs. 9.6% Gram-positive organisms. In CA-UTI, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis constituted 66, 11.4, and 5.4%, respectively. HCA-UTI episodes were caused by E. coli (37.8%), K. pneumoniae (14.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%). The susceptibility rates of E. coli to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone in HCA and CA isolates were 53.3 and 74.1%, 42.2 and 62.7%, 32.5 and 97.0%, and 62.3 and 92.7%, respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected in 8.1 and 7.4% isolates, respectively, of CA and HCA isolates of E. coli. CA isolates of K. pneumoniae were more susceptible to TMP-SMX (89.2 vs. 60.4%), ciprofloxacin (92.6 vs. 67.9%) and cefuroxime (93.8 vs. 24.5%) than HCA isolates. The susceptibility of HCA and CA isolates of E. faecalis to penicillin G and nitrofurantoin were 34.8 and 80%, and 78.3 and 93.6%, respectively (p<0.001). In conclusion, antimicrobial resistance is high to commonly used oral agents, rendering them inappropriate for empirical use.
TI  - Novel E. coli beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III inhibitors as targeted antibiotics.
AB  - Beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) III is a condensing enzyme that initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in most bacteria. We determined three pharmacophore maps from receptor-oriented pharmacophore-based in silico screening of the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli KAS III (ecKAS III) and choose 16 compounds as candidate ecKAS III inhibitors. Binding inhibitors were characterized using saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy (STD-NMR), and binding constants were determined with fluorescence quenching experiments. Based on the results, we propose that the antimicrobial compound, 4-cyclohexyliminomethyl-benzene-1,3-diol (YKAs3003), is a potent inhibitor of pathogenic KAS III, displaying minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range 128-256 microg/mL against various bacteria.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Bacteremia coexisting with tophaceous gout of the spine mimicking spondylodiscitis: a case report.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report and review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: To report a  rare case of bacteremia coexisting with spinal gout initially suspected as pyogenic spondylodiscitis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Gouty spine is a rare disease. It is even rare when coexisting with bacteremia. The presentation as pain, fever, and positive blood culture will make it more difficult to distinguish from spinal infection. METHODS: A 64-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency was admitted to the emergency department with a fever of 39 degrees C, chills, and back pain. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated white count and neutrophils; her serum glucose level was 279 mg/dL. The C-reactive protein level was 25.55 mg/dL and serum uric acid was in the upper range of normal. Blood cultures revealed Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Urine culture revealed 3 separate gram-negative bacilli. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed contrast enhancement in the L4-L5 and T5-T9 vertebral bodies. Infective spondylodiscitis of the lumbar and thoracic spine was suspected. RESULTS: Because antibiotic treatment had failed, surgical debridement with diskectomy, partial corpectomy, and allogenous strut graft reconstruction (T8-T9) was performed. During the operation, 600 cc of pleural effusion was drained. Chalky white material was noted at the T8-T9 disc and the adjacent vertebral bodies. Cultures for bacteria, tuberculosis, and fungus were all negative. Histologic examination revealed deposition of eosinophilic crystal-like material, and a diagnosis of tophaceous gout of the spine was established. CONCLUSION: This is, to our knowledge, the first case of bacteremia coexisting with multiple areas of tophaceous gout of the spine. Although uncommon, gouty spine should be added into the differential diagnosis of patients with back pain and bacteremia.
TI  - Large scale multiplex PCR improves pathogen detection by DNA microarrays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium density DNA microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. However, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen DNA. RESULTS: To increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex PCR (LSplex PCR) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. This protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. The LSplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. Application of LSplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen DNA by microarray hybridization by using LSplex PCR.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - [Biochemical and bacteriological investigation of six cases of purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) in a geriatric ward for dementia].
AB  - AIM: Purple urine bag syndrome is a condition in which the urinary catheter bag turns purple. A tryptophan-indigo hypothesis has been proposed as the mechanism of PUBS, in which bacterial decomposition of tryptophan in gut associated with chronic constipation, bacterial overgrowth in the urinary tract and alkaline urine causes production of indigo and discoloration. We considered that further investigation of cases was needed. METHODS: We investigated 6 cases exhibiting PUBS (3 males and 3 females). RESULTS: All cases had chronic constipation. Oral ingestion was impossible in one case. PUBS disappeared after antibiotic treatment (3 cases) or spontaneously (one case). Alkaline urine and indicanuria were not found in all cases that showed the disappearance of PUBS. In bacterial culture of urine during the exhibition of PUBS, Enterococcus faecalis was isolated together with Morganella morganii (3 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one case). Single infections by Klebsiella pneumoniae or Citrobacter species were also found. After disappearance of PUBS, infected bacterial species changed but no cases showed sterile urine. Urine and blood alpha-amino-n-butyric acid levels reduced after the disappearance of PUBS whereas tryptophan levels did not show related changes. In one case, blood protein concentration increased after the spontaneous disappearance of PUBS. Indicanuria and alkalization of urine from urinary catheter bag were more intense than of fresh urine. CONCLUSIONS: The present results generally support the 'Tryptophan-indigo hypothesis'. Furthermore, it was suggested that additional factors associated with the occurrence of PUBS are an environment that facilitates specific bacterial growth in a hospital as well as abnormal metabolism relating to alpha-amino-n-butyric acid and reduced protein synthesis in patients.
TI  - One-pot synthesis of 5-phenylimino, 5-thieno or 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial and antitumor activity.
AB  - We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of rare 4-substituted-5-phenylimino, 5-thieno- and 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles. Dithiazoles were selectively obtained in moderate to high yields (25-73%) via a one-pot reaction from various ethanoneoximes with sulfur monochloride, pyridine in acetonitrile followed by treatment by corresponding nucleophiles (aniline, thioacetamide and formic acid). All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (against bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Listeria inocua), antifungal (against pathogenic strains Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Issatchenkia orientalis) and antitumor (on human cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) activity. 4-(2-Pyridinyl)-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione and 4-ethylcarboxyl-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione (5d, 5h) that are active against Gram-positive bacteria are significantly active against fungi. 4-(2-Benzofuranyl)-5-phenylimino-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole (4e) exerts antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and other antimicrobials against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms collected from the Asia-Pacific Rim as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST).
AB  - As part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST), Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms were collected from 31 medical centres in nine countries in the Asia-Pacific Rim between 2004 and 2007. Overall, 34.2% of Acinetobacter spp. were multidrug-resistant, and 17.0% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10.6% of Escherichia coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. A total of 39.5% of Staphylococcus aureus were meticillin-resistant and 21.7% of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant. Tigecycline MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were <or=2mg/L against Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and <or=0.25mg/L against S. aureus, E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Antimicrobial resistance is widespread in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Tigecycline has excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including resistant strains.
TI  - Role of human CD36 in bacterial recognition, phagocytosis, and pathogen-induced JNK-mediated signaling.
AB  - Scavenger receptor CD36 mediates Staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis and initiates TLR2/6 signaling. We analyzed the role of CD36 in the uptake and TLR-independent signaling of various bacterium, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Expression of human CD36 in HeLa cells increased the uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria compared with the control mock-transfected cells. Bacterial adhesion was associated with pathogen phagocytosis. Upon CD36 transfection, HEK293 cells, which demonstrate no TLR2/4 expression, acquired LPS responsiveness as assessed by IL-8 production. The cells demonstrated a marked 5- to 15-fold increase in cytokine release upon exposure to gram-negative bacteria, while the increase was much smaller (1.5- to 3-fold) with gram-positive bacteria and lipoteichoic acid. CD36 down-regulation utilizing CD36 small interfering RNA reduced cytokine release by 40-50% in human fibroblasts induced by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as LPS. Of all MAPK signaling cascade inhibitors tested, only the inhibitor of JNK, a stress-activated protein kinase, potently blocked E. coli/LPS-stimulated cytokine production. NF-kappaB inhibitors were ineffective, indicating direct TLR-independent signaling. JNK activation was confirmed by Western blot analyses of phosphorylated JKN1/2 products. Synthetic amphipathic peptides with an alpha-helical motif were shown to be efficient inhibitors of E. coli- and LPS-induced IL-8 secretion as well as JNK1/2 activation/phosphorylation in CD36-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that CD36 functions as a phagocytic receptor for a variety of bacteria and mediates signaling induced by gram-negative bacteria and LPS via a JNK-mediated signaling pathway in a TLR2/4-independent manner.
TI  - Dual fluorescence system for flow cytometric analysis of Escherichia coli transcriptional response in multi-species context.
AB  - When studying interspecies interactions in a bacterial consortium, it may be desirable to analyze one species' transcriptional response as influenced by the other species. We developed a dual fluorescence system of Escherichia coli for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS)-based analysis for such a purpose. First, we generated E. coli SCC1 strain, which constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP), but otherwise showed no observable difference from the parent strain MG1655 with respect to morphology, growth, and FACS-analyzed side- and forward-scatter profiles. Next, to analyze transcriptional response, plasmids carrying promoters of interest fused to a red fluorescent protein (AsRed2) reporter, were introduced into strain SCC1. Quantification of promoter activities of araB, lacZ, fadB and rpoE via AsRed2 reporter verified that the induction levels are similar between MG1655 and SCC1 strains. In mixtures and co-cultures, GFP expression of E. coli SCC1 allowed it to be separated from non-E. coli species by FACS to purity levels of 96.7-100.0%. When a mixture of E. coli SCC1 carrying promoter-AsRed2 fusion and a non-E. coli strain was analyzed by FACS, it enabled (i) distinction of E. coli SCC1 from the non-E. coli strain, (ii) analysis of the E. coli promoter activity via AsRed2 expression and (iii) identification of transcriptional heterogeneity within the E. coli population. Co-cultures of E. coli SCC1 with Klebsiella pneumoniae and/or Enterococcus faecalis analyzed by FACS showed that E. coli fadB and rpoE transcription were differentially influenced by partner species.
TI  - Infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients who developed an infection in our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Barringtonia acutangula against Selected Urinary Tract  Pathogens.
AB  - Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn belonging to family Barringtoniaceae was investigated to evaluate In vitro antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanolic, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli the major urinary tract infection causing pathogens were tested by disc diffusion assay method and the minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated. Ethanol (95%) extract exhibited broader spectrum of inhibition followed by chloroform, petroleum ether and aqueous extracts against the urinary tract pathogens under test. An attempt has been made to compare the activity of extracts with standard antibiotics against selected urinary tract infection causing pathogens.
TI  - Urinary infections due to multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli among persons with HIV disease at a tertiary AIDS care centre in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the spectrum of opportunistic infections due to HIV infection has been widely discussed, there are very limited data available in south India on certain incident infections especially urinary tract infections (UTI) in HIV-infected subjects. METHODS: Bacterial aetiology of 350 symptomatic UTI in HIV-infected subjects and the drug resistance pattern of the Escherichia coli isolates tested between June 2005 and July 2007 at the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV Referral Centre in Chennai has been described here. RESULTS: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in HIV patients, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates were multi-drug-resistant and 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary pathogens in HIV-infected patients demonstrate high antimicrobial resistance and with majority of therapy for UTIs being empiric, constant updates of the aetiological agents and their drug susceptibility pattern would largely be beneficial to clinicians in choosing the right drug.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - The crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust Foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization. Models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. The catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. The effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the pH of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. The extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. In models inoculated with communities containing Proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary pH that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. The biocide had no effect on populations of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. In models inoculated with a mixed community containing Providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. Although K. pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of Providencia rettgeri. The results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of Salvia chloroleuca.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  Shahrestanak (Tehran province of Iran). The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-Pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of S. chloroleuca was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model of urinary tract infection.
AB  - Diabetics have a higher incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), are infected  with a broader range of uropathogens, and more commonly develop serious UTI sequelae than nondiabetics. To better study UTI in the diabetic host, we created and characterized a murine model of diabetic UTI using the pancreatic islet beta-cell toxin streptozocin in C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 mouse backgrounds. Intraperitoneal injections of streptozocin were used to initiate diabetes in healthy mouse backgrounds, as defined by consecutive blood glucose levels of >250 mg/dl. UTIs caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UTI89), Klebsiella pneumoniae (TOP52 1721), and Enterococcus faecalis (0852) were studied, and diabetic mice were found to be considerably more susceptible to infection. All three uropathogens produced significantly higher bladder and kidney titers than buffer-treated controls. Uropathogens did not have as large an advantage in the Toll-like receptor 4-defective C3H/HeJ diabetic mouse, arguing that the dramatic increase in colonization seen in C3H/HeN diabetic mice may partially be due to diabetic-induced defects in innate immunity. Competition experiments demonstrated that E. coli had a significant advantage over K. pneumoniae in the bladders of healthy mice and less of an advantage in diabetic bladders. In the kidneys, K. pneumoniae outcompeted E. coli in healthy mice but in diabetic mice E. coli outcompeted K. pneumoniae and caused severe pyelonephritis. Diabetic kidneys contained renal tubules laden with communities of E. coli UTI89 bacteria within an extracellular-matrix material. Diabetic mice also had glucosuria, which may enhance bacterial replication in the urinary tract. These data support that this murine diabetic UTI model is consistent with known characteristics of human diabetic UTI and can provide a powerful tool for dissecting this infection in the multifactorial setting of diabetes.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - A novel transposon, Tn6009, composed of a Tn916 element linked with a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize a novel conjugative transposon Tn6009 composed of a Tn916 linked to a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon in representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated in Nigeria and Portugal. METHODS: Eighty-three Gram-positive and 34 Gram-negative bacteria were screened for the presence of the Tn6009 using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR, hybridization of PCR products, sequencing and mating experiments by established procedures. RESULTS: Forty-three oral and 23 urine Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates carried the Tn6009. Sequencing was performed to verify the direct linkage between the mer resistance genes and the tet(M) gene. A Nigerian Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from a urinary tract infection patient, and one commensal isolate from each of the other Tn6009-positive genera, Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. isolated from the oral and urine samples of healthy Portuguese children, were able to act as donors and conjugally transfer the Tn6009 to the Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 recipient, resulting in tetracycline- and mercury-resistant E. faecalis transconjugants. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a novel non-composite conjugative transposon Tn6009 containing a Tn916 element linked to an S. aureus mer operon carrying genes coding for inorganic mercury resistance (merA), an organic mercury resistance (merB), a regulatory protein (merR) and a mercury transporter (merT). This transposon was identified in 66 isolates from two Gram-positive and three Gram-negative genera and is the first transposon in the Tn916 family to carry the Gram-positive mer genes directly linked to the tet(M) gene.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Surveillance study in Europe and Brazil on clinical aspects and Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology in Females with Cystitis (ARESC): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. INTERVENTION: Patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. MEASUREMENTS: This survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine European countries and in Brazil. Female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinical data of 4264 eligible patients were analysed. A positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. Within the 3018 pathogens, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (45.1%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). In all countries a susceptibility rate to E. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. The susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. They may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - Activity of amikacin, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin alone and in combination against resistant nosocomial pathogens by time-kill.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the synergistic activity of amikacin/ertapenem, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin)/ertapenem and amikacin/fluoroquinolones combinations against resistant nosocomial pathogens. METHODS: Time-kill studies were performed over 24 hours using an inoculum of 5 x 10(6) - 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL. Antibiotics were tested at the 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations. RESULTS: At MIC and/or 4 x MIC concentrations, the antibiotic combinations showed additive or synergistic activity against Acinetobacter strains and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. In Escherichia coli strains, synergy was seen when amikacin was combined with ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin; ertapenem in combination with fluoroquinolones demonstrated antagonism. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, synergistic effect was exhibited by ertapenem plus amikacin and ertapenem plus fluoroquinolones. The antibiotic combinations showed antagonistic interaction in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: The antibiotic combinations showed additive or synergistic activity against many gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Omphalitis with fatal outcome in new-born baby boy].
AB  - Omphalitis is a serious condition with important morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The most commonly involved micro-organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We describe a Danish patient with cellulitis, severe septicaemia, and portal vein thrombosis as fatal complications of omphalitis. In spite of early recognition and prompt treatment in this case, it was not possible to save the child.
TI  - The incidence of infectious diseases after renal transplantation: a single-centre experience.
AB  - This single-centre study was designed to investigate the incidence of infections  and their causative pathogens during the first three months after renal transplantation (RTx) in patients who had undergone the procedure in 2005 (n=174). We compared this group of patients with a previous one (1998-2000, n=437). In 2005, infection was diagnosed in 82 patients (47%). Symptomatic lower urinary tract infection (UTI) was present in 43 patients (25%), pyelonephritis in 15 (8.6%), and urosepsis in 7 (4%). Wound infection developed in 21 patients (12%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in 15 (8.6%), and pneumonia in 5 (3%). The most frequent pathogens in UTI were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Pathogens of wound infection included Staphylococcus coagulase negative and K. pneumoniae. Pneumonia was frequently caused by Mycoplasma pneumophila. Compared with the previous group, we noted decreases in the total number of infections (77.7 vs. 47%, P<0.001), pneumonia (8.5 vs. 3%, P<0.02) and UTI (33.3 vs. 24.7%, P<0.05). We observed an increased incidence of multiresistant Klebsiella. Based on these results, we have changed our scheme of antibiotic prophylaxis and the algorithms of antibiotic treatment. We reduced the use of antibiotics with an adverse epidemiological effect (quinolones, third-generation cephalosporins) and increased the use of relatively safe antibiotics (penicillins, aminopenicillins, with and without beta-lactam inhibitors).
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - [Epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (PB)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. This study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after PB in a series of 1,216 biopsies. Bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. RESULTS: All patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before PB. Bacterial identification was possible in fourteen cases: E. coli (nine cases), Proteus mirabilis (one case), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), Enterococcus faecalis (one case), Staphylococcus Spp (one case), Clostridium perfringens (one case). Only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). A high rate of resistance of E. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. However, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2GC and 3GC) and amikacin in 100% of cases. Prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. Empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2GC or 3GC, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Salvia species essential oils from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia multicaulis, S. sclarea and S. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. In contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of S. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Development of a surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance system, calculation of SSI rates and specification of important factors affecting SSI in a digestive organ surgical department.
AB  - We have developed an original system to conduct surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance. This system accumulates SSI surveillance information based on the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System and the Japanese Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JNIS) System. The features of this system are as follows: easy input of data, high generality, data accuracy, SSI rate by operative procedure and risk index category (RIC) can be promptly calculated and compared with the current NNIS SSI rate, and the SSI rates and accumulated data can be exported electronically. Using this system, we monitored 798 patients in 24 operative procedure categories in the Digestive Organs Surgery Department of Mazda Hospital, Mazda Motor Corporation, from January 2004 through December 2005. The total number and rate of SSI were 47 and 5.89%, respectively. The SSI rates of 777 patients were calculated based on 15 operative procedure categories and Risk Index Categories (RIC). The highest SSI rate was observed in the rectum surgery of RIC 1 (30%), followed by the colon surgery of RIC3 (28.57%). About 30% of the isolated infecting bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Using quantification theory type 2, the American Society of Anesthesiology score (4.531), volume of hemorrhage under operation (3.075), wound classification (1.76), operation time (1.352), and history of diabetes (0.989) increased to higher ranks as factors for SSI. Therefore, we evaluated this system as a useful tool in safety control for operative procedures.
TI  - Intrathecal baclofen does not inhibit the growth of different bacterial species and Candida albicans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity of intrathecal baclofen was investigated.  Several different microorganisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains); S epidermidis; Enterococcus faecalis; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Candida albicans. METHODS: Three experimental approaches were used to assess baclofen antimicrobial activity: (1) determination of the MIC; (2) determination of the MBC; and (3) kinetic time-kill assay. Experiments were performed according to current methods of the NCCLS. RESULTS: As compared with control organisms exposed to physiologic saline, organisms exposed to baclofen over a 10-day period failed to reduce the number of viable cells by at least 3 log(10), as requested by NCCLS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Because the viability of the investigated organisms was not reduced over that of microbial suspensions exposed to physiologic saline, we conclude that intrathecal baclofen has no measurable activity against different bacterial species and C albicans.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  - Uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from April 1997 to March 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. The various isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial UTI exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. Culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver-containing dressings on wound microorganisms using an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  - Antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. In this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. The antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing Hydrofiber (SCH) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (NCS), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (ZOI) test. When grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. ZOIs associated with SCH dressing ranged between 5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the NCS against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. When grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. The SCH dressing was most effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus (ZOI range: 2.6-6 mm); the NCS was most effective against strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (i.e. ZOI range: 1-2.8 mm). Similarly to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. Although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority of cases, the SCH dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than the NCS.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in Brescia, Italy: etiology of uropathogens and antimicrobial resistance of common uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are associated with substantial morbidity and recurrent infections. Antibiotic therapy is generally initiated empirically because early treatment decreases the rate of morbidity resulting from UTI. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance has become an increasingly pressing problem in many countries. In this study, the resistance patterns of urinary isolates to commonly used antimicrobials were determined in order to evaluate the options for empirical antibiotic therapy of UTI in out- and in- patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on urine samples examined in this laboratory in 2002-2005. The isolates were divided into the following three groups: isolates from hospital inpatients, isolates from community outpatients, and isolates from catheterized patients. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most common etiologic agent isolated, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Over the four-year period, a decrease in the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a parallel increase in Candida spp. in hospitalized patients were observed. Against Gram-positive isolates, enterococci in particular, ampicillin and glycopeptides demonstrated the best, most consistent activity. Among Escherichia coli isolates, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins, and penicillin/betalactams were the best options for therapeutic treatment because of the presence of a rate of resistance to cotrimoxazole and fluoroquinolones of over 10%, while the most active drug against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was piperacillin/tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: Region-specific surveillance studies provide additional information about the type of pathogens causing UTIs and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Therefore, these data can serve as a basis to develop national country-specific guidelines for the empirical treatment of UTIs.
TI  - [Biological hazards in air at municipal waste landfills].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the microbiological air quality at the selected municipal waste landfills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted during the summer at two municipal landfills. Air samples were collected on agar plates. The evaluation was based on the concentration levels of airborne bacteria and fungi and the identification of isolated strains. RESULTS: The total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the level of 10(3) cfu/m3. The highest concentrations of bacteria in air were observed during unloading, disposing and compacting of municipal wastes (landfill 1 - 6,1 x 10(3) cfu/ml, landfill 2 - 5,4 x 10(2) cfu/m3). The highest concentrations of fungi in air were observed at filled up parts of the landfills (landfill 1 - 4,8 x 10(2) cfu/m3, landfill 2 - 1,2 x 10(3) cfu/m3). The qualitative analysis of the air samples indicated the presence of 21 bacterial and fungi. Among of them bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans are classified as harmful biological agents. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of bacteria and fungi in air samples collected at the selected municipal waste landfills did not exceed the reference values. The concentration levels of bioaerosols are diversified according to the size of the landfill, the total number of accumulated wastes and the level of area usage. It is suggested using by municipal waste workers personal protective equipment, especially for respiratory airways and skin and also keeping the rules of individual hygiene.
TI  - Frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  - An increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. The tendency of patients in this population to acquire UTI is not completely understood. We aimed at investigating the incidence of UTI in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. Twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. On admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of UTI. Serum biochemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic UTI. Urine cultures revealed E. coli in five (50%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and Enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. The etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with UTI were BA in five, PFIC in three, Wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. We found a significantly greater number of UTIs in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). The mean age of the patients with UTI was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without UTI (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). Levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with UTI than in those without UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, GGT, BUN, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and PELD scores. In patients with bacteriuria, renal USG revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. Scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with UTI. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. In conclusion, symptomatic UTI is common in children with cirrhosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. In febrile children with chronic liver disease, UTI should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of autologous platelet gel enriched with growth factors and  other active substances: an in vitro study.
AB  - Platelet-rich plasma is a new inductive therapy which is being increasingly used  for the treatment of the complications of bone healing, such as infection and nonunion. The activator for platelet-rich plasma is a mixture of thrombin and calcium chloride which produces a platelet-rich gel. We analysed the antibacterial effect of platelet-rich gel in vitro by using the platelet-rich plasma samples of 20 volunteers. In vitro laboratory susceptibility to platelet-rich gel was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. Baseline antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the zones of inhibition on agar plates coated with selected bacterial strains. Zones of inhibition produced by platelet-rich gel ranged between 6 mm and 24 mm (mean 9.83 mm) in diameter. Platelet-rich gel inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and was also active against Escherichia coli. There was no activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, platelet-rich gel seemed to induce the in vitro growth of Ps. aeruginosa, suggesting that it may cause an exacerbation of infections with this organism. We believe that a combination of the inductive and antimicrobial properties of platelet-rich gel can improve the treatment of infected delayed healing and nonunion.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the growth inhibitory activities of Triphala against common bacterial isolates from HIV infected patients.
AB  - The isolation of microbial agents less susceptible to regular antibiotics and the rising trend in the recovery rates of resistant bacteria highlights the need for newer alternative principles. Triphala has been used in traditional medicine practice against certain diseases such as jaundice, fever, cough, eye diseases etc. In the present study phytochemical (phenolic, flavonoid and carotenoid) and antibacterial activities of aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala and its individual components (Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica and Emblica officinalis) were tested against certain bacterial isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, S. flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi) obtained from HIV infected patients using Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. T. chebula was found to possess high phytochemical content followed by T. belerica and E. officinalis in both aqueous and ethanol extracts. Further, most of the bacterial isolates were inhibited by the ethanol and aqueous extracts of T. chebula followed by T. belerica and E. officinalis by both disk diffusion and MIC methods. The present study revealed that both individual and combined aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala have antibacterial activity against the bacterial isolates tested.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in Malatya University Hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  - The aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in Malatya, which is located in Estern Anatolia part of Turkey. A total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of April-June 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by Phoenix 100 (Becton-Dickinson) system. As a result, 702 (89%) Gram negative and 90 (11%) Gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (14%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.7%). The species distribution was found as follows; K. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), P. aeruginosa (48/51), E.faecalis (27/40), E. cloacae (19/29), P.mirabilis (19/22), C.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and S. aureus (11/30). The first three array were shared by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. Our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants Bryophyllum pinnatum and Kalanchoe crenata.
AB  - Extracts from the leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum and Kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. Solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (Seaman's Schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (Sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). Leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. Another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. All extracts were lyophilized. These extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella paratyphi, Citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25213, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (Candida albicans). Agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. All the organisms except Candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. The squeezed-leaf juice of Kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with MIC of 8 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against Shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against Escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain Staphylococcus aureus while its MBC is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum. Extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
TI  - Exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. The interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated. In addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. Moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - In-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. Triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli C1214, Proteus mirabilis 296, Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Klebsiella pneumoniae 280, Staphylococcus aureus Newman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. Generic stents were utilized as controls. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. Lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated E. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein X and p-fimbriae. Triclosan stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. This drug-eluting stent provides both mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition of the essential oil of Gontscharovia popovii from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Gontscharovia popovii (B. Fedtsch. and Gontsch.) Boriss. were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one components were identified with the main constituent being carvacrol (71.9%), followed by linalool (5.5%), p-cymene (4.5%) and gamma-terpinene (4.4%). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of G. popovii was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the tested fungi and bacteria except for the resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - High risk of bacterobilia in advanced experimental chronic fasciolosis.
AB  - Fasciolosis is recognized as an important human disease. Wistar rats experimentally infected with Fasciola hepatica were examined using data obtained in the advanced chronic state of the disease (200, 300 and 400 days post-infection, dpi). Pigment stones (PS) and bile specimens were collected. The same procedure was applied in control rats. Liver tests were determined using stored serum samples. Bacteriological bile culture revealed viable bacteria (Escherichia coli, 45% of cases, Enterococcus faecalis, 45% and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10%). The presence of bacterobilia was associated with liver serum enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and total bilirubin levels. Multivariate analysis suggested an association between bacterobilia and the following factors: duration of parasitic infection and intensity of parasitic infection supported the impression that the obstruction caused by advanced chronic fasciolosis in the rat may be related to biliary sepsis. Extrapolation to human infection in fasciolosis hyperendemic areas is discussed. In conclusion, the results of the rodent model should lead to a reconsideration of treatment features in human disease, i.e. therapeutic strategies should not only include a parasitic treatment but also consider the possibility of bacterial co-infection.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Characterization of the microbial flora in disinfecting footbaths with hypochlorite.
AB  - Change or disinfection of footwear are measures to prevent cross contamination between areas with low and high hygienic levels in the food industry. The efficacy of disinfecting footwear is not well documented. Samples of used disinfectant and from swabbing of corners after draining were taken from disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine in four Norwegian cheese factories. Bacteria were present in 9 of 12 footbaths and more positive samples were found from swab samples than from used disinfectant. The microbial flora in footbaths varied between the dairies. In two dairies, the flora was dominated by Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. In the third dairy, both Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were present and in the fourth dairy, the flora was diverse (Acinetobacter sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus sp.). The strains were not resistant to the recommended user concentration of chlorine in bactericidal suspension or surface tests. The degree of attachment to plastic varied between strains and species and bacteria attached to surfaces were in general more resistant than suspended bacteria. The results of the survey indicated that disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine may act as contamination sources in food factories and should not be used without regular hygienic monitoring.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. Of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. The strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC) and VCM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or = 4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, CZOP, meropenem (MEPM), and carumonam (CRMN) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. Against Serratia marcescens, imipenem (IPM) and gentamicin (GM) had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. MEPM prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/mL. Next, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZOP, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/mL except IPM and MEPM having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activities of CZOP and CAZ were considered to be relatively good on MIC50 comparison (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. was  identified by GC and GC-MS analysis. The analysis of the oil resulted in the identification of forty-five components constituting 98.6% of the total oil. The main constituents were a-pinene (31.5%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (23.3%), p-cymene (6.7%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was tested by the disk diffusion method against four Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria together with a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The oil showed strong inhibition activity toward all the tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of GlmU enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  - The colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. We have developed an antibiofilm composition comprising an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (GlmU) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. The antibiofilm activity of GlmU inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (IDA), N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and NEM analogs, including N-phenyl maleimide, N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (oPDM), and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PyrM), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. Both IDA and NEM inhibited biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. All NEM analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The combination of oPDM with protamine sulfate (PS) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microM. In addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters against P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. Confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. Thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a GlmU inhibitor and protamine sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.
TI  - Predominance of Gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern Taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of empirical therapy. This study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. METHODS: During the period from 1996 to 2003 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, patients with NBSIs were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 4,038 episodes of NBSIs. The overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of NBSIs, respectively. The 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of NBSIs), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Candida spp. (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of S. aureus isolates. In contrast to Enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. The emerging antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, Candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing NBSIs and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. Surveillance of the characteristics of NBSIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - A "fishy" cough: hepatobronchial fistula due to a pyogenic liver abscess.
AB  - A hepatobronchial fistula is an anatomic communication between the liver parenchyma and the bronchial tree. Major causes of such fistulae include inflammatory conditions resulting from obstruction of the biliary tract and infectious processes, such as pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebiasis, and hydatid cysts. We report a rare case of a patient (with a chronic, recurrent hepatic abscess) who suffered a persistent, productive cough resulting from a hepatobronchial fistula.
TI  - Urinary tract infection and hyperbilirubinemia.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first two weeks of life. Jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible for the study. A bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6 PD) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all patients. Patients with UTI, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. Renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in cases with UTI. During follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were performed as well. A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. None of the infants had a high direct bilirubin level. UTI was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [Enterobacter aerogenes (3/8:38%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and Escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. Of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria. Bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. The sepsis screen was negative in all but one case with a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. None of the patients had a positive blood culture. Renal function tests were within normal levels in all patients. Renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). VCUG was performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade 3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. DMSA was performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. It is of importance that UTI can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life. Although it is well known that UTI is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three days of age with an unknown etiology.
TI  - Thermal inactivation of water-borne pathogenic and indicator bacteria at sub-boiling temperatures.
AB  - The use of harvested rainwater in domestic hot water systems can result in optimised environmental and economic benefits to urban water cycle management, however, the water quality and health risks of such a scenario have not been adequately investigated. Thermal inactivation analyses were carried out on eight species of non-spore-forming bacteria in a water medium at temperatures relevant to domestic hot water systems (55-65 degrees C), and susceptibilities to heat stress were compared using D-values. The D-value was defined as the time required to reduce a bacterial population by 90% or 1 log reduction. The results found that both tested strains of Enterococcus faecalis were the most heat resistant of the bacteria studied, followed by the pathogens Shigella sonnei biotype A and Escherichia coli O157:H7, and the non-pathogenic E. coli O3:H6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be less resistant to heat, while Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aeromonas hydrophila displayed minimal heat resistance capacities. At 65 degrees C, little thermal resistance was demonstrated by any species, with log reductions in concentration occurring within seconds. The results of this study suggested that the temperature range from 55 to 65 degrees C was critical for effective elimination of enteric/pathogenic bacterial components and supported the thesis that hot water systems should operate at a minimum of 60 degrees C.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Erythromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to establish the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of erythromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of erythromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with erythromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations reveal that formation of erythromycin complexes result in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of erythromycin increases with respect to parent erythromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (BACTEC 9240 and BacT/ALERT 3D) on culture positivity.
AB  - The effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into BacTAlert 3D and BACTEC 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees C vs 35 degrees C) on bacterial growth was evaluated. The delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. Culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. The positivity rate decreased significantly for Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. Culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees C for all microorganisms especially for Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for BACTEC compared with BacTAlert 3D and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees C compared with 22 degrees C. The negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.
TI  - Roxithromycin antagonism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of roxithromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of roxithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with roxithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of roxithromycin complexes results in antagonistic behavior against few microorganisms where in MIC is increased with respect to the parent drug, while against most of the microorganism, there was no effect on the MIC of the roxithromycin metal complexes with respect to parent roxithromycin.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  - In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.
TI  - Correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  - Bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. Species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. This differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. The objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. A literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs): Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Acetinobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. To determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in ICUs, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. All clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. A diversity index for each species was calculated as the number of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. The correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. Although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. They showed median survival times between 1.5 days (P. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (Enterococcus faecium). During the prospective ICU study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (Enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (E. coli) were found. A correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, P=0.024). Environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in ICUs. Infection control measures should consider this finding.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Purple urine bag syndrome in a hemodialysis patient.
AB  - Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is an uncommon disorder, in which the plastic disposable urinary catheter bag turns purple or blue following hours or days of urinary catheterization. The purple discoloration results from indirubin dissolved in the plastic mixing with indigo in the urine. Bacteria possessing indoxyl sulfatase degrade indoxyl sulfate into indirubin and indigo. Indoxyl sulfate is derived from the metabolism of tryptophan. PUBS usually occurs in chronic catheterized elderly women who are constipated and poorly ambulant. The clinical course is benign and rarely causes sepsis. This investigation reports a 61-year-old female diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis, who had two episodes of blue or purple urine bag discoloration. The urine culture of the first episode yielded Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas that of the second episode yielded Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Proteus vulgaris. Both episodes resolved following oral antibiotics treatment and placement of new foley catheters. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of PUBS in a dialysis patient.
TI  - [Bacterial flora and mycosis of the vagina in women with symptoms of vaginal inflammation].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the microbiological profile of vaginal flora in 30 women  with gynecologic problems and 20 pregnant women complaining about pathological symptoms {pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge}. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The discharge from posterior vaginal vault was examined microbiologically on the Columbia Agar with sheep blood, MacConkey and Sabourand cultures incubated of 48 hours in the temperature of 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bacterial infections were detected in 33 cases (66%), 12 of these women (24%) lived in urban, 21 (42%) in rural environment. From bacteria isolated from the vagina, most often because at 14 women stepped out Streptococcus agalactiae, at 11 Enterococcus faecalis at 8 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases bacterial inflammation was caused by two kinds of bacterium. At two women stepped out both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. In single cases it was Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. In all cases of inflammation mycosis was called out by from Candida albicans. One ascertained it at 14 among all given an examination women. Mixed inflammations called out both by mycosis and bacterial stepped out in 3 cases in age of 21-30. At two women it was Candida albicans and Streptococcus agalactiae, at one inflammation mycosis accompanied Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The common reason of vaginitis are bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, E coli. Both, place of living and women' s age influence the type of etiological factor.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter Italian survey: possible impact on guidelines.
AB  - During 2004 four Italian Laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. A total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. The overall prevalence of Escherichia coli was 85.3%. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. Determination of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of E. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). Cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. The three fluoquinolones tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. Nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. Against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. The results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent Italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of UTI in this country today.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - Benzimidazolyl quinolinyl mercaptotriazoles as potential antimicrobial and antiviral agents.
AB  - Condensation of ethylaceto acetate (EAA) with resorcinol in concentrated H2SO4 afforded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl coumarin (1), which on reaction with thiosemicarbazide in anhydrous pyridine yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-mercaptotriazole (2). Reaction of 2 with formaldehyde solution and amino acid in ethanol yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(N-methyl-aminoacid)-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-2''-mercaptotriazole (3a-e). Interaction of 3 with o-phenylenediamine in pyridine yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(aminobenzimidazolyl)-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-2''-mercaptotriazole derivatives (4a-e). The latter compounds were evaluated for their antiviral and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of a natural fungal population towards pathogenic bacteria. An in vitro study.
AB  - In the present work, we performed in vitro testing of 33 species of fungi of the  subdivision Deuteromycotina isolated from water and sediment of the Kolubara River for antagonistic action towards 11 species of pathogenic bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria, the species most sensitive to metabolic fluid of the fungi were Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteritidis, and Shigella sonnei, while the most resistant were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Of gram-positive bacteria, the most sensitive species was Staphylococcus aureus, while the most resistant was Enterococcus faecalis. Of the tested fungi, Penicillium canescens, P. simplicissimum, P. thomii, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. ochraceus, and Fusarium culmorum exerted inhibitory action on the greatest number of species of pathogenic bacteria, while Verticillium lateritium, V. tenerum, Phoma humicola, and Botrytis cinerea had an inhibiting effect on the least number of species.
TI  - An antibacterial and antiviral peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans.
AB  - Enterococcus mundtii ST4V, isolated from soya beans, produces a 3950Da antibacterial peptide active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptide also inactivated the herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G), a polio virus (PV3, strain Sabin) and a measles virus (strain MV/BRAZIL/001/91, an attenuated strain of MV). MV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 95.5%-99.9% inactivated by peptide ST4V at 400 microg/ml. Monkey kidney Vero cells were not inactivated, even at four times the level peptide ST4V displayed antiviral activity, indicating that the effect was not due to cytotoxicity. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed after treatment of peptide ST4V with Proteinase K, pronase, pepsin and trypsin. No change in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, suggesting that peptide ST4V was not glycosylated. This is the first description of an antibacterial and antiviral peptide with such broad-spectrum of activity, produced by a lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.

TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Suaveolindole, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene from Greenwayodendron suaveolens obtained via high-throughput natural products chemistry methods.
AB  - Utilizing high-throughput isolation, purification, and analysis methods applied to a natural products library, a new mass-limited antibacterial indolosesquiterpene, suaveolindole (1), was obtained from Greenwayodendron suaveolens. The miniaturization of the structure elucidation of 1 was performed primarily using the CapNMR probe. Compound 1 was found to possess significant in vitro antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 43223), Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 6538P), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 33591), with MIC values of 4, 8, and 8 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Influence of various criteria for elimination of duplicates when calculating the  prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms associated with urinary infections.
AB  - The effect of applying various criteria for elimination of repeated isolates in the same patient on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms frequently associated with urinary infections were analyzed. When time criteria were applied, there was a decrease in the number of isolates of 13.4-27.5%, whereas when variations in antibiotic susceptibility were considered, between 4.3 and 20.3% of the isolates were eliminated. The absolute number of isolates varied considerably depending on which of these two criteria were used, but neither criterion was seen to modify significantly the antibiotic susceptibility of these microorganisms and this confirms the recommendations of the NCCLS for this group of pathogens.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - High-resolution visualization of the microbial glycocalyx with low-voltage scanning electron microscopy: dependence on cationic dyes.
AB  - The microbial glycocalyx is composed of a variety of polyanionic exopolysaccharides and plays important roles in microbial attachment to different substrata and to other cells. Here we report the successful use of low-voltage scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM) to visualize the glycocalyx in two microbial models (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis biofilms) at high resolution, and also the dependence on fixation containing polycationic dyes for its visualization. Fixation in a paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde cocktail without cationic dyes was inadequate for visualizing the glycocalyx, whereas addition of various dyes (alcian blue, safranin, and ruthenium red) to the aldehyde cocktail appeared necessary for stabilization. The cationic dyes varied in size, shape, and charge density, and these factors appeared responsible for different phenotypic appearances of the glycocalyx with each dye. These results suggest that aldehyde fixation with cationic dyes for high-resolution LVSEM will be a useful tool for investigation of microbial biofilms as well as investigation of the extent and role of the glycocalyx in microbial attachment to surfaces.
TI  - Optimization of bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - The cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin ST13BR, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, inhibits the growth of L. casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Based on tricine-SDS-PAGE, bacteriocin ST13BR is 10 kDa in size. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after treatment with Proteinase K, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. Low bacteriocin activity (200 AU/ml) was recorded in BHI medium, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. Maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded after 23 h in MRS broth, but only at 30 degrees C. Tween 80 in MRS broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. Meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in MRS broth, stimulated bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml). Only 50% activity (3,200 AU/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 AU/ml. Bacteriocin production was not stimulated by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 AU/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 AU/ml). Activity levels less than 200 AU/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. Maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. Maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. The presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher KH(2)PO(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - [Search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  - For the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. As revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus. In 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens have been tested. B. longum strain 58B, B. infantis strain 37B, L. rhamnosus strain 12L and L. acidophilus strain 27L, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. These strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (up to 36 h). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (UBT) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. The mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. The mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. The UBTs, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an Escherichia coli ATCC reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, MHB): E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/0.008); E. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); Klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016); Proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); Enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); Staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and S. saprophyticus Ho94 (0.125/0.25). The median UBTs measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa and between 1:8 and 1:>or=1024 for the five Gram-positive strains. The median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains (incl P. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five Gram-positive strains. The UBTs up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (P<0.05 ) for both E. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all Gram-positive strains. For the UBTs at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the Proteus and Pseudomonas strains. The areas under the UBT-time-curve (AUBT) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (P ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for P. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (Gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually Gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated UTI performed previously [Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents (2004)].
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Microbial flora in ileal and colonic neobladders.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe bacterial colonization in patients with ileal and colonic  neobladders. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with right colon neobladders, 30 with ileal neobladders, 11 who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and 6 healthy controls were included. Culture of clean-catch, midstream urine specimens was done weekly for 3 weeks, and this was repeated after 6 months. Residual urine was measured, and the patients were interviewed about leakage. All patients and controls were antibiotic free during the study except for 13 of the ileal neobladder patients, who were treated with trimethoprim 100mg daily. RESULTS: Urine cultures from controls and prostatectomy patients were negative for bacteria, whereas 67% of the specimens from patients with neobladders, not on antibiotic therapy, were culture positive, and half of these contained uropathogenic species, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial colonization (including uropathogenic strains) was strongly correlated with residual urine (p<0.005), but not with leakage. Anaerobic strains were found more frequently (p=0.04) in urine from ileal neobladders than in urine from colonic neobladders. The 13 patients with ileal neobladders and on prophylactic antibiotic therapy carried bacteriuria in 80% of the samples, the majority being anaerobic strains. Uropathogenic strains, mainly Enterecoccus faecalis was revealed in 30% of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: The lower urinary tract of patients with ileal or colonic neobladders is heavily colonized with potentially uropathogenic and anaerobic bacteria. Complete bladder emptying reduces the bacterial burden. Anaerobic colonization is increased in neobladders reconstructed from ileum. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy does not seem to reduce the bacterial burden, but interferes with the bacterial composition.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei and Candida albicans. The results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Shigella dysenteriae. Bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  - The neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. This enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. Its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. Most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media. The limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. The establishment of the gut microbial population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. The climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. The foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. Following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. The maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. The bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. After the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. In full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces the development of a flora rich in Bifidobacterium spp. Other obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. During the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. In other studies the presence of a consistent number of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. The predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. According to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. Environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. In these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of Bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. In extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. According to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.
TI  - Leitbakteria of microbial biofilm communities causing occlusion of biliary stents.
AB  - Biliary stents inserted to relieve obstructive jaundice caused by biliary or pancreatic malignancies inevitably become occluded by microbial growth in the form of diverse microbial community biofilms. The scarce information available on these communities is based on cultivation methods, but such methods usually provide distorted overviews of community composition, so commonalities and differences in biliary stent communities are uncertain. We extracted DNA and RNA from the microbial communities of 11 biliary stents explanted from nine patients in hospitals from two different countries, amplified 16S rRNA and rDNA sequences, analysed the amplicons by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, and sequenced and deduced phylogenetic assignments of the major amplicons representing the major biofilm community members. We used a Modified Robbins Device (MRD) to study de novo development of a stent biofilm from a patient stent microbial community. Single-strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting revealed the same six abundant bacterial species, here designated Leitbakteria, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and two unculturable bacteria distantly related to E. coli and Shigella sonnei, in all of the stent biofilm communities. In the experimental biliary stent system, a sequential colonization of the stent surface was observed, with P. aeruginosa being the pioneer colonizer, followed by K. pneumoniae and one of the unculturable Leitbakteria, followed by the remainder of the community. The overview of microbial biofilm communities of biliary stents gained by the use of culture-independent methods revealed new unculturable bacteria as major members of biliary stent biofilms, and the diversity of the abundant members of the stent biofilms is considerably lower than suggested from earlier studies based on cultivation methods, and that communities from different stents from different patients in different countries are remarkably similar and have similar major members, the stent Leitbakteria.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Burkina Faso.
AB  - Burkina Faso is one of the Subsaharan African nations. No national services for monitoring of antibiotic resistance are available, so the number of reports of resistance patterns among hospital pathogens are inconsistent. In order to evaluate antibiotic resistance, a total of 1998 valuable microrganisms were analysed during 2000 at the Medical Centre St. Camille of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital. They were isolated as follows: 1012 from urine-culture, 503 from tonsil swabs, 398 from pus, 53 from sputum and 32 from blood-cultures. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism from urine (44%); Enterococcus faecalis from tonsil swabs (96.4%), Staphylococcus aureus from pus (17%) and K. pneumoniae (70%) from sputum. In general, resistance to the old antibiotics, such as aminopenicillins and cotrimoxazole was shown. The most active antibiotic was norfloxacin, a rarely used antibiotic in this country. In conclusion, our study shows that it is necessary to create antibiotic-resistance surveillance centers in the developing countries to adopt an accurate therapy to avoid exporting of antibiotic resistance to the developed countries linked to increased emigration.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Antimicrobial proficiency testing of National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance  System hospital laboratories.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System personnel report trends in antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. To validate select antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and to identify test methods that tend to produce errors, we conducted proficiency testing among NNIS System hospital laboratories. SETTING: NNIS System hospital laboratories in the United States. METHODS: Each laboratory received five organisms (ie, an imipenem-resistant Serratia marcescens, an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, a vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus epidermidis, and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESbetaL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae). Testing results were compared with reference testing results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: Of 138 laboratories testing imipenem against the Serratia marcescens strain, 110 (80%) correctly reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) or zone sizes in the resistant range. All 193 participating laboratories correctly reported the Staphylococcus aureus strain as oxacillin resistant Of the 193 laboratories, 169 (88%) reported correct MICs or zone sizes for the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. One hundred sixty-two (84%) of 193 laboratories demonstrated the ability to detect a vancomycin-intermediate strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis, however, disk diffusion performed poorly when testing both staphylococci and enterococci with vancomycin. Although laboratory personnel correctly reported nonsusceptible extended-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam results for K. pneumoniae, only 98 (51%) of 193 correctly reported this organism as an ESbetaL producer. CONCLUSION: Overall, NNIS System hospital laboratory personnel detected most emerging resistance patterns. Disk diffusion continues to be unreliable for vancomycin testing of staphylococci and must be used cautiously for enterococci. Further education on the processing of ESbetaL-producing organisms is warranted.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - A UK multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the UK to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. METHOD: During 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing UTI were collected from 8 centres in the UK. Isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired UTI in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired UTI other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired UTI in those greater than 65 years old (392). After re-identification, MICs for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using NCCLS procedures and interpretive guidelines. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). The next three pathogens of importance were Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. The activity of amoxycillin against E. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). Cefuroxime was very active against E. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). Cefuroxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of E. coli (96.3% susceptible) and E. faecalis but not against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. Ciprofloxacin was highly active against the UTI pathogens examined in this study with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (E. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against Pseudomonas spp. CONCLUSION: These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing UTI in the UK.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Current implications of drug resistance in spinal cord injury.
AB  - A 54-yr-old man with C6 quadriplegia and a neurogenic bowel and bladder was evaluated for clearance of a urinary tract infection after treatment for organisms susceptible to the antibiotics used, and an organism resistant to all antibiotics on the panel grew on the initial follow-up urine culture. Multidrug-resistant organisms present increasing challenges and risks in the management of the neurogenic bladder in patients with spinal cord injury. In an effort to control and reduce the impact and risk associated with these organisms, management methods of the neurogenic bladder and infection control policies should be adjusted according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and related research; such policies could include surveillance for multidrug-resistant organisms and isolation of patients who test positive for these organisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in Korea.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In Korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. In this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four Korean university hospitals during 1999-2000. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Gemifloxacin had the lowest MICs for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, while those for other Gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/L. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against Gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in Korea.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - [Survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of citrate and acetate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated citrate salt, acetate salt, and their combinations for antibacterial activity against a sample of common pathogens. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions were added to serial microdilutions of the salts in broth, with final cell concentrations of 10(4-5) colony-forming units per milliliter. After overnight incubation at 35 degrees C, the minimum inhibitory concentration was recorded. Bactericidal activity was screened by quantitative subcultures from the minimum inhibitory concentration dilution. RESULTS: Citrate salt was active against gram-positive species and Candida albicans but showed little activity against gram-negative species; acetate salt showed the opposite results. Their combination did not show synergism or antagonism. CONCLUSION: It may be feasible to take advantage of the different antibacterial spectra of these two agents and combine them for possible application such as food or medical preservative agents.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of milkfat after partial hydrolysis by calf pregastric lipase.
AB  - Studies on the kinetic characteristics of calf pregastric lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) have shown that it preferentially releases short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from bovine milkfat. The released fatty acids form mixed micelle structures. The aim of this investigation has been to test whether hydrolysed milkfat is antimicrobial, and how the state of the emulsion alters the bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. Partial hydrolysis of milkfat by pregastric lipase was carried out in two types of emulsion systems, containing either Triton X-100 or casein/lecithin, plus milkfat in citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0-6.0). The concentrations and compositions of fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. The minimum percentages of hydrolysed milkfat which affected growth and survival of selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were measured. The bacterial experiments were repeated using pure fatty acids at similar concentrations. Lauric acid (C12:0) was found to be the most potent bactericidal fatty acid against Enterococcae (Gram-positive), and caprylic acid (C8:0) was the most potent against coliforms (Gram-negative). Use of Triton X-100 for milkfat emulsification provided a more compatible medium for studying bacterial growth in the hydrolysed milkfat than did use of casein/lecithin. The results also show that the antimicrobial effects of individual fatty acids released from hydrolysed milkfat were at least additive and suggest that hydrolysis of milkfat may be a significant factor in controlling growth of organisms imbibed with food in pre-weaned animals. The amount of pregastric catalyzed triglyceride hydrolysis in the digestive tract is sufficient to produce an antibacterial concentration of fatty acids and monoglycerides.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction as a sensitive and rapid method for specific detection  of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples.
AB  - The fast diagnosis of Mycoplasma primary atypical pneumonia is impaired by the lack of routinely available culture methods for isolation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae from clinical specimens. Likewise, serological methods commonly used for diagnosis are insensitive and non-specific. In this study, we have established and applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to detect M. pneumoniae DNA in clinical samples originating from the respiratory tract. The PCR results were compared with those from culture and serology tests. To standardize the detection of M. pneumoniae by PCR, we first used DNA from culture grown organisms and clinical samples seeded with M. pneumoniae. PCR amplification was performed with M. pneumoniae-specific primers to amplify 144, 153 and 631 bp DNA fragments by using primer pairs MP5-1/MP5-2, P1-178/P1-331 and P1-178/P1-809, respectively. The amplification of the 631 bp DNA fragment was found to be most sensitive for the detection of M. pneumoniae. Using the most sensitive PCR, a total of 47 respiratory specimens from patients suspected of community acquired pneumonia were tested. While none of the specimens were positive for M. pneumoniae in culture, 6 specimens gave positive results by PCR. In 4 out of the 5 PCR positive samples tested serologically, the results were supported by elevated levels of anti-mycoplasma IgG/IgM/IgA. Thus, these results suggest that PCR is the most sensitive method to detect M. pneumoniae in clinical specimens.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - In vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  - Fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. The trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. Carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both Gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. All Gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/L of carboxyfullerene, whereas Gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/L carboxyfullerene. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for Gram-positive species, particularly for Streptococcus pyogenes A-20, which was killed rapidly. Intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by TEM and anti-carboxyfullerene binding assay. Damage to the cell membrane in Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. These findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - The migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over Foley catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of Foley catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. The sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms on the agar on the other side of the bridges. A collection of swarming, swimming and nonmotile species were tested in the model. The relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. RESULTS: The swarmer cells of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris migrated successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. The migration index of Serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. Indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. The mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). The swarmer cells of P. mirabilis moved through populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. They were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus over the catheters. The migration index of P. mirabilis swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa and S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. With the exception of S. marcescens, the incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. Swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and P. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. This suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.

TI  - Grazing rates of diverse morphotypes of bacterivorous ciliates feeding on four allochthonous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The permanence in aquatic systems of allochthonous bacteria coming from sewage effluents is a risk for public health. This work aimed to analyse the elimination of the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by a riverine ciliate community. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ciliates were characterized and identified on the basis of morphological and behavioural features and grouped in nine morphotypes. Differential grazing by each morphotype on the four allochthonous bacteria was carried out by adding fluorescently labelled bacteria to the water samples, and measuring their uptake along time. CONCLUSIONS: The nine morphotypes were present in all the samples but in different proportions, being the most abundant the small scuticociliates and hipotrichs. The smallest morphotypes showed grazing rates lower than 20 FLB ciliate(-1) h(-1), with a preference towards K. pneumoniae. The larger morphotypes showed in general the highest grazing rates, but the selectivity was hardly attributable to bacterial size or type of cell wall. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The elimination of allochthonous bacteria in an aquatic system may be highly different depending on the diversity of the ciliated protistan community in the system and on the nature of the bacterial prey.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) at intervals for up to 144 h. Ofloxacin showed higher concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. The median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens for which the MICs of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; Escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. Generally, the UBTs for gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the UBTs for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. According to the UBTs, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (MICs, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. Although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for the detection of bacterial ATP (Coral, USA). Of these samples, 49% were reported to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were E. coli (47%), Proteus mirabilis (7%), Enterococcus faecalis (6%) and K. pneumoniae (5%). The susceptibility studies showed 37% E. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. Seven strains of E. coli produced ESBL. Thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. Resistance to nitrofurantoin in K. pneumoniae was 38%. P. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% Staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. E. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. Fosfomycin continued to show high activity against Gram-negative bacilli. However, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. ESBL were detected in the isolates of E. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Isolation of yeasts and enteric bacteria in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and role of yeasts, enteric gram-negative rods and Enterococcus species in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis, and the antimicrobial effect of iodine potassium iodide (IKI) irrigation. METHODOLOGY: Forty symptom-free root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. In group A the canals were filled with calcium hydroxide for 10-14 days after cleaning and shaping; in group B the canals were irrigated with IKI for 5 min after cleaning and shaping followed by a permanent root filling. Microbiological samples were taken from the canals before and after the chemomechanical preparation and after iodine irrigation (group B). RESULTS: Microbes were isolated from 33 of 40 teeth in the initial sampling. Yeasts were isolated from six teeth, three of them together with E. faecalis. Enteric rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis) were present in three teeth and E. faecalis was isolated from 21 of the 33 culture positive teeth, 11 in pure culture. Growth was detected in 10 teeth of the second samples. Six of the 10 cases were E. faecalis, with five being a pure culture. All third samples (after IKI) except one were negative. The number of microbial cells per sample did not correlate with lesion size. Two flare-ups were recorded, both in teeth with a mixed infection. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of enteric bacteria and yeasts in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis was established. IKI improved the antimicrobial effect of the treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined and the results were compared with those obtained between 1991 and 1998. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those with uncomplicated UTIs and those with complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). About E. faecalis, increase of low sensitive strains noted in the former year showed a decreasing tendency, however, one strain each with MIC of 4 micrograms/ml to vancomycin (VCM) was detected in patients with both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. As for S. aureus, many sensitive strains to cephems, imipenem (IPM) and VCM were noted, and each MIC50 was better than that in the former years. S. aureus strains showing low susceptibility to arbekacin (ABK) were detected in patients with complicated UTIs in this year as well as in the former year, and one strain each with MIC of 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml was detected. Susceptibilities of E. coli were effective to all drugs except for penicillins and minocycline (MINO). Decrease of low sensitive strains was also noted in all drugs except for quinolones. Each MIC90 of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and sparfloxacin (SPFX) in patients with complicated UTIs against E. coli was 3 degrees classes lower than that in patients with uncomplicated UTIs. As for Klebsiella pneumoniae, decrease of low sensitive strains to cephems was noted in patients with uncomplicated UTIs in 1998. In 1999, low sensitive strains decreased also in patients with complicated UTIs, and few were detected. Susceptibilities of K. pneumoniae to quinolones were effective as compared with those in the former years with the MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below without detection of low sensitive strains. One low sensitive strain of K. pneumoniae with MIC of 8 micrograms/ml was detected for gentamicin (GM). Susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems were notable. The MIC90 of meropenem (MEPM) and IPM was 4 micrograms/ml each which was 2 degrees better than that in 1998. Resistant P. aeruginosa strains to other drugs except for monobactams decreased in 1999.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 499 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and Gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. The increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was also strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA. However, MSSA and MRSA showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). Carbapenems showed high activities against Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. Meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Quinolone resistant E. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. MEPM and carumonam (CRMN) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. On the other hand, one strain of K. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (CCL) and one strain of P. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  - Dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. Education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. Manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. Dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within DUWs. These methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. In order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. There are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. However, the Food and Drug Administration have not approved all products currently on the market. Our evaluation of Zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. It is also economical and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. Following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the DUWs was free from any viable microorganisms. This effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. The elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the DUWs was performed. Although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of DUWs following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. Finally, the product can be delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. From our study, Zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. Based on the research that has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. A combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality dental treatment water. Independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ADA, OSAP, and CDC guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. It is expected that in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems and products to deal with this issue. Until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in DUWs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two Cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (A and B) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. The nine strains of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. Results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon B leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the B leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both K. pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. Cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. The MICs of cinnamaldehyde against the E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and V. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
TI  - Etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a Yemeni City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Yemeni patients in Sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. METHODS: Consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in Sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). RESULTS: The number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). The ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). The causative agents were mainly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and Proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). The other pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). There was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. The isolation of Escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. Whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, Proteus species from 8% to 9%, Staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, Enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and Corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. Ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. CONCLUSION: The types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. It is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. It is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of certain quinolone derivatives.
AB  - A number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. Preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. Among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log GI(50) of -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log GI(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in South Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was carried out at a General Practice in South Trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. METHODS: Quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. Identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. Susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: From 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. Three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. Most males above 50 years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by Proteus mirabilis, 9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. All urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for Citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. The ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. Also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial properties of N-substituted derivatives of (E)-4-azachalcones.
AB  - Syntheses of 11 new N-bromoalkyl substituted bromides of (E)-4-azachalcone and N-o-(m- and p-) halobenzyl substituted halides of (E)-3'-hydroxy-4-azachalcone of antimicrobial activity are reported. Compounds 3d, 3e, 6b, 6c, and 6e reveal good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as well as moderate activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - [Post-traumatic bacterial meningitis].
AB  - 10 patients with posttraumatic bacterial meningitis were treated in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Jagielloniam University--Collegium Medicum during the period of 63 months. Traffic accidents were responsible for 80% of all cases of trauma. The most common place of injury was the base of anterior cranial fossa. Infecting agent was established in 8 cases. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus spp.) were found in 4 patients, Gram-negative aerobic cocci (Neisseria meningitidis) in 2 patients, and Gram-negative aerobic rods (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli) in 3 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was still highly sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Neisseria meningitidis was sensitive to penicillin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulonate. Gram negative aerobic rods were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Among 10 patients treated for posttraumatic bacterial meningitis 1 patient died and in 1 preserved vegetative state was diagnosed. In 4 patients severe or moderate disabilities developed, however 4 recovered completely. 6 patients after regression of the CNS infection were qualified to neurosurgical intervention. In 3 patients reconstructive operation of the basis of anterior cranial fossa with tissue glue Beriplast P. was done, the recovery was complete. 3 patients didn't agree to surgical operation, and we don't know what has happened with them. They have not come to the control visit.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - Probiotic activities of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - The interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. In this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) were investigated. Using intestinal Caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. The inhibitory effects of Lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. A decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with Lcr35. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of cell-free Lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, ETEC, EPEC, K. pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile. The growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. Together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
TI  - [Identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  - We developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. The susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. Any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. The combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. The second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. This subgrouping procedure was done every three months. Identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. The algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Enterococcus faecalis (EF), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Escherichia coli (EC) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. Three major subtypes of MRSA, KP and EF were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. Most of EC isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. Although PA and SP had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. This analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.
TI  - Weissella confusa (basonym: Lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: a case report.
AB  - Infection with Lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus leichmannii. The literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by Weissella confusa (basonym: Lactobacillus confusus), but the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. We describe a case of W. confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. This procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. He subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition. He later developed an Enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. Three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia. At the present admission, he had fever (T(max), 39.5 degrees C) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. Blood cultures grew K. pneumoniae and W. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). Imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. A culture of the patient's Hickman catheter tip was negative. The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. His condition improved, and he was discharged home, where he completed 4 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. Lactobacillemia seldom results in mortality; however, it may be a marker of a serious underlying disease. It is usually seen in patients who have a complex medical history or in patients who receive multiple antibiotics. Lactobacillus spp. are generally associated with polymicrobial infections, and when isolated from the blood, they need to be considered possible pathogens. The presence of a vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccobacilli on a blood culture should alert clinicians to the possibility of bacteremia caused by W. confusa or other small gram-positive rods.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: MYSTIC Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 3: Modification of ring-B.
AB  - Ring-B derivatization of totarol (1) afforded the series of compounds 2-22 which  were screened in vitro against: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several of the derivatives retained much of the antibacterial activity of totatol against the first three of these organisms (all gram-positive), but none was more active. The gram-negative Klebsiella was resistant to all compounds examined. Totarol (1) was shown to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria at 50 microM.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 2: Modifications at C-12 and O-13.
AB  - Alterations of the C-12 and C-13 aromatic ring substituents of totarol (1) afforded the series of derivatives 2-14, and introduction of substituents at C-12 gave exclusively 2a-14a. The majority of these analogues were tested in vitro against the following organisms: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results were evaluated in terms of structure-activity relationship which reveals that: (a) the phenolic moiety at C-13, in general, is essential for antibacterial activity at < 32 microg/mL against gram-positive species, and (b) derivatization at C-12 has an undesirable effect on the antibacterial activity of this class of compounds, while (c) all compounds tested are ineffective against the gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Activity of cecropin P1 and FA-LL-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  - Two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, FA-LL-37 and cecropin P1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five Lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. Both peptides inhibited Escherichia coli at 25 microM (FA-LL-39), and 1.56 microM (cecropin P1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microM, and 25 microM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microM, and 1.56 microM), but not Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. FA-LL-37 acted bacteriocidally against E. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two Gram-negative organisms. Cecropin P1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. Lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate Lactobacillus fermentum B-54, which was susceptible to FA-LL-37 at 100 microM. The differential activities of these peptides toward Gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. In addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1998 to May 1999. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs, vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) had strong activities. Among E. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in 1997. VCM showed the highest activity against MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs of VCM for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active against MRSA with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. Particularly, meropenem (MEPM) showed the highest activity with the MICs of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. Almost all the drugs except minocycline (MINO) showed high activities against Proteus mirabilis. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. MEPM, IPM and gentamicin (GM) showed high activities against Serratia marcescens. Generally, it seemed that resistant strains of S. marcescens had decreased since 1996.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 9-O-acyl- and 9-O-benzoyl-substituted berberrubines.
AB  - In the course of a structure-activity relationship study on berberrubine derivatives, a series of compounds bearing 9-O-acyl-(4-6) and 9-O-benzoyl- (7) substituents was synthesized with the expectation of increasing the antimicrobial activity. One of the berberrubine derivatives, 9-lauroylberberrubine chloride was the most active against Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison to berberine, the currently used antibiotic in clinic. This result suggested that the presence of lipophilic substituents of certain structures and sizes might be crucial for the optimal antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the Careggi General Hospital in the period July-December 1996].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. METHODS: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 UFC/ml were examined in our Laboratory from July through December 1996. Inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. Five different ward typologies were taken into account (Surgery, Medicine, Obstetrics, Spinal Unit and High Risk Wards). Isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. Antibiotic susceptibility was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. For strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. RESULTS: The results obtained show that bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are Escherichia coli (45.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). Those most frequently isolated among outpatients are Escherichia coli (58.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). As far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned, whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). This implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - [Advantages and disadvantages in the use of central venous catheters in children  with malignant diseases].
AB  - The authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. During 1997 central venous catheter type Hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). The average time of catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). Gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken from the catheter and hemoculture. The central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - [Preventive effect of postoperative disinfection of endoscope on bacterial adhesion to endoscope].
AB  - We took culture of throat swab from 77 subjects who were negative for infection of HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis infection before and after endoscopy. Moreover, the existence of bacterium including Helicobacter pylori at overcoat of endoscopic instrument was investigated right after examination and after disinfection of endoscope. Povidoneiodine, 70% alcohol and 1% benzalkonium chloride was used as a disinfectant for endoscope, and it took less than 10 minutes to wash by hand to disinfection. alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermids, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA were cultured in throat swab. The rate of adhesion of bacterium especially such as Candida, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermids to endoscope was considerably high. 23 of 77 subjects had H. pylori infection, and the adhesion of H. pylori to endoscope was found to be 65.2% of the subjects. On the contrast, no bacterium was detected from the endoscopic instrument after careful disinfection. These findings stress the importance of postoperative disinfection of the endoscope to prevent the chance to acquire bacterial infection.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 1: modifications of ring-C and pro-drugs.
AB  - A series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds with good bioavailability in vivo. These analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were O-glycosylated derivatives. They were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at MIC values of 7 microM. The results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. Amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (MIC 18 microM). The in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. Compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating human cell cultures, CH 2983, HeLa, and MG 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microM.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the Surveillance Network Database--USA.
AB  - To assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the United States. Between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. When staphylococcal isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/mL), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. We also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in Klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). Although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for isolates of Escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Comparison of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women. Sparfloxacin Multicenter Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Study Group.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common illness, with > or =30% of all women experiencing a UTI during their lifetime. Less than a decade ago, the standard therapy for acute uncomplicated UTIs involved treatment with > or =7 days of an antibacterial agent, but recent studies using a variety of newly introduced antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones, have demonstrated that a 1- to 5-day treatment regimen can be equally effective. This randomized, double-masked, multicenter study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of sparfloxacin with those of a 3-day regimen of sparfloxacin and a 7-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of women with community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. A total of 1175 women were enrolled; 395 received sparfloxacin as a single 400-mg dose on day 1, 394 received sparfloxacin as a 400-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 200 mg once daily for 2 additional days, and 386 received ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days. Patients were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics and underlying conditions. A total of 954 patients were clinically assessable; 490 of these were also bacteriologically assessable. All patients treated were included in the tolerability analysis. Escherichia coli (75.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.6%), and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.1%) were the most commonly isolated organisms. In the all-treated population, clinical success was achieved 5 to 9 days after therapy in 91.8%, 92.2%, and 91.6% of patients in the single-dose sparfloxacin, 3-day sparfloxacin, and 7-day ciprofloxacin groups, respectively; bacteriologic success was observed in 91.7%, 92.6%, and 96.6% of those in the 3 groups. Sustained clinical success rates 4 to 6 weeks after therapy were 76.6%, 80.2%, and 79.5% in the single-dose sparfloxacin, 3-day sparfloxacin, and 7-day ciprofloxacin groups, respectively; sustained bacteriologic success rates were 80.7%, 90.1%, and 92.6%. The most common adverse events were nausea, headache, vaginal thrush, dizziness, and diarrhea; >92% of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The 2 drugs had comparable frequencies of adverse events, except for photosensitivity, which occurred in 3.3% of the 3-day sparfloxacin group, 1.3% of the single-dose sparfloxacin group, and 0.3% of the ciprofloxacin group (P = 0.005). The 3-day sparfloxacin regimen was effective and well tolerated. The initial response to single-dose sparfloxacin treatment was comparable to the response to the other 2 regimens, but the single-dose regimen proved less effective over time, with higher rates of clinical recurrence and bacteriologic relapse. Sparfloxacin provides an alternative to ciprofloxacin for patients with acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection who are not at risk for photosensitivity reactions or adverse events associated with a prolonged corrected QT interval.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. However, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. In the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia col, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. Lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). Six oils did not inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. Variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. Twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity against C. albicans, Staph. aureus and E. coli. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against C. albicans and E. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against Staph. aureus. These results support the notion that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1996. The results were as follows: Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against MRSA. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. The carbapenems showed high activities against Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter cloacae. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of Serratia marcescens were detected. The antibacterial activity of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of CAZ, and there were some resistant strains.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - Stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  - AIM: To serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. METHODS: Stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. RESULTS: By day 30, predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterbacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. In breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (SE 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; Gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. On day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). Gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The gut of extremely low birthweight infants is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.
TI  - [Pancreatic abscess].
AB  
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - In vitro activities of aminomethyl-substituted analogs of novel tetrahydrofuranyl carbapenems.
AB  - CL 188,624, CL 190,294, and CL 191,121 are novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems. The in vitro antibacterial activities of these THF carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across North America. The antibacterial activities of the THF carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the THF carbapenems were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against Pseudomonas isolates. In general, CL 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than CL 188,624 and CL 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. CL 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than CL 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and E. faecalis. All the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. Biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against Bacteroides fragilis isolates. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the THF carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The postantibiotic effect exerted by CL 191,121 was comparable to or slightly longer than that of imipenem against isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine for 4 days after a single oral dose of 400 mg].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine after a single oral dose of 400 mg was evaluated in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected over six periods, i.e., 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, and 72-96 h postdose. Ofloxacin levels were assayed in all samples using a microbiological method and HPLC. Urinary ofloxacin MICs were determined for five bacterial strains recovered from urine, two E. coli strains of which one was susceptible and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), one Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), one Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain, and one Enterococcus faecalis strain; MICs were 0.06, 0.25, 1, 0.25, and 2 mg/L, respectively. Mean urinary ofloxacin levels by the microbiological method during the six collection periods were 193.3 +/- 30.3, 138.1 +/- 31, 53.2 +/- 7.3, 8.3 +/- 0.8, 1.4 +/- 0.2, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/L, respectively. HPLC provided similar results: 216.7 +/- 31.6, 130.7 +/- 20.5, 56.5 +/- 7.1, 8.3 +/- 0.9, 1.5 +/- 0.3, and 0.5 +/- 0.05 mg/L, respectively. Mean urinary ofloxacin excretion over 96 h was 67.4 +/- 3.6% of the dose by the microbiological method was 72.5 +/- 2.5% of the dose by HPLC. On the first day, bacteriostatic activity of urine against enterobacteria exceeded 32 and was greater than 8192 for the nalidixic acid-susceptible E. coli strain; on the next day, overall values were equal or greater than 8 for the nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. Bacteriostatic activity was equal to or greater than 32 for the S. saprophyticus strain during the first two days and equal to 8 on the first day and 4 on the second day for the E. faecalis strain.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in the premature neonate.
AB  - We describe a series of 11 high-risk neonates with infective endocarditis (IE) in this retrospective review. Previously IE has rarely been diagnosed in newborns and is usually fatal. The frequency was 4.3 cases per 100 patients. Five patients survived. Microorganisms included gram positives such as S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram negatives such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Echocardiographic location of the lesions showed four left sided, five right sided, and two bilateral. We conclude that IE may be more common than previously described. Prompt diagnosis and treatment led to survival in 45% of our patients. Prospective studies are needed to identify patients at risk and to establish the true incidence of IE in high-risk neonates.
TI  - Interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a Lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  - The ability of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. A parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). Subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although the initial deposition rates of the two Candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. Accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. We have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 Enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, 22 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. The strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. Multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. The minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. MICs were determined by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller Hinton agar. The MICs of appropriate American Type Culture Collection control strains were determined. Based on the interpretative criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (USA), 87 per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. Of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. Two isolates (1 E. coli and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. The spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
TI  - The effect of pH on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  - Butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. It  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. To investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of pH and butyric acid concentrations. Six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus. At pH 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. At pH 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mM. The maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mM, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at pH values occurring in the stomach. Therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
TI  - Toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. The amounts of H2O2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of H2O2 produced. The more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of H2O2 production. In addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when H2O2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. However, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
TI  - Susceptibility survey of piperacillin/tazobactam and some beta-lactam comparators in Italy.
AB  - From September 1994 to March 1995 an Italian multicenter in vitro study to evaluate the susceptibility of piperacillin/tazobactam compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ampicillin/sulbactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated in 132 different hospitals, was undertaken. In total, 26,732 isolates were collected but only 25,266 aerobic bacteria were able to be evaluated (16,863 Gram-negative and 8,403 Gram-positive). Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated (25.9%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.9%). Piperacillin/tazobactam had a general spectrum of activity (84.8% susceptible strains) comparable to imipenem (87.9%), and was distinctly greater than ceftazidime (71.1%).
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. Urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. Enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the HPLC assay. The total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. The mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. The antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (UBT), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (E. coli ATCC 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). For the E. coli ATCC 25,922, the organism with the lowest MIC, median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. For the five uropathogens (with increasing MICs: K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis), the UBTs decreased in general, according to MICs, demonstrating the same relations of UBTs for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (P. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher UBTs than enoxacin. The minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (MUBC), as derived from urinary concentrations, and UBTs showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding MBCs as determined in Mueller Hinton broth. In conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as UBTs, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting UBTs followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). A dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. Only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. Therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated UTI could be worth testing.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - A mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  - A new method, called the mixed culture recovery (MCR) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable cells. The MCR method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. In repeated experiments with strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. These results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  - A 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. Antibacterial assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli imp- and a Candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. Screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position A (secondary amine), at the end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. Subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. The range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting the first-round active sublibraries. Pyridinopolyamine positions B (secondary benzylamine) and C (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. High-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18, and 21 with MICs of 1-5 microM against S. pyogenes and E. coli imp-. Using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position C and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position B with position D (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. Subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier II panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, S. pyogenes, S. pyogenes (wild-type), Streptomyces aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at MICs of 1-12 microM, whereas MICs for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were > 100 microM. These eight compounds were not active (> 100 microM) against fungus C. albicans.
TI  - Role of chemotherapeutic antagonism in opportunistic infections.
AB  - The most widely-known anti-tumor drugs often induce marked immunosuppression which can give rise to one or more sepses. Anti-infection measures immediately applied can sometimes prove largely ineffective or even useless, the patient dying not as a result of the spread of the tumour but as a direct consequence of opportunistic infection. We postulate that antagonism between anti-tumour and antimicrobial drugs may also play an important part in this. By way of illustration of this hypothesis, we have studied the action of a number of known inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis and of DNA-gyrases on certain strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms cultured in medium containing various concentrations of some of the best-known anti-tumour antimetabolites. The experimental data show that antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs can sometimes induce synergic or indifferent chemotherapeutic interactions with many bacteria, while in others the effect is antagonistic. In practice, the action of the drugs could lead to bacterial selectivity, which, in conjunction with immunosuppression and the presence of resistant strains, could favour the evolution of opportunistic infection.
TI  - Ofloxacin otic solution for treatment of otitis externa in children and adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution with those of Cortisporin otic solutions (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) in otitis externa in adults and children. DESIGN: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults. SETTING: Twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial. PATIENTS: A total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME). INTERVENTIONS: Ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 mL; children, 0.25 mL) twice daily or Cortisporin (adults, 0.2 mL; children, 0.15 mL) 4 times daily for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The ME subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. RESULTS: Cure was observed in 82% and 97% of CE adults and children treated with ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of CE adults and children treated with Cortisporin, respectively. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as Cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters in inhibiting bacterial migration along catheter surface.
AB  - Most cases of catheter-related urinary tract infection are probably caused by organisms that migrate from the urethral meatus-catheter interface along the external surface of the catheter into the bladder. To examine the ability of bladder catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin to inhibit bacterial migration along the external surface of the catheter, a novel in vitro bladder model was used. Compared with uncoated catheters, antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters significantly impeded the migration of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans (bacteriuria developed at a mean of 2-5 days vs. 9-34 days, respectively, after bacterial contamination of the catheter). Although production of zones of inhibition by coated catheters may provide some protection against infection, there was no correlation between the size of zones of inhibition and level of efficacy in inhibiting bacterial migration in vitro. Examination of the clinical efficacy of these antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters is prudent.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a C-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of CFC-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. CFC-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. CFC-222 was particularly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.2 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.39 microg/ml). Against Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (MIC90s for E. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). The in vitro activity of CFC-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence of horse serum. However, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. The in vivo protective efficacy of CFC-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by S. aureus. CFC-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this infection model, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - In-vitro microbiological assessment of a new penem, Men 10700.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of Men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. Men 10700 was most active against staphylococci and streptococci (MIC90 < 0.5 mg/L), slightly less active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (MIC90 0.5-2 mg/L), moderately active against Enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe Proteae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., clostridia and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 4-16 mg/L), and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterococcus faecium. Its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. Men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp.
TI  - Periodontal microflora of HIV infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in HIV seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. The subgingival microflora of 20 CDC II, 20 CDC III, 20 CDC IV/V and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. Four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the HIV infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus micros. However, HIV seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloaca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Clostridium difficile, Aspergillus fumigatus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma incognitum. The lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in HIV infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Urine bactericidal activity of pefloxacin versus norfloxacin in healthy female volunteers after a single 800-mg oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised crossover study the antibacterial activity of pefloxacin and norfloxacin was assessed in the urine after a single 800-mg oral dose in 14 healthy female volunteers. Pefloxacin demonstrated lower peak concentrations in the urine than norfloxacin (mean, 217.2 mg/l versus 492.9 mg/l as determined by the microbiological assay) but pefloxacin was present over a longer period of time in sufficient concentrations than norfloxacin. Mean urine levels of at least 2 mg/l were present for 7 days after pefloxacin administration and 2 days after norfloxacin administration as determined by the microbiological assay. Overall, the urinary recovery of pefloxacin and norfloxacin amounted to 49.3% and 25.1%, respectively, of the total administered dose. The average urine bactericidal activity against the five test organisms was as follows: against reference strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 susceptible to nalidixic acid (Nal-S) for 5 days with pefloxacin and 2 days with norfloxacin; against three clinical isolates, one strain each of E. coli resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-R), Klebsiella pneumoniae Nal-R, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, for 3 days with pefloxacin and 24 h with norfloxacin; and against a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis for 2 days with pefloxacin and 12 h with norfloxacin. In conclusion, pefloxacin as a single dose proved to have sufficiently high and long-lasting urine bactericidal activity against urinary pathogens. These findings support the results of a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials in patients with uncomplicated lower UTI, demonstrating a single oral dose of 800 mg pefloxacin to be as effective as a conventional treatment with comparative drugs.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - Intestinal perforation after suction lipoplasty: a case report and review of the  literature.
AB  - Intrabdominal penetration with intestinal perforation is a relatively uncommon complication after liposuction. Seven cases have been reported in the literature, with a mortality rate > 50%. Here we present a case of a perforated viscus after suction lipoplasty of the abdomen using the tumescent technique. Multiple small-bowel enterotomies were made with the suction cannula. It is our hope that a heightened awareness of this potentially life-threatening complication will promote early and aggressive diagnosis and treatment of liposuction patients who present with gastrointestinal complaints in the early postoperative period.
TI  - Risk of microbial contamination with multiple use of 5-fluorouracil vials.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. METHODS: Ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-FU were determined for each organism. Organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-FU (50 mg/ml) and, after timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees C. Plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. RESULTS: The MICs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-FU used by some clinics. After incubation in 5-FU for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis-were still viable. CONCLUSION: 5-FU has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-FU vials are used in multiple dose fashion.
TI  - Beta-lactam stability in frozen microdilution PASCO MIC panels using strains with known resistance mechanisms as biosensors.
AB  - The stability of amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem in PASCO (PASCO System, DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) frozen microdilution susceptibility panels stored for 16 weeks at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C was evaluated. The increase in MIC values for the five American-Type Culture Collection (ATCC) quality control strains for susceptibility testing recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and for 13 strains with different well-characterized resistance mechanisms was indicative of bioactivity deterioration. The overall agreement (+/- 1 twofold dilution) at purchase between the MIC values of PASCO frozen microdilution susceptibility panels and the standard agar dilution method was 97.7%. Minimum inhibitory concentration values for the associations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam remained unchanged for the study period at -70 degrees C. In contrast, a carbapenem bioactivity decrease was detected only with strains having well-characterized resistance mechanisms from the 12th week onwards. At -20 degrees C, antibiotic deterioration with these latter strains was observed earlier than with ATCC strains: the activity of meropenem and imipenem remained unchanged only for the first 2 weeks, while a loss of activity was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam at the 7th and 10th week, respectively. Cefepime was highly stable both at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C. Strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms should be used in routine quality control studies of antibiotic stability for susceptibility testing panels during the storage period.
TI  - Is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  - The regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for Escherichia coli. The clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. The addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except P. mirabilis. However, when clinical strains of E. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. There was no difference in growth rates of E. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. The ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - [Determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  - The determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. The methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. These beta-lactamases were obtained from Enterobacter cloacae P99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia M 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. The strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture were S. aureus M 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and E. faecalis M 2113, E. avium M 2091 and S. aureus M 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), E. coli M 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. When rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, E. coli M 1495 turned out more adequate. E. coli M 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.
TI  - Douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. Two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and (or) Pythium spp. in in vitro assays. A significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. Eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were Streptomyces, Streptoverticillium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, or Burkholderia species. The actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. Recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings from nursery and forest sites. Bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, Inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. Strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis.

Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli.

CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - [Emphysematous cystitis: a case report].
AB  - Emphysematous cystitis is a rare condition in which gas-forming organisms produce gas in the bladder wall and lumen. We present a case of emphysematous cystitis with neurogenic bladder. The patient was a 78-year-old man who complained of dysuria and lower abdominal soft mass. Urine culture yielded Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. A plain X-ray film of upright position showed a large air-fluid level. The gas was demonstrated in the bladder wall and lumen on CT scan. These findings were compatible with that of emphysematous cystitis. The symptoms were improved and the intraluminal gas had disappeared on radiography after treatment with antibiotics. We reviewed 20 cases of emphysematous cystitis reported in the Japanese literature and reported clinical characteristics of 21 patients including ours here.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef (FMOX). Sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. Sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with E. coli and K. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. Therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against Streptococcus pneumoniae. While its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of imipenem/cilastatin against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and A. calcoaceticus.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit secondary to Enterococcus fecalis.
AB  - Bacteremia is often a serious and recurring problem in children with hemodialysis catheters. We report an outbreak of Enterococcus bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit occurring from June 1992 to June 1993. During this period, 18 episodes of bacteremia occurred in eight children; 11 infections were polymicrobial. Enterococcus fecalis was associated with 13 infections in five patients (8 polymicrobial). Other pathogens included Enterobacter cloacae (5 infections), Staphylococcus (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). All Enterococcus infections occurred in patients with dual-lumen subclavian venous catheters. Skin and catheter sites were culture negative, except in one patient. Rectal swabs were positive for Enterococcus in five patients. Enterococcus was not isolated from any source within the unit. Serotypes of all Enterococcus isolates were different, except for 2 isolates in the same patient. Starting in June 1993, catheters were flushed after dialysis with vancomycin or ampicillin. Since initiating this procedure, further episodes of Enterococcus bacteremia have not occurred. A questionnaire sent to other pediatric hemodialysis units failed to identify Enterococcus among 26 cases of bacteremia. IN CONCLUSION: (1) Enterococcus is an unusual pathogen for hemodialysis-related bacteremia in children; (2) patients with dialysis catheters were predisposed to this infection; (3) a common source for Enterococcus could not be identified by either culture or by serotyping; (4) flushing catheters with antibiotics after dialysis was effective prevention.
TI  - [Phenotypic differences of nosocomial bacterial strains isolated in the obstetric-gynecology service of the University Hospital Center of Dakar].
AB  - A study on nosocomial infections was conducted in the Laboratory of Bacteriology-Virology of Aristide Le Dantec's Hospital, in collaboration with the Gynecology Obstetrics clinic located both in the same Dakar's hospital, during May 1995. The aim of the study was to define the phenotypical characteristics of various bacterial strains isolated from the atmosphere health care staff's hands, medical equipment (material, antiseptics) and patients (hospitalized pregnant and newborns in day Nursery). A total of 133 strains were collected and the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (27 strains) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 strains) encountered mainly in the atmosphere. Otherwise, Escherichia coli (11 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) were more present in hospitalized patients. Results obtained after antimicrobial agents susceptibility (Antibiotics and Heavy metal salts) by Antibiogramm and Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and also data from biotyping of Klebsiella strains have allowed us to say there's a probable contamination of hospitalized patients by the bacteria from the atmosphere but manuportage too.

TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - Microflora associated with percutaneous craniofacial implants used for the retention of facial prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  - Craniofacial implants have been used successfully for the retention of facial prostheses. However, complications occur that can lead to the loss of implant integration. One such complication is infection possibly resulting from crevicular microflora activity. As part of an ongoing study, samples from crevicular sites surrounding 17 craniofacial implants were collected and submitted for microbiological assay. The results demonstrated the presence of opportunistic pathogens in many sites regardless of subjects' hygiene efforts. The significance of the findings is reviewed.

Isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were tested. Excluding E. cloacae, 28 of 32 sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related PFGE types. Four of the seven sets of E. cloacae showed different types. For species other than E. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. Unlike all of the other tested species, E. cloacae PFGE typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.
TI  - Factitious disorder presenting as bacteremia. Case report and literature review.
AB  - A factitious disorder is typically a chronic illness that can be frustrating for  the clinical team because it often eludes early diagnosis. Case reports in the literature show that patients can simulate almost any illness or disease state with some resorting to injecting themselves with contaminated substances to produce infection. A case is reported of a patient with self-induced bacteremia who presented with multiple episodes of polymicrobial bloodstream infections. The various types of factitious disorders and a review of treatment options are discussed. The current criteria for factitious disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) 4th edition are reviewed.
TI  - A randomised comparison of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of bacterial  infections in paediatric patients.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of isepamicin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or amikacin the same dosage regimen for the treatment of various infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic paediatric patients were compared in a prospective randomised trial. In total, 306 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of randomised treatment (204 isepamicin, 102 amikacin: intent-to-treat population); 181 patients satisfied all criteria for evaluability (120 isepamicin, 61 amikacin: efficacy population). Clinical cure or improvement rates in the isepamicin and amikacin groups were: intent-to-treat population, 188/204 (92%) and 94/102 (92%), respectively; efficacy population, 117/120 (98%) and 58/61 (95%), respectively. The bacteriological elimination rate (efficacy population) in the isepamicin and amikacin treatment groups was 75/76 (99%) vs 35/38 (92%). Nephrotoxicity, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or > or = 44.2 mumol/L from baseline, occurred in 4/187 (2%) and 1/191 (1%) children treated with isepamicin and amikacin, respectively. Definite ototoxicity at the > or = 20 dB threshold occurred in 3 (1 isepamicin and 2 amikacin) out of 56 children evaluated with at least two audiograms. Thus isepamicin was as effective and as well tolerated as amikacin in the treatment of various infections in paediatric patients.
TI  - Experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  - The immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator Urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. The preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. It consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: Escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, Rc mutant of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis, BALB/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with Urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. A stimulatory effect of Urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. An increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. Lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. At the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. An active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by Gram-negative bacteria was obtained. In conclusion, the results obtained characterize Urostim as an effective immunostimulator. Its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains isolated from children in Child Health Center, Warsaw.
AB  - This study examines the antibiotic susceptibility of 1792 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized children between January and December 1993. A total of 1015 Gram-negative rods represented by members of Enterobacteriaceae family (770) and nonfermenters (245) were isolated. The most resistant strains were noticed among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. From 38% to 46% of K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, but all of them were sensitive to imipenem. From 60% to 80% of E. cloacae isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, but sensitive to imipenem. Resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides varied from 30% for gentamicin to 5% for amikacin. About 40% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to carbenicillin, and 25% to azlocillin and piperacillin, but only two strains were resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem. Among Gram-positive cocci the most frequently encountered were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. The methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus consisted 74.8% and 34%, respectively. All strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus were sensitive to vancomycin.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - Rapid identification of common human pathogens by high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - Routine procedures for recovery of bacteria from clinical specimens involve culturing the latter on various nonselective and selective agar media. The bacteria are then identified by means of biochemical and immunological test procedures. Reduction of the time required to identify the bacteria is highly desirable for rapid clinical diagnosis. Towards this end the potential of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for providing a "fingerprint" within the proton spectrum of five bacterial genera, reflecting their characteristic cell wall constituents, has been investigated. Establishing a database of high-resolution proton NMR spectra of a large number of bacterial species is a prerequisite for attaining this objective. A database has been established for five common human pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. On the basis of the presence of characteristic resonances in their spectra, a simple algorithm has been developed to differentiate and identify these microorganisms. The NMR spectra of E. coli and S. aureus showed no dependency on the type of growth medium, growth density, or incubation time.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - Environmental contamination by organisms causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - We have examined the bedsheets, floor and bedside chairs of 33 patients with urinary tract infections for organisms causing urinary infection. In ten patients the causative organism was recovered from the undersheet, and in two of these it was also recovered from the floor and bedside chair. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered from sheets, while Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci and Candida tropicalis were also found on floors and chairs.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - Effects of silver on adherence of bacteria to urinary catheters: in vitro studies.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. The relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. For strains of E. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. Antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. The radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.
TI  - Differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  - The short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. In addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. The results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. On the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. Escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while Aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. This different order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. Thus, the low digestion rates of Ent. faecalis and Staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric Gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on combined effects of fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone for mixed infections of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - The time-lag/sequential/step by step chemotherapy by fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone including a short time small dose of steroid was done for 27 severely infected patients suffered from various cancer or other severe basal diseases. And the staggered "intensive" chemotherapy with added arbekacin or vancomycin to the previous staggered chemotherapy was done against 13 severely infected patients having MRSAs among their infecting pathogens. 1. Bacteriological effects Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6/8, Staphylococcus epidermidis 5/5, Enterococcus faecalis 3/6, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 2/2, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2/2, MRSA 2/2, Xanthomonas maltophilia 2/3 and other 10/10 were eradicated (84.2%) by the staggered chemotherapy and MRSA 7/13, P. aeruginosa 3/4, E. faecalis 3/5, A. calcoaceticus 2/2, X. maltophilia 1/1 and others 2/2 were eradicated (53.8% in MRSA, 78.6% in others and 66.7% in total) and 3 of MRSAs were colonized. 2. Clinical effects 1) Staggered chemotherapy: Excellent 18/27, good 8/27, fair 1/27, poor 0/27 (96.3%). 2) Staggered "intensive" chemotherapy: Excellent 6/13, good 4/13, fair 2/13, poor 1/13 (76.9%) in total: excellent 60.0%, efficacy rate 90.0%.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin in the urine during four days after a single 500 mg and 750 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 500 mg and 750 mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected, after each single oral dose, during seven time periods: 0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were assayed by microbiological method. Urine antibacterial activity was determined for five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 E. coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Enterococcus faecalis. MICs of ciprofloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.003, 0.06, 0.25, 0.06 and 0.5 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin mean concentrations in the seven urine samples were 292.5 +/- 55.8, 81.1 +/- 16.9, 43.7 +/- 11.6, 11.5 +/- 1.9, 1.3 +/- 0.2, 0.3 +/- 0.05 et 0.1 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml after a single 500 mg oral dose and 215.1 +/- 68.1, 56.1 +/- 17.8, 43 +/- 8.8, 14.4 +/- 5.5, 1.4 +/- 0.2, 0.4 +/- 0.1 and 0.2 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml after a single 750 mg oral dose. Urine bacteriostatic activity was not very different after a 500 mg dose and a 750 mg dose. Against enterobacteriacae, after a 500 mg dose it was > or = 16 the first day; it was > or = 512 for the Nal-S E. coli. It was > or = 64 the first day, and remained between 2 and 32 the second day for the Nal-R strains (E. coli and Klebsiella).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Contaminated rabbit patellar tendon grafts. In vivo analysis of disinfecting methods.
AB  - In Part 1 of our study, 40 central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts were harvested from 20 adult California White rabbits under strict sterile conditions. Ten grafts were placed directly into a thioglycolate broth, incubated, and subcultured; no growth was noted in any specimen. The next 6 grafts were contaminated 20 seconds each with 2 different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Organisms were grown with cultures obtained from an operating room floor during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Marked growth of both species was noted in all 6 grafts within 24 hours. A subsequent 3 series of 8 grafts each were harvested sterilely, contaminated as described above, and soaked in 1 of 3 solutions 30 minutes before culture. Both 10% povidone-iodine and a triple-antibiotic solution (gentamicin, clindamycin, polymyxin) were 100% ineffective as both organisms grew; 4% chlorhexidine gluconate effectively decontaminated 8 grafts in all cases. Part 2 involved contamination of harvested grafts with 5 common, virulent organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Elimination of all except Klebsiella pneumoniae was successful with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate alone for 8 grafts. Using a triple-antibiotic solution after chlorhexidine gluconate in 6 grafts eliminated this organism also.

TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin (TFLX) was compared with those of other new quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin) against clinical isolates. These isolates had been collected from May to June 1993 (22 species, 260 strains) and from June to July 1992 (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 87 strains) in Toyama municipal hospital. TFLX showed the most potent activities against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in 1993, at MIC50 levels. The MIC50's of TFLX for these species ranged from 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml. TFLX showed potent activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the MIC50's of TFLX were 0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. However, new quinolone resistant strains (MIC > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml) were found among some species. Especially, the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains resistant to new quinolone exceeded 60% of all the S. aureus isolates in 1993. More MRSA strains resistant to new quinolones were isolated in 1993 than in 1992, and similar result was observed for P. aeruginosa. The coagulase typing was done, and all MRSA strains of resistant to new quinolones produced coagulase type II.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Survey of bacteraemia in a Spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  - The aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a Spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. A total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). A slight increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. The most frequent species (annual range) were: Escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), Klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). Males were more affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). The portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). Bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. The hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - [Staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. Bacteriologic aspects].
AB  - Struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. Ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. Incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. This trial examines the bacteriologic aspects pre and post-ESWL. Eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (UTI) were submitted to urine cultures pre and post-ESWL. The first 50 patients underwent during and post-ESWL, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of generalized sepsis. No patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. With respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-ESWL UTI, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a UTI post-ESWL. The distribution of organisms pre and post-ESWL was as follows: Proteus mirabilis (22/22), Escherichia coli (11/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), Enterobacter cloacae (0/1), Alcaligenes odorans (1/2) Enterococcus faecalis (1/3), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and Candida albicans (1/1). In this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-ESWL probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. According to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. In 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial infection.
TI  - Incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  - Urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in Oklahoma. Of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were: Escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), Pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Providencia stuartii (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of P. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting P. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [A clinical study of lomefloxacin on the patients with urinary tract infections--focused on lomefloxacin-induced photosensitivity reaction].
AB  - Between April and October 1990, photosensitivity reactions were observed in 19 out of 338 patients who were administered lomefloxacin (LFLX) for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) in our hospital. To certify the effectiveness and safety of LFLX to UTI, we carried out a controlled study with fixed dosages and durations. Patients with acute uncomplicated UTI and chronic complicated UTI were enrolled and LFLX dosages of 200 mg b.i.d. for 7 days and 14 days, respectively, were administered. The overall efficacy rates were 100% and 84% respectively. Concerning the bacteriological effect, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated in every case, while 3 strains of Enterococcus faecalis 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of Enterobacter cloacae persisted. No photosensitivity reaction or noteworthy severe adverse reactions were observed among 200 cases enrolled in this study of restricted dosages and durations. We, urologists, need to be well-informed about photosensitivity reactions induced by quinolone antimicrobial agents. LFLX was proven to be effective in UTI without showing any photosensitivity reactions when administered by our fixed dosages and durations.
TI  - Effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. The blood was inoculated with one of five species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per mL. The growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees C storage period of the platelet concentrates. One species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, failed to grow in any of the components. The remaining species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by Day 3. Although the concentration of bacteria immediately after inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. Data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Salicylic acid prevents the adherence of bacteria and yeast to silastic catheters.
AB  - During the pathogenesis of catheter-related urinary tract infection, bacteria attach to the catheter and migrate along a biofilm into the bladder. We studied the effect of coating silastic catheters with salicylic acid on bacterial and yeast adherence. An agar roll technique, bioluminescent assay, and radiolabeling study all produced consistent results. There was a dose related inhibition of adherence with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, and Enterococcus faecalis. Inhibition of over 90% was noted with Enterobacter and Pseudomonas. Similar results were obtained in broth and synthetic urine. A dose related reduction in adherence was seen with all gram-negative rods and yeast as measured by a radiolabeling assay. TDMAC was used to bind the salicylic acid to the catheters with > 95% inhibition of the gram-negative rods. These studies suggest the potential role of coating catheters with salicylic acid to reduce bacterial adherence and urinary tract infection.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Optimal method for culturing vascular prosthetic grafts.
AB  - Vascular prosthetic infection may be underrecognized when identified by standard  culture techniques. Improved microbiologic methodology may enhance detection of bacteria in prosthetic graft specimens, and thus may alter clinical decisions. Quantitative culture techniques were employed to compare three methods of enhancing bacterial recovery from Dacron graft cylinders seeded with commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. Methods included: (1) ultrasonic bath treatment, (2) direct ultrasonic disruption, and (3) agitation on a Vortex mixer. Ultrasonic bath treatment released bacteria with colony counts that were consistently greater by 1 log than direct ultrasonic disruption and Vortex agitation. Direct ultrasonic disruption at high energy levels selectively killed gram-negative bacteria by as much as a 4 log decrease in viable organisms. Agitation (Vortex mixing) of the specimen produced the lowest counts among the three methods tested. These data would indicate that a 5-min ultrasonic bath treatment was the optimal method of preparation of vascular prostheses for bacterial culture.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (CEZ) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) CFU/ml. The reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using Mueller-Hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) CFU/cm2 in estimating approximate values of MICs. In addition, antimicrobial activities of CEZ and cefmetazole (CMZ) or flomoxef (FMOX) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) using the checkerboard agar dilution MIC method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained CEZ, CMZ, and FMOX alone, or CEZ, and CMZ or FMOX in combination. In this study, the MICs of CEZ against S. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. MICs against MSSA were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against MRSA were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. MICs against majority of strains of Enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. Over 90% of strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. About 60% of isolates of indole negative Proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but MICs against indole positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. The antimicrobial activities of CEZ against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for S. aureus. Highly resistant strains of S. aureus to CEZ were more prevalent in this study. The inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with MICs. The results of CEZ disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (Showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, break points in MIC values proposed are () MIC < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. The disk results with E. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - A descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  - Out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. Of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while Escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. The most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (30 cultures), E. faecalis-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (28), E. faecalis-P. aeruginosa (13), K. pneumoniae-P. aeruginosa (9), and E. coli-P. aeruginosa (9).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E1077 for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), E1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. The MIC90S of E1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; E1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. E1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa. In general, the antibacterial profile of E1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Microflora of the pouch of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  - Microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. No microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of 17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). Growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. Seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. Based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin alone and in combination in healthy elderly volunteers.
AB  - To better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents in the elderly, six healthy (greater than 65 years) volunteers with normal renal function were given ciprofloxacin alone orally, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin orally, ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin orally, rifampin alone orally (three volunteers), and, for comparison of SBA against gram-positive cocci, vancomycin intravenously. Mean peak ciprofloxacin concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered significantly by coadministration of either rifampin or clindamycin. Ciprofloxacin had somewhat greater SBA against the oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains tested than did vancomycin, but rifampin was by far the most active single agent tested. The SBA of rifampin against S. aureus was modestly antagonized during combination therapy with ciprofloxacin, but substantial SBA still was present. The ciprofloxacin SBA against S. aureus was completely antagonized by clindamycin if the strains were susceptible to the latter agent. Ciprofloxacin had modest SBA against group A streptococci and no SBA against the three pneumococcal strains tested. All of the regimens had poor to absent SBA against Enterococcus faecalis. By contrast, ciprofloxacin had excellent SBA against Escherchia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and moderate SBA against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combination therapy with rifampin or clindamycin in general enhanced the SBA against the nonenterococcal streptococci and had no effect on the SBA against the gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [An electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  - Transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei and Edwardsiella tarda. Different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. For the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses by E. coli indigenous strains M-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. This observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - In vitro studies with Bay V 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Bay v 3522, cefaclor, cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate (2:1) and reference penicillins were compared against 314 clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and nine strains of Escherichia coli that differed in their outer membrane proteins in agar dilution tests with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot. The beta-lactamase stabilities of the cephalosporins were also evaluated by spectrophotometric assay using 21 different beta-lactamases. Bay v 3522 was the most potent cephalosporin overall against Gram-positive pathogens, but slightly less active than amoxicillin/clavulanate. In addition to being highly active against streptococci (MIC90 = 0.25 micrograms/ml) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml), Bay v 3522 was markedly more active than the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 4 micrograms/ml). Bay v 3522 was less potent against Gram-negative pathogens, especially nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 greater than 64 micrograms/ml), but was active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and beta-lactamase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml0. Hydrolysis of Bay v 3522 by most beta-lactamases examined was significantly less than that observed for cephalothin and cefaclor; similar to that observed with cephalexin; and less than that observed with cefixime and cefuroxime. None of the beta-lactamases examined hydrolysed Bay v 3522 at a rate greater than 20 nmol/min/mg. The in vitro potency of Bay v 3522 against Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens and its resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases produced by them support further investigation of this cephalosporin as a new oral therapeutic agent.
TI  - Endophthalmitis from contaminated donor corneas following penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - We encountered six (0.2%) cases of endophthalmitis resulting from contaminated donor corneas between January 1983 and July 1990 following a total of 3000 consecutive penetrating keratoplasties. Causative organisms in the three cases of fungal endophthalmitis were Torulopsis glabrata, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus flavus; the three cases of bacterial endophthalmitis were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. All organisms were resistant to gentamicin in the preservation media. A significantly higher incidence of endophthalmitis was noted in patients receiving corneas from a Sri Lankan eye bank (1.25%) than in those receiving US eye bank tissue (0.14%). Donor rim cultures are important to identify those patients at increased risk of developing endophthalmitis, enabling earlier diagnosis and more specific treatment should endophthalmitis occur.
TI  - Spontaneous contrast in the pericardial sac caused by gas-forming organisms.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with a variety of  microorganisms. The case presented herein has unusual manifestations of contrast echoes on two-dimensional echocardiography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pericarditis caused by gas-forming group D Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae with pyopericardium, resulting in contrast echoes on the two-dimensional echocardiographic image.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Clinical study of S 6472 in urinary tract infection].
AB  - Clinical studies on S 6472, a longer lasting preparation of cefaclor (CCL), were  performed and the following results were obtained. S 6472 was administered orally to 102 patients with urinary tract infections including 16 with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, 32 with acute uncomplicated cystitis, 31 with complicated pyelonephritis and 23 with complicated cystitis. 95 patients were treated with 375 mg of S 6472 2 times daily and 7 patients were treated with 750 mg of S 6472 2 times daily. The overall clinical efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the criteria proposed by the Japanese UTI Committee. 1. Clinical efficacies in 11 cases of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were excellent in 10 and moderate in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, all 12 strains identified in the acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis cases were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 100%. 2. Clinical efficacies in 21 cases of acute uncomplicated cystitis were excellent in 17, moderate in 3 and poor in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 95%. As to bacteriological responses, 22 strains identified in the acute uncomplicated cystitis cases (except 1 of Escherichia coli) were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 95%. 3. Clinical responses in 43 cases of complicated urinary tract infections were excellent in 20, moderate in 15 and poor in 8, with an overall efficacy rate of 81%. Bacteriologically, 39 strains, including only one strain of P. aeruginosa, in the complicated urinary tract infection cases (except 4 of E. coli, 1 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis and 2 of Enterobacter cloacae) were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 83%. As side effects, slight stomatitis and gastric discomfort were noted in 1 patient each but we were able to continue the medication. Abnormal laboratory test values found were: 1 case of a slight and transient increase of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and 1 case of a slight and transient increase of serum creatinine level.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Quantitative changes in faecal microflora preceding necrotising enterocolitis in  premature neonates.
AB  - Quantitative studies of faecal bacterial flora were carried out during the week preceding the clinical onset of 12 episodes of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. There were considerable quantitative changes in the faecal flora preceding the clinical onset of both definite and possible episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. There was a decline in the numbers of some species from up to 72 hours before the clinical onset of the disease. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from samples collected during the 48 hours preceding the clinical onset of all four definite episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. These were 'new' isolates in two episodes, and considerably increased numbers in another. The changes that we found are probably the result of changes in intraluminal conditions that precede the clinical onset of necrotising enterocolitis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The role of Escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  - The growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (E. coli, Ent. faecalis, B. ovatis, F. varium and C. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when the E. coli strain was haemolytic. E. coli and B. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. When non-haemolytic E. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. The inclusion of partially purified E. coli haemolysin (125 HU50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic E. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. These results indicate that E. coli haemolysin is one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between E. coli and B. ovatus, during abscess formation.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Since 1979, Ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. Their findings for the past year are reported below. A total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. Of this total, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and Gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). Taxonomically, Escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), Enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), Klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). Sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. E. faecalis was sensitive to parenteral imipenem (IPM) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. It was also sensitive to ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX), which are new quinolones. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefuzonam (CZON) aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK) and arbekacin (HBK), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to dicloxacillin (MDIPC) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (CTM) which is a cephem, IPM, minocycline (MINO), and HBK. A fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (CEZ), OFLX and CPFX. 3. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to MDIPC which is a penicillin derivative, cephems CTM and CZON, IPM, HBK, clindamycin (CLDM) and MINO. Some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. E. coli was sensitive to CTM, CMX, latamoxef (LMOX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZON, and flomoxef (FMOX), all of which are second or third generation cephems. It was also sensitive to IPM, a carbapenem, carumonam (CRMN), a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. 5. K. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. CTM, CAZ, CZON, FMOX and cefixime, CRMN which is a monobactam, IPM, a carbapenem and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to CTM, cefmetazole cefoperazone (CPZ), and FMOX. 6. Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to CRMN which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. CEZ, CTM, CPZ and CAZ. 7. Enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and AMK which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to CPZ, CAZ and CZON, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, OFLX and CPFX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies of aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Absorption and excretion of aztreonam (AZT) in neonates were studied and its clinical evaluation in 10 cases of neonates was performed using 1 hour intravenous drip infusion. 1. Serum concentrations of AZT in 7 neonates younger than 11 days of age were lower than those in infants. 2. Serum concentrations of AZT in 5 neonates given 20 mg/kg reached their peaks at the end of intravenous drip infusion with an average value of 45.8 +/- 10.41 micrograms/ml, and T 1/2 was 2.77 +/- 0.32 hours on the average. 3. Serum concentrations of AZT in 2 neonates given AZT 25 mg/kg reached their peaks at the end of intravenous drip infusion at 31.1 and 33.4 micrograms/ml with little difference from the 20 mg/kg group. Half-lives of serum AZT in the 2 cases were 1.87 hours and 3.23 hours, respectively. 4. Urinary excretion rates of AZT in 7 neonates younger than 11 days of age in the first 6 to 8 hours after the administration were 18.8 to 50.0%, or 31.7% on the average, which was lower than the average excretion rate found with infants. 5. All the cases given AZT showed clinical results rated better than "effective". Effect of AZT was excellent on 3 UTI cases caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but bacterial replacement (superinfection) of Enterococcus faecalis was observed when AZT was administered. 6. Transient elevations of GOT and GPT were seen in 2 cases when AZT administration was continued at length. Clinical side effect was not observed. 7. The most appropriate dosage and administration scheme of AZT against Gram-negative infections in neonates seems to be 40-60 mg/kg/day, b.i.d. or t.i.d.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. I. Development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. Formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) is the major chemotactic peptide in Escherichia coli culture supernatants. This paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (RIA) for FMLP and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. The assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/L FMLP) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with F-met-leu-tyr, F-nle-leu-phe and F-met-met-met sequences (ID50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/L, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (ID50 = 10(5) nmol/L. Culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography before RIA. All five organisms produced immunoreactive F-met peptides. A major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic FMLP was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in Streptococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis cultures. In E. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive FMLP increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth reaching 31.2 nmol/L(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/mL (n = 6). These findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a RIA for FMLP will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of papain on facultative pathogens--short communication.
AB  - Papain, a proteolytic enzyme obtained from papaya was found inhibitory on few facultative pathogens. While Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus albus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited at concentration from 200 ppm on the cell density of Staphylococcus faecalis decreased only at higher concentration of papain (400-800 ppm).
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against Bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides species. In order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant Bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.) were tested. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the associated culture as a whole. In the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the MBCs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to MBCs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in single strain testing.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - [Biliary excretion and clinical efficacy of T-3262 (tosufloxacin tosilate) administered in the treatment of cholecystitis].
AB  - T-3262 (tosufloxacin tosilate), a new oral pyridone carboxylic acid agent, was investigated for its biliary excretion and clinical efficacy and safety to evaluate its usefulness in the treatment of cholecystitis. T-3262 was administered to a total of 4 healthy volunteers for 2 days at a dose of 150 mg every 8 hours, and A-, B- or C-bile were collected using the MELTZER-LYON method at 10-11 hours after the final administration. Bile concentrations of T-3262 in 3 cases were 0.33-2.05 micrograms/ml (A-bile), 6.13-9.50 micrograms/ml (B-bile) and 1.11-2.70 micrograms/ml (C-bile). Thus, T-3262 levels in B-bile were 15-34 times higher than serum levels (0.28-0.41 micrograms/ml). Only a trace of serum concentration of T-3262 was detected in another case with the concentration in B-bile was 0.132 micrograms/ml. A total of 10 patients with cholecystitis were treated with T-3262 at a dose level of 150 mg per dose 3 times daily for 1 to 20 days. The clinical efficacy was excellent in 1 case, good in 5 cases and fair in 2 cases and unevaluable in 2 cases, thus the clinical efficacy rate was 75%. Bacteriologically, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus were isolated from biles of 3 patients before treatment. Upon the treatment, E. faecalis was eradicated and K. pneumoniae was unchanged. The fate of H. parahaemolyticus was not known because of examination was not done after treatment. Side effects were observed in 2 cases with diarrhea in 1 case and epigastric pain in another case. But those symptoms disappeared after cessation of administration of T-3262. Abnormal laboratory test values were not observed.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - In 1986 the allowable platelet storage time was reduced from 7 to 5 days because  of a recent increase in septic deaths associated with platelet transfusion. In this study, the growth curves of two gram-positive and two gram-negative organisms in platelets stored for 7 days in CLX and PL-732 bags were evaluated. Platelets in CLX bags were inoculated with 10(1), 10(2), and 10(3) organisms and 10(2) organisms were introduced into PL-732 bags. Test organisms were inoculated into trypticase soy broth as a control. All four bacteria grew rapidly in trypticase soy broth, reaching 10(9) organisms per mL within 48 hours. In both CLX and PL-732 bags, the growth pattern of gram-positive organisms was generally logarithmic during the first few days of storage. A concentration of 10(8) organisms per mL was present by Day 3 or 4, after which further proliferation was inhibited by the high density of bacteria in the platelets. In PL-732 bags, the proliferation of gram-negative organisms followed a pattern similar to that of the gram-positive bacteria. However, gram-negative organisms grew less well in CLX bags.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of QA-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to QA-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. The MICs of QA-241 for 90% of staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of QA-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, QA-241 inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii. QA-241 was moderately active (MIC for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against S. marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antibacterial activity of QA-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. In systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of QA-241 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In urinary tract infections in mice with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QA-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. In pulmonary infections in mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of QA-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of novel 5-fluoro analogues of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - A series of polyfluoro-3-quinolonecarboxylic acids have been synthesized and their in vitro antibacterial activity evaluated. The desired 7-(substituted amino) derivatives were prepared from the 5,6,7,8-tetrafluoroquinolone acids. Conversely, amine displacement occurred primarily at the 5-position when the ester was used. Structure-activity studies indicated that the antibacterial activity was greatest when the N-1 substituent was cyclopropyl and the 7-substituent was 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl. All 5-(substituted amino) derivatives showed poor in vitro activity.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin in the urine during the 4 days following  a single 400 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin was studied in the urine after single dose of 400 mg in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 7 periods: 0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h. Lomefloxacin concentration were assayed in all samples by microbiological method. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis. MIC's of lomefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.06, 0.50, 0.50, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin mean concentrations were 208.5 +/- 44.2, 104.3 +/- 15.2, 100.5 +/- 17.9, 36.8 +/- 8.2, 9.6 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples. Low levels were present in urine the 4th day. Mean urine elimination percentage was 62.2 +/- 4.2% for the four days, with extreme values from 91.2 to 41.8%. Urine bacteriostatic activity against enterobacteriacae was greater than or equal to 32 the first day reaching 8,192 for the Nal-S E. Coli, it was greater than or equal to 4 the second day. Against staphylococcus it was greater than or equal to 64 the first day, greater than or equal to 16 the second day. Against enterococcus it was greater than or equal to 4 the first day. Against the strains implicated in UTI a bacteriostatic activity was present during 2 days in all subjects.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin in the urine during the 7 days following a  single 800 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 800  mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 9 periods: 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-28 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h, 96-120 h, 120-144 h, 144-168 h. Pefloxacin concentrations were assayed in all samples by a microbiological method and by HPLC. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis; MIC's of pefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.015, 0.25, 1, 0.50 and 2 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin mean concentrations as determined by the microbiological method were 91.8 +/- 11.9, 71.7 +/- 7, 44.5 +/- 4.3, 24.4 +/- 4 and 5.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples; low levels were present in the urine until the 7th day in 8 volunteers. HPLC results completed the already known data concerning pefloxacin elimination and metabolism; unchanged pefloxacin was excreted at the highest concentration during the 6 first hours; then demethylpefloxacin was eliminated at higher levels than pefloxacin with a ratio of 2/1 after the 24th hour. These two compounds were detectable in the urine during 5 to 7 days; oxodemethylpefloxacin and N-oxyde-pefloxacin were present in lower amounts and during a shorter period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  - Sulbactam/Cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in Japan and U.S.A., respectively. After an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of CPZ and SBT in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. In urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. Antimicrobial interaction studies using various combinations of CPZ and SBT were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of SBT on the antimicrobial activity of CPZ in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. Antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. SBT increased the activity of CPZ against various clinical isolates tested except Enterococcus faecalis. CPZ-SBT at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of CPZ, resulting in decreases in MIC values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. These drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. Therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. Based on pharmacokinetic data for CPZ and SBT, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of CPZ-SBT at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in Japan and U.S.A., respectively, are appropriate. The effect of SBT on the activity of CPZ was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. SBT/CPZ, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum size were as follows: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, Staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and E. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. Those of Gram-negative bacilli were: Escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, Proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, Serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and Acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.
TI  - [Studies of lomefloxacin in biliary tract infections].
AB  - Lomefloxacin (NY-198), a new antimicrobial quinolone, was examined for its antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates and clinical efficacies to biliary tract infections. The following results were obtained. 1. The MICs of NY-198 against Escherichia coli (20 strains) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains) were good and similar to those of ofloxacin (OFLX) or norfloxacin (NFLX). The MICs of NY-198 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 strains) were inferior by 1 dilution factor to OFLX or NFLX, and against Enterococcus faecalis (10 strains), they were similar to NFLX and slightly inferior to OFLX. 2. NY-198 was administered to 8 patients with biliary tract infections (acute cholecystitis 7 cases, chronic cholangitis 1 case). The results were good in 7 and unevaluable in 1 case because the duration of the therapy was too short. 3. As for side effects, mild urticaria was observed in 1 case and epigastralgia with nausea in another. As for abnormal laboratory test values slight elevations of GOT and GPT were recognized in 1 case. 4. In conclusion, we consider NY-198 is a useful oral drug for the treatment of biliary tract infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.

TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  - A simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. The activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with EDTA + Tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. Except for phenoxyethanol against Pv. stuartii and possibly Ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. However, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate Ps. aeruginosa. It is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

AB  - An improved procedure for separating and quantitating carbohydrates, alcohols, and organic acids in fermentation mixtures metabolized by intestinal microflora is described. The high-pressure liquid chromatographic method is efficient, reproducible, and sensitive. A column packed with cation-exchange resin in the hydrogen form, eluted isocratically with 0.028 M H2SO4 at 40 degrees C separates the compounds of interest. The eluate is monitored with ultraviolet and refractive index detectors in series. On-line acquistion and storage of detector output by a computer allows post-analysis data manipulation and quantitation. Using this method, the metabolic profiles for the fermentation of glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose by several intestinal microorganisms are characterized and compared.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Urinary tract infections are among the most common infections found in women. If  recurrences or reinfections become frequent treatment can be problematic. Immunisation of the patients by vaccinating them against urinary tract pathogens offers a possibility of managing these infections. In clinical trials we tested SolcoUrovac, a new vaccine to counteract bacterial pathogens, with regard to efficacy, frequency of recurrence, and tolerance. 113 of the 118 patients included in this study with bacteriuria (urine culture germ count greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml), had acute cystitis. 47 of these patients had recurring urinary tract infections. Follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months. A urine culture assay was performed during each examination, as well as a relevant bacterial differentiation test and a urine sediment evaluation. Two to six weeks after termination of the vaccination series 72.6% of the patients were largely free from signs and symptoms. The rate of recurrence/reinfection dropped from 2.5 to 0.24 infections for a period of 12 months. After one year, 94 of the patients (80%) were still free from reinfection.

Sewage sludges at different treatment stages and the digested sludge were studied for their content of pathogenic bacteria. Two Gram-positive cocci and eight Gram-negative bacilli were isolated and enumerated in the sewage sludges and in raw sewage. During March, Aeromonas hydrophila was the dominant bacterium isolated. Serratia liquefaciens in raw sewage and sludge-2, and Salmonella species in digested sludge were dominant during April. Enterobacter aerogenes was dominant in sewage samples in May. Various types of bacteria isolated were tested for their sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics.

AB  - 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15N2]-urea and [15N]-ammonium chloride. The rates of [15N]-incorporation were calculated. They depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered NPN-substance and on the amount of NPN-substance in the medium. With [15N2]-urea the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (E coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (Bifidobacterium sp.). With [15N]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (Proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (Bifidobacterium sp.). The findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.

AB  - Many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. In many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of Escherichia coli, and recently, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. Because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK-0787/MK-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. The distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. Its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. Results of our trials are summarized below: Of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the efficacy ratio of 89%. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - The efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  - A reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. Pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. A 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. The intestine was then divided at each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. The segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. This experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. Within three days 40% of the animals receiving pefloxacin died. Animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only 5% of these animals died. Thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  - The pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. Four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. Of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected. Quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. Pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. The results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.
TI  - Infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  - Parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. Infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. A variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. The exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. Susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may all play some role. Controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions, attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. In addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. Many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. Well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. After the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- SD) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. At 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the Escherichia coli (1:256) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). In urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- SD. Bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. A post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
TI  - [Cefminox concentration in tissues and clinical efficacy of cefminox in acute peritonitis].
AB  - Cefminox sodium (CMNX, MT-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii, CMNX has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. For therapeutic purpose, CMNX was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g X 1) to 2 g (1 X 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). The clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. No adverse effect was observed. There were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 Escherichia coli, some Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These isolated organisms were eradicated after CMNX treatment, except a strain of E. faecalis was decreased. In 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, CMNX was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body fluids samples were taken during the operation. CMNX concentration was determined to a bioassay with Escherichia coli NIHJ or Vibrio vercolans ATCC 8461 as the test organisms. CMNX concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). CMNX concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. In the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, CMNX levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. Therefore, CMNX sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.
TI  - Lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in B27-associated arthropathies.
AB  - Lymphocyte transformation tests to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease and controls. Ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/Reiter's to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to S. faecalis (p = 0.008). It appears, therefore, that within the B27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease.
TI  - Trends in bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Concern over the development of drug resistance by common pathogens has grown over recent years. In order to discover and describe possible trends at this institution, susceptibility data for 18 organisms and 21 antimicrobial agents for the years 1975 through 1982 at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Oklahoma City were reviewed. Summaries of susceptibility data for 64 major combinations of drugs and organisms are presented. Two gram-positive organisms (enterococcus group D and Staphylococcus aureus) as well as a gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) appear to be decreasing in susceptibility to several drugs. However, some gram-negative bacilli (Proteus, Serratia, and Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae) showed evidence of markedly increasing susceptibility to certain drugs.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  - [Comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1982). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - In vitro activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated  from patients with urinary tract infections were investigated by dilution method using MIC 2000 (Dynatec) during July to October in 1982. The summarized results are as follows: PMPC and CCL have showed potent activities against E coli among the oral antimicrobial agents. PMPC and CCL at 3.13 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of E. coli tested. CTM, CTX, CZX, CMX and LMOX at concentrations of 0.39 microgram/ml or less among the parenteral antimicrobial agents inhibited 90% of E. coli tested. The value of MIC90 (concentration at which 90% of isolates are inhibited) against K. pneumoniae results in the resistant range for ABPC, NA, CEX, CCL and ST. Among the parenteral cephems, CMX seemed most effective against K. pneumoniae tested. C. freundii seemed generally low susceptible to antimicrobial agents tested. Among the oral agents, PMPC, PPA and ST have showed moderate activity against C. freundii. Among the parenteral agents, CMX and LMOX also showed moderate activity against C. freundii, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested at 6.25 micrograms/ml. Among the oral agents, PMPC showed the most potent activity against E. cloacae. E. cloacae tested were highly resistant to the first and second generation cephems. Among the third generation, CMX seemed the most potent activity against E. cloacae isolated. However, CMX concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml was necessary to inhibit 50% of tested E. cloacae. P. mirabilis tested was resistant to all oral antimicrobial agents except CCL and ST. The value of MIC90 of the first and second generation cephems against P. mirabilis results in the moderately susceptible range (6.25-25 micrograms/ml). The third generation seemed most effective against P. mirabilis tested. PMPC, NA, PPA and ST concentrations of 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml were necessary to inhibit 50% of tested P. vulgaris. CEZ and CTM, seemed less potent activity than CFX and CMZ against P. vulgaris. CTX, CZX, CMX and LMOX except CPZ have showed potent activities against P. vulgaris, these at 0.1 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 50% of P. vulgaris tested. P. aeruginosa has been resistant to the third generation cephems except CPZ, but TOB, GM, AMK, CFS, PIPC and CPZ have showed high activities against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested at 0.39-6.25 micrograms/ml. The oral antimicrobial agents, and first and second generation cephems had not showed significant activity against S. marcescens. And strains of S. marcescens were relatively susceptible to the third generation cephems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - The bactericidal, fungicidal and sporicidal properties of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of aqueous solutions of peracetic acid and hydrogen  peroxide have been compared. Peracetic acid exhibited excellent antimicrobial properties, especially under acidic conditions. Reductions by a factor of 10(6) in the numbers of vegetative bacteria are obtained within 1 min at 25 degrees C using a solution containing 1.3 mmol/l of peracetic acid. Rapid activity against bacterial spores and yeasts also occurs. Hydrogen peroxide is more effective as a sporicide than as a bactericide, with sporicidal action being obtained using a solution containing 0.88 mol/l. Bactericidal action is poor but hydrogen peroxide was bacteriostatic at concentrations above 0.15 mmol/l.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was fundamentally and clinically studied. The following results were obtained. Serum and internal genital tissue levels of T-1982 were measured following intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion of 1 g. High serum levels of more than 10 micrograms/ml and tissue levels of more than 5 micrograms/g were maintained for 3 hours after intravenous administration. Favourable transfer of T-1982 into the pelvic dead space exudate was observed. The exudate level attained its peak at 2 hours and was 14.6 micrograms/ml on average even at 8 hours after intravenous infusion. With its MIC values, T-1982 was considered to be bactericidal against many Gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas sp. A total of 4 cases comprising 2 with pyometra, 1 with pelveoperitonitis and 1 with endometritis complicated with pelveoperitonitis was treated with T-1982 at a dose of 1-2 g twice daily by intravenous drip infusion. The clinical response was excellent in 1 case and good in 2 cases. A case with pyometra due to S. faecalis did not respond to the therapy. Side effects and abnormal laboratory findings due to the drug were not noted.

TI  - Ceftazidime in the treatment of urinary tract infection.
AB  - Twenty-nine patients with urinary tract infection were treated with ceftazidime intramuscularly, at a dosage of 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The patient series was predominantly geriatric, with a mean age of 70.9 years and including 17 patients over 75 years. Nine had an in-dwelling catheter and azotaemia was found in 14 cases. In this clinically difficult group, a positive bacteriological response to treatment was obtained in 72.9% and, if patients with in-dwelling catheters are excluded, 90% were cured. Ceftazidime-resistant Streptococcus faecalis was cultured before treatment in 6 of the 8 unsuccessful cases. In the remaining 2 treatment failures, Streptococcus faecalis was isolated immediately after treatment. In terms of clinical response to therapy all patients were cured or improved. Treatment with ceftazidime was well tolerated. No subjective side-effects occurred. One patient developed a distinct but transient elevation of liver enzymes, and in 2 cases a negative direct Coombs test was temporarily positive.
TI  - The screening of four aminoglycosides in the selective decontamination of the digestive tract in mice.
AB  - The suppressive effect of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin and paromomycin on the aerobic endogenous flora and on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract was tested by administering one of the antibiotics orally at five different dose levels. At a certain dose level, all antibiotics suppressed the endogenous Enterobacteriaceae species. Amikacin was particularly effective in this respect. Low doses of amikacin rapidly destroyed the colonization resistance. This resistance only remained unaffected in animals treated with tobramycin in doses that were still adequate to completely suppress the endogenous Enterobacteriaceae species. We concluded that of all the antibiotics tested in this study, only tobramycin may have a future in (clinical) application for the selective decontamination of the digestive tract. Selective decontamination can be considered an effective method for infection prevention in leukopenic patients.
TI  - [Inactivation of viruses and bacteria in sewage sludge by gamma radiation (author's transl)].
AB  - The kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. All these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. The reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. Considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. The radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.
TI  - The effect of prophylactic tinidazole on the anaerobic vaginal flora in patients  undergoing gynaecological surgery.
AB  - The effects of prophylactic tinidazole on the vaginal carrier state of anaerobic  bacteria and the development of postoperative infections were studied in 50 patients undergoing gynaecological surgery. The results are based on a double-blind trial, using tinidazole (Fasigyn; Pfizer) and placebo. Although no postoperative infections other than urinary tract infections were observed in our series, this study shows conclusively that the isolation of anerobic bacteria from the vagina decreased markedly in the tinidazole group compared with the placebo group.
TI  - [Examinations on the behaviour of grampositive and gramnegative bacteria on aluminium foil (author's transl)].
AB  - The survival times of Staph. aureus, Strept. faecalis, E. coli, Klebs. pneumoniae, Ser. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found out on aluminium foil. It was examined whether there exists a dependence on the initial colony count and in mixed cultures a mutual influence of the several species of bacteria. The longest survival times were found among the grampositive cocci. Ser. marcescens and Klebs. pneumoniae could no more be indicated after 19 days in case of initial colony count of log 7.0/cm2; E. coli could no more be shown after 14 days. P. aeruginosa had the shortest survival time. The dependence on the initial colony count was ascertained in 3 different concentrations of bacteria. The highest concentrations showed the smallest reduction of cocci and the longest survival times of Enterobacteriaceae respectively. The middle and lowest initial colony counts showed quicker reduction or shorter survival times. Ser. marcescens was more resistant to drying than Klebs. pneumoniae. The quickest dying rates showed P. aeruginosa without any dependence on initial colony count. In mixed cultures with Staph. aureus or Strept. faecalis survival times of Enterobacteriaceae were longer; the same result gave Klebs. pneumoniae in culture together with Ser. marcescens. The following explanation might be possible: because of the drying resistance of grampositive cocci the total bacteria number in these mixed cultures after several days is higher than in monocultures of E. coli, Klebs. pneumoniae or Ser. marcescens. This protects the Enterobacteriaceae against external influences for a longer time. Therefore it is understandable that the effect increases with the length of duration. The same interpretation could apply to the mixed cultures of Klebs. pneumoniae/Ser. marcescens.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Stomach as source of bacteria colonising respiratory tract during artificial ventilation.
AB  - 10 adults had intermittent positive-pressure ventilation for 3--34 days. All 10 had paralytic ileus. Microbial overgrowth in the stomach was found in 9 patients (bacterial in 7 and fungal in 2); gram-negative bacteria predominated. The trachea invariably became colonised by bacteria, mainly gram-negative organisms. In 3 instances the gram-negative bacteria were found in the stomach before they appeared in the tracheal aspirate, and in 1 case the pathogen originated in the faeces.
TI  - Susceptibility of the anaerobic bacteria, group D streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas to semisynthetic penicillins: carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - Sodium piperacillin T-1220, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was tested in vitro against 297 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and 669 aerobic bacteria by the conventional agar dilution method and compared with carbenicillin and ticarcillin. At a 100-mug/ml concentration the three drugs showed comparable effectiveness against the anaerobes tested. However, at 20 mug/ml, piperacillin was the most effective drug against Bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococci, and group D streptococci. At this drug concentration only 48% of the B. fragilis strains exhibited susceptibility to carbenicillin only, 64% exhibited susceptibility to ticarcillin but 90% exhibited susceptibility to piperacillin. Similar findings were observed with peptostreptococci and group D streptococci. On a weight basis piperacillin was statistically shown to be the most effective antibiotic of the three tested against these anaerobes. At 20 mug/ml, piperacillin exhibited a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) over carbenicillin and ticarcillin for Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas isolates, and Citrobacter diversus. At both 20- and 100-mug/ml concentrations, piperacillin appeared to be the most effective (calculated P < 0.01) upon Klebsiella species, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and C. freundii in activity over ticarcillin and carbenicillin.

TI  - [Development of a new testmethod for surface disinfection procedures. III. The impression method: influence of the test surface material and the types of microorganisms on the recovery rate (author's transl)].
AB  - The preceding test results appear to favour the impression method used for the testing of surface disinfection procedures. Further investigations were concerned with the selection of a suitable germ carrier. The high recovery rate of the bacteria and the invariably uniform quality of the germ carrier are the decisive criteria. Since a dependence on the type of germ was also to be expected, we checked Staph. aureus, Str. faecalis, E. coli, Kl. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa for their behaviour on PVC, varnished wooden surfaces, V 2A, rough and smooth glass, resopal, ceramic tiles with dull and glazing finish as well as on plywood. The germ carriers were contaminated quantitatively, dried, sprayed with distilled water to stimulate disinfection and examined after they were allowed to react for a period of 6 hours. A set of 10 germ carriers was examined simultaneously with 10 Rodac impressions. The data were checked by variance analytical methods and evaluated on the mean (or median) values. It was found that while the initial germ number was kept equal OP tiles and V 2A steel produced the highest germ yield. Plywood proved largely unsuitable. Among the test germs, E. coli and Kl. pneumoniae had the lowest adhesion; it was inferior to that of staphylococci and pseudomonads. However, for these 4 germ types 3 impressions per germ carrier suffice for a reliable assessment based on computations. The yield amounts to more than 90 per cent. 94 per cent of the Streptococci were also recovered with 3 impressions, but the absolute germ quantity was low. The use of this type of germ can be recommended only with reservation.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Products from furans. 1. Sunthesis and anticoccidial and antimicrobial activity of 5-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(4H)-ones and related compounds.
AB  - A Michael type addition of an amine to 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one (1) dissolved in ether, benzene, or THF gave 5-amino derivatives of 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(4H)-one (2). These by subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 were converted to 5-amino derivatives of 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ol (3). Both isomers A and B of 1 (in regard to the methoxy group at C6) were used for the synthesis of 2 and 3. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the amine adducts 2 was of the same order of magnitude as the starting material. Amine adducts in general, however, were by far more active as coccidiostats than the starting material and retained their activities when they were reduced. 5,6-Dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2H-pyran-3(4H) -one hydrochloride (A) and 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2H-pyran-3(4H) -one hydrochloride (B), prepared from isomer A and B of 1, respectively, were the most active as coccidiostats. These compounds when administered orally to chickens 1 day prior to infection at a concentration 0.05% in their diet gave them total protection against Eimeria tenella.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of penicillins and cephalosporines in urine  (author's transl)].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), cephalothin (CEF), cefazolin (CEZ), carbenicillin (CAR) and ticarcillin (TIC) were determined against Strep. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Prot. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa in Sensitivity Test Broth (STB) and human urine. Marked differences were seen in MIC between these two media, especially against P. mirabilis strains tested. Against E. coli the MIC of AMP, CEF and CEZ were similar or slightly lower in urine than in STB. MIC for CAR against E. coli were higher in urine. Against K. pneumoniae the MIC for CEF and CEZ were 2-4fold higher in urine than in STB. The activity of CAR and TIC against Ps. aeruginosa was lower in urine. Albeit high concentrations of antibiotics (up to 800fold) no inhibition was achieved in urine against P. mirabilis by AMP, CEF or CEZ. Only against Strep. faecalis all tested antibiotics had lower MIC in urine than in STB.
TI  - Chemistry and antibacterial activity of nitrobenzofurans.
AB  - Thirteen 2-methylbenzofurans were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was investigated. 2-Methyl-3-nitrobenzofuran and analogs containing 7-NO2, 5-NO2, 7-Br, 7-CONH2, and 7-CF3 substituents are bacteriostatic. The spectrum of activity of these compounds is similar to nitrofurazone; however, a strain of E. coli Br which has increased resistance to nitrofurazone did not show increased resistance to 3,7-dinitro-2-methylbenzofuran (1). The 3-nitro-2-methylbenzofurans are labile in solution (T1/2 0.8-3.5 hr at 37 degrees, pH 7.0). The solvolysis product of 1 was identified as alpha,6-dinitro-o-cresol (15). The 3-nitrobenzofurans are more potent in minimal media than in Penassay broth. This greater potency can be abolished by addition of casamino acids and tryptophan to the minimal media.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl analongs of some nitrofurans.
AB  - The sulfoxides 5-methylsulfinyl-2-furaldehyde semicarbazone (2) and 1-[(5-methylsulfinyl-2-fufurylidene)amino]hydantoin (3) as well as the sulfones 1-[(5-methylsulfonyl-2-furfurylidene)animo]hydantoin (1) and 1-(5-methylsulfonly-2-furyl)-2-(6-amino-3-p-ridazyl)ethylene hydrochloride (4) have been prepared and tested for antibacterial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The compounds are much less active than the corresponding 5-nitrofuran derivatives, possibly because their reduction potentials are too negative for them to interfere with reductive enzyme systems within the bacteria.
TI  - [Microbiological study of gentamiycin].
AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.
TI  - Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.

AB  - The synthesis, microbiological profile and in vivo effectiveness in laboratory animals of a series of cephalosporins having 7-acyl substituents derived from methylthioacetic acid are described. Structure-activity relationships examined include the effect of oxidation of the side-chain sulfur atom, replacement of the (side-chain) methyl hydrogens by fluorine and replacement of the 3-acetoxy substituent by thioheterocycles. One derivative, 7-trifluoromethylthioacetamido-3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 -carboxylic acid (SK&F 59962), was found to have outstanding antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Determination of site of infection in endocarditis.
AB  - Medical-surgical treatment of antibiotic refractory endocarditis requires determination of the site of infection, which is not always possible with conventional cardiac catheterization. The cases of two patients with right-sided endocarditis who survived after combined medical-surgical therapy are presented. One had persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia and three possible sites of infection. Multiple quantitative blood cultures proximal and distal to each suspected site indicated the pulmonary valve alone was infected. The second had sustained bacteremia with three enteric organisms and no apparent valvular abnormality. Quantitative cultures excluded the abdomen as the continuing source of bacteremia and suggested the tricuspid valve was infected. This was confirmed by a second catheterization using multiple cultures in conjuction with dye dilution studies, intracardiac phonocardiography, and angiography. These bacteriologic and cardiologic techniques may be especially useful in detecting right-sided endocarditis and may also be helpful in detecting concomitant infection of both sides of the heart.
TI  - Chemotherapeutic nitroheterocycles. 18. 2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and -acetophenones substituted by aminoalkoxy groups.
AB  - 2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and -acetophenones  substituted by aminoalkoxy groups and related compounds (41-69, table ii) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities were evaluated (table iii). Some of these compounds (e.g. 47, 52, and 59) suprisingly exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum including Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extraordinary antitrichomonal activities could also be observed in vitro (MIC of compound 59, 0.0004 pg/ml) and six of the title compounds (48, 49, 52, 58, 64, 66) displayed in vivo activity in mice against Trichomonas vaginalis comparable to that of metronidazole (70).
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in schoolchildren in Newcastle upon Tyne.
AB  - A screening survey for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in Newcastle upon Tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1.9%. In girls 4 to 6 years it was 1.4%, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2.5%, in girls aged 12 to 18 years it was 1.6%, a statistically significant rise and fall. Renal scarring was found in 39 (15%) of 254 girls with ASB. Neither the prevalence nor the severity of renal scarring increased with age. There was no association between ASB and social class. Of the 254 girls with ASB, 24% had no symptoms. Infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with Esch. coli. The prevalence of ASB in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18 was low, 0.2%. Ureteric reflux was present in 15% of girls without renal scarring and in 46% of those with renal scarring (P less than 0.001). Renal scarring also showed a significant association with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. The greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. This study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. It therefore does not support the recommendation for prescriptive screening of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of ASB.

AB  - A square grid pattern, printed in hydrophobic material on conventional membrane filters, subdivided the surface into a plurality of areas. This separated colonies from one another and prevented lateral growth, spreading, and confluence. Very high colony-packing densities were achieved (2,500/in(2); ca. 1.61 x 10(5)/cm(2)) reducing the need to dilute samples. Recovery of organisms was better than on conventional filters, particularly at high inoculum levels. At the same time, visibility of normally pale or diffuse colonies was improved, since colonies grew upwards instead of sideways, and counting was facilitated because colonies grew in orderly arrays.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  - The effect of oral administration of antibiotics on the intestinal flora of conventional mice and their resistance to colonization by orally introduced Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. Colonization resistance (CR) was expressed as the log of the oral bacterial dose followed by a persistent take in 50% of the contaminated animals. The intestinal flora was virtually eliminated by the antibiotics and this elimination was accompanied by a precipitous fall of CR. CR gradually returned to normal values during the period of repopulation of the intestinal tract by the organisms surviving the treatment. Antibiotic treatment resulted in the disappearance of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci and yeasts and, under appropriate housing conditions, the animals remained free of these organisms indefinitely. Germ-free mice contaminated with the intestinal flora of an antibiotic-treated animal and their offspring housed in a germ-free isolator showed high values of CR. Their intestinal flora consisted of anaerobic bacteria only. Apparently, these anaerobes are responsible for CR in these and in conventional mice.

TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  - Antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  - A series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. Although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In other comparative laboratory tests against P. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. An examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. The compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. Results of studies with a cell-free P. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for P. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. Some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
