an international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: zaaps program results for 2011.
through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and hong kong. linezolid mic90 values were 2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the mic90 value was 1 mug/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. all s. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml. three (0.3%) of 928 strains of cons had a linezolid mic of 4 mug/ml and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in l3. there were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (brazil [5], france [1], germany [2] greece [2], italy [2], ireland [1], and spain [1]) representing 5 species (e. faecium, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. lugdenensis). a mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid mic values; one was a s. haemolyticus isolate with a mic at 4 mug/ml. resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 zaaps program: cons, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among s aureus, s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. as the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
[post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae, was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.
[yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
[yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. posgar. portuguese study group of antimicrobial resistance.
during a 2-year period, 10 portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. of more than 12,000 staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 71% of s. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% s. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. most of the 5,000 enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 e. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. a high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both enterococcus species. this survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in e. faecium. the high prevalence of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and in the cns remains an issue of medical concern.
european glycopeptide susceptibility survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. european glycopeptide resistance survey study group.
in the european glycopeptide susceptibility survey 7078 gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of western europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. teicoplanin (mode mic 0.5 microgram/ml) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml) against staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (mic < or = 4 micrograms/ml) and all but four to teicoplanin (mic < or = 8 micrograms/ml); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml). with coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of mic of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/ml teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/ml (resistant). among isolates of s. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml) and 3.3% were resistant (mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) to teicoplanin. however, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. generally, teicoplanin (mode mic < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode mic < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. glycopeptide-susceptible enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode mic 0.25 microgram/ml) than to vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml). combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (vana phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of enterococcus faecium than in enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. four isolates of e. faecium and four of e. faecalis expressed the vanb-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. spain was the only country not to submit resistant e. faecium strains while resistant e. faecalis isolates came only from spain and italy.
antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
the activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, jm-1397 (oso2[xylyl]2) and jm-2469 (aucl[s2cpet3]). both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) of 1 microgram/ml for jm-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for jm-2469. similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus). jm-2469 inhibited group a, b, c, f, and g beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (mic90 4 micrograms/ml) but enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml. jm-1397 had mics for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides, and clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). mics of both compounds for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. these studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against gram-positive and anaerobic species.
in vitro activity of decaplanin (m86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
the in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly m86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). however, some rarely isolated and selected enterococcus sp. populations had a mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and s. haemolyticus strains had a mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. these in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some enterococcus species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (mics, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
