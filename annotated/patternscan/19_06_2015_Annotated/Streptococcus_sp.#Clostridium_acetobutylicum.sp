TI  == identifying gene clusters within localized regions in multiple genomes.
AB  == an important strategy to study genome evolution is to investigate the clustering  of orthologous genes among multiple genomes, in which the most popular approaches require that the distance between adjacent genes in a cluster be small. we investigate a different formulation based on constraining the overall size of a cluster and develop statistical significance estimates that allow direct comparison of clusters of different sizes. we first consider a restricted version which requires that orthologous genes are strictly ordered within each cluster and show that it can be solved in polynomial time. we then develop practical exact algorithms for the unrestricted problem that allows paralogous genes within a genome and clusters that may not appear in every genome while considering a general model in which a gene is allowed to appear in more than one orthologous group. we show that our algorithm can identify biologically relevant gene clusters on four bacterial genomes bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and clostridium acetobutylicum. we also show that our algorithm can identify significantly more functionally enriched gene clusters on  four yeast genomes saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces paradoxus, saccharomyces mikatae, and saccharomyces bayanus than previous algorithms. a software program (gcfinder) and a list of gene clusters found on the bacterial and the yeast genomes are available at http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/shsze/gcfinder .

TI  == novel substrate specificity of glutathione synthesis enzymes from streptococcus agalactiae and clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and glutathione synthetase (gs) in living organisms. recently, bifunctional fusion protein, termed gamma-gcs-gs catalyzing both gamma-gcs and gs reactions from gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae, has been reported. we revealed that in the gamma-gcs activity, s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs had different substrate specificities from those of escherichia coli gamma-gcs. furthermore, s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-glu-x(aa)-gly, from free three amino acids. in clostridium acetobutylicum,  the genes encoding gamma-gcs and putative gs were found to be immediately adjacent by blast search, and had amino acid sequence homology with s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs, respectively. we confirmed that the proteins expressed from each gene showed gamma-gcs and gs activity, respectively. c. acetobutylicum gs had broad substrate specificities and synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-glu-cys-x(aa). whereas the substrate specificities of gamma-gcs domain protein and gs domain protein of s. agalactiae  gamma-gcs-gs were the same as those of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequence of the dna gyrase (gyra) gene from mycoplasma hominis and characterization of quinolone-resistant mutants selected in vitro with trovafloxacin.
AB  == we report the cloning and characterization of the gyra gene of the mycoplasma hominis dna gyrase, which was previously shown to be associated with quinolone resistance in this organism. the 2,733-bp gyra gene encodes a protein of 911 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 102.5 kda. as expected, m. hominis gyra exhibits higher homology with the gyra subunits of the gram-positive bacteria clostridium acetobutylicum, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus than with its escherichia coli counterpart. knowing the entire sequence of the gyra gene of m. hominis could be very useful for confirming the role of the gyra subunit in fluoroquinolone resistance. twenty-nine mutants of m. hominis were selected stepwise for resistance to trovafloxacin, a new potent fluoroquinolone, and their gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare quinolone resistance-determining regions were characterized. three rounds of selection yielded 3 first-step, 12 second-step, and 14 third-step mutants. the first-step mutants harbored a single substitution, glu460-->lys (e. coli coordinates), in pare. gyra changes, ser83-->leu, glu87-->lys, and ala119-->glu or val, were found only in the second round of selection. at the third step, additional substitutions, at parc ser80, ser81, and glu84 and pare leu440, associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones, appeared. thus, high-level resistance to trovafloxacin required three steps and was associated with alterations in both fluoroquinolone targets. according to these genetic data, in m. hominis, as in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, topoisomerase iv seems to be the primary target of trovafloxacin.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == broad-host-range shuttle vectors for screening of regulated promoter activity in  viridans group streptococci: isolation of a ph-regulated promoter.
AB  == viridans group streptococci are major constituents of the normal human oral flora and are also identified as the predominant pathogenic bacteria in native valve infective endocarditis. little information is available regarding the regulation  of gene expression in viridans group streptococci, either in response to changes  in the oral environment or during development of endocarditis. we therefore constructed a set of broad-host-range vectors for the isolation of promoters from viridans group streptococci that are activated by specific environmental stimuli  in vitro or in vivo. a genomic library of streptococcus gordonii strain ch1 was constructed in one of the new vectors, and this library was introduced into a homologous bacterium by using an optimized electroporation protocol for viridans  group streptococci. because viridans group streptococci entering the bloodstream  from the oral cavity encounter an increase in ph, we selected promoters upregulated by this specific stimulus. one of the selected promoter sequences showed homology to the promoter region of the hyda gene from clostridium acetobutylicum, the expression of which is known to be regulated by the environmental ph. the isolation of this ph-regulated promoter shows that s. gordonii can sense an increase in the environmental ph, which serves as a signal  for bacterial gene activation. furthermore, this demonstrates the usefulness of these new selection vectors in research on adaptive gene expression of viridans group streptococci and possibly also of other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == the pneumococcal cell wall degrading enzymes: a modular design to create new lysins?
AB  == autolysins are enzymes that degrade different bonds in the peptidoglycan and, eventually, cause the lysis and death of the cell. streptococcus pneumoniae contains a powerful autolytic enzyme that has been characterized as an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. we have cloned the lyta gene coding for this  amidase and studied in depth the genetics and expression of this gene, which represented the first molecular analysis of a bacterial autolysin. two observations have been fundamental in revealing further knowledge on the lytic systems of pneumococcus: (a) the well-documented dependence of the pneumococcal autolysin on the presence of choline in the cell wall for activity, and (b) the early observation that most pneumococcal phages also required the presence of this amino-alcohol in the growth medium to achieve a successful liberation of the phage progeny. we concluded that choline would serve as an element of strong selective pressure to preserve certain structures of the host and phage lytic enzymes which should lead to sequence homologies. we constructed active chimeras  between the lytic enzymes of s. pneumoniae and its bacteriophages using genes that share sequence homology as well as genes that completely lack homologous regions. in this way, we demonstrated that the pneumococcal lytic enzymes are the result of the fusion of two independent functional modules where the carboxy-terminal domain might be responsible for the specific recognition of choline-containing cell walls whereas the active center of these enzymes should be localized in the n-terminal part of the protein. the modular design postulated for the pneumococcal lysins seems to be a widespread model for many types of microbial proteins and the construction of functional chimeric proteins between the lytic enzymes of pneumococcus and those of several gram-positive microorganisms, like clostridium acetobutylicum or lactococcus lactis, provided interesting clues on the modular evolution of proteins. the study of several genes coding for the lytic enzymes of temperate phages of pneumococcus also highlighted on some evolutionary relationships between microorganisms. we suggest that lysogenic relationships may represent a common mechanism by which pathogenic organisms like pneumococcus should undergo a rapid adaptation to an evolving environment.

TI  == tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052 cspa gene.
AB  == the major secreted protein of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052, a choline-containing strain, is cspa (clostridial secreted protein). it appears to  be a 115,000-m(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues  of the cell wall. polyclonal antibodies raised against cspa detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. the soluble cspa protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined n-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspa gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an m(r) of 63,740. according to the predicted amino acid sequence, cspa is synthesized with an n-terminal segment of  26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. expression of the cspa gene in escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-cspa-labeled  protein of 80,000 da which was purified by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. a comparison of cspa with other proteins in the embl database revealed that the c-terminal half of cspa is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (lyta amidase), the pneumococcal antigen pspa, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. this region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of clostridium difficile.

TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.

TI  == role of the c-terminal domain of the lysozyme of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  824 in a chimeric pneumococcal-clostridial cell wall lytic enzyme.
AB  == an active chimeric cell wall lytic enzyme has been constructed by domain substitution between the major autolysins of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824  and streptococcus pneumoniae. the chimeric enzyme, built up by the fusion of the  n-terminal domain of the pneumococcal lyta amidase and the c-terminal domain of the clostridial lyc lysozyme, exhibited an amidase activity capable of hydrolyzing choline-containing clostridial cell walls with an efficiency 250-times higher than when tested on pneumococcal cell walls. this experimental approach demonstrates the basic role of the c-terminal domain of the lyc lysozyme in substrate recognition and provides additional support to our hypothesis of modular evolution of these lytic enzymes. moreover, the construction described here confirmed the role of the c-terminal domains of the modular cell wall lytic  enzymes on the optimal ph for catalytic activity. to our knowledge, this is the first example of the construction of an active chimeric lytic enzyme by fusing genes that lack nucleotide homology and are derived from different bacterial genera.

TI  == interchange of functional domains switches enzyme specificity: construction of a  chimeric pneumococcal-clostridial cell wall lytic enzyme.
AB  == bacterial autolysins are endogenous enzymes that specifically cleave covalent bonds in the cell wall. these enzymes show both substrate and bond specificities. the former is related to their interaction with the insoluble substrate whereas the latter determine their site of action. the bond specificity allows their classification as muramidases (lysozymes), glucosaminidases, amidases, and endopeptidases. to demonstrate that the autolysin (lyc muramidase) of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824 presents a domainal organization, a chimeric gene (clc) containing the regions coding for the catalytic domain of the lyc muramidase and  the choline-binding domain of the pneumococcal phage cpl1 muramidase has been constructed by in vitro recombination of the corresponding gene fragments. this chimeric construction codes for a choline-binding protein (clc) that has been purified using affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. several biochemical tests demonstrate that this rearrangement of domains has generated an enzyme with a choline-dependent muramidase activity on pneumococcal cell walls. since the parental lyc muramidase was choline-independent and unable to degrade pneumococcal cell walls, the formation of this active chimeric enzyme by exchanging protein domains between two enzymes that specifically hydrolyse cell walls of bacteria belonging to different genera shows that a switch on substrate  specificity has been achieved. the chimeric clc muramidase behaved as an autolytic enzyme when it was adsorbed onto a live autolysin-defective mutant of streptococcus pneumoniae. the construction described here provides experimental support for the theory of modular evolution which assumes that novel proteins have evolved by the assembly of preexisting polypeptide units.

TI  == purification and characterization of the extracellular alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the extracellular alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-d-glucanglucanohydrolase; ec 3.2.1.1)  from maltose-grown streptococcus bovis jb1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography (mono q). the enzyme had an isoelectric point of 4.50 and an apparent molecular mass of 77,000 da, as estimated by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme was rich in acidic and hydrophobic amino acids. the 15-amino-acid nh2-terminal sequence was 40% homologous with the bacillus subtilis saccharifying alpha-amylase and 27% homologous with the clostridium acetobutylicum alpha-amylase. alpha-amylase activity on soluble starch was optimal at ph 5.0 to 6.0. the enzyme was relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 8.5 and at temperatures below 50 degrees c.  when soluble potato starch was used as the substrate, the enzyme had a km of 0.88 mg.ml-1 and a kcat of 2,510 mumol of reducing sugar.min-1.mg of protein-1. the enzyme exhibited neither pullulanase nor dextranase activity and was 40 to 70% as active on amylopectin as on amylose. the major end products of amylose hydrolysis were maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose.

TI  == a general method for cloning reca genes of gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == an internal fragment of the reca gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. the internal 348- or 360-bp reca dna segments from bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, leuconostoc mesanteroides, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the g + c contents of the dna from these species range from 28 to 52%. the sequences of the bacterial reca genes show strong relatedness. this method is particularly useful  for the recovery of the reca genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.

TI  == sequence of the lyc gene encoding the autolytic lysozyme of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824: comparison with other lytic enzymes.
AB  == the lyc gene, encoding an autolytic lysozyme from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824, has been cloned. the nucleotide sequence of the lyc gene has been determined and found to encode a protein of 324 amino acids (aa) with a deduced mr of 34,939. the lyc gene is preceded by two open reading frames with unknown functions, suggesting that this gene is part of an operon. comparison between the deduced aa sequence of the lyc gene and the directly determined n-terminal sequence of the extracellular clostridial lysozyme suggests that the enzyme is synthesized without a cleavable signal peptide. moreover, the comparative analyses between the clostridial lysozyme and other known cell-wall lytic enzymes revealed a significant similarity with the n-terminal portion of the lysozymes of streptomyces globisporus, the fungus chalaropsis, the lactobacillus bulgaricus bacteriophage mv1, and the streptococcus pneumoniae bacteriophages of the cp family (cpl lysozymes). in addition, the analyses showed that the c-terminal half of the clostridial lysozyme was homologous to the n-terminal domain of the muramoyl-pentapeptide-carboxypeptidase of streptomyces albus, suggesting a role in substrate binding. the existence of five putative repeated motifs in the c-terminal region of the autolytic lysozyme suggests that this region could play  a role in the recognition of the polymeric substrate.

TI  == natural transfer of conjugative transposon tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the conjugative streptococcal transposon tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for alcaligenes eutrophus, citrobacter freundii, and escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). no transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. mating of an e. coli strain carrying tn916 yielded transconjugants with bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. the results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially  contributing to bacterial evolution.

AB  == tn1545, a conjugative transposon originally discovered in streptococcus pneumoniae, has been transferred from enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis to clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. transfer between different strains of c. acetobutylicum has also been observed. insertion of tn1545 into the c. acetobutylicum chromosome occurred at multiple sites, as shown by southern hybridization. although ermam (erythromycin-resistance) was the most satisfactory marker for primary selection of transconjugants, all three tn1545-encoded antibiotic resistance genes (apha-3, ermam, and tetm) were apparently expressed in c. acetobutylicum. our results indicate that tn1545 is potentially useful for  undertaking mutagenesis and mutational cloning in this industrially important organism. transfer of another conjugative transposon, tn916, from e. faecalis to  c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 was also apparently detected. circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a hot spot for tn916 insertion in the c. acetobutylicum ncib 8052 chromosome.

TI  == light-driven amino acid uptake in streptococcus cremoris or clostridium acetobutylicum membrane vesicles fused with liposomes containing bacterial reaction centers.
AB  == reaction centers of the phototrophic bacterium rhodopseudomonas palustris were introduced as proton motive force-generating systems in membrane vesicles of two  anaerobic bacteria. liposomes containing reaction center-light-harvesting complex i pigment protein complexes were fused with membrane vesicles of streptococcus cremoris or clostridium acetobutylicum by freeze-thawing and sonication. illumination of these fused membranes resulted in the generation of a proton motive force of approximately -110 mv. the magnitude of the proton motive force in these membranes could be varied by changing the light intensity. as a result of this proton motive force, amino acid transport into the fused membranes could  be observed. the initial rate of leucine transport by membrane vesicles of s. cremoris increased exponentially with the proton motive force. an h+/leucine stoichiometry of 0.8 was determined from the steady-state level of leucine accumulation and the proton motive force, and this stoichiometry was found to be  independent of the magnitude of the proton motive force. these results indicate that the introduction of bacterial reaction centers in membrane vesicles by the fusion procedure yields very attractive model systems for the study of proton motive force-consuming processes in membrane vesicles of (strict) anaerobic bacteria.
