TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

TI  == effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  == licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional chimese medicines. however, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate  to exert physiological effects. therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, six strains, comprising bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, bacillus sp. 46 and clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. a total  of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. the results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin.  on the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an emax precision microplate reader. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and  bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium was less severely affected.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.

TI  == description of anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic bacterium from clostridium rrna cluster iii isolated from soil of a japanese rice field, and reclassification of bacteroides cellulosolvens murray et al. 1984 as pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == an obligately anaerobic bacterial strain designated t-1-35(t) was isolated as a dominant cultivable cellulose-degrading bacterium from soil of a japanese rice field as an anaerobic filter-paper degrader. cells of strain t-1-35(t) stained gram-positive and were non-spore-forming rods with rounded ends, 0.8-1.0x3.5-15.0 microm, and motile by means of two to four polar flagella. cells of strain t-1-35(t) exhibited pleomorphism: in aged cultures (over 90 days of incubation),  almost all cells were irregularly shaped. although no spore formation was observed, cells tolerated high temperatures, up to 90 degrees c for 10 min. the temperature range for growth was 15-40 degrees c, with an optimum at 35 degrees c. the ph range for growth was 5.5-9.0, with an optimum at ph 8.0-8.5 (slightly alkaliphilic). strain t-1-35(t) fermented some carbohydrates to produce ethanol and lactate as the major products. major cellular fatty acids were iso-c16 : 0 and iso-c13 : 0 3-oh. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed that strain t-1-35(t) belonged to clostridium rrna cluster iii. the closest relative of strain t-1-35(t) was bacteroides cellulosolvens wm2(t), with  16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 93.4 %. phenotypic, physiological and molecular genetic methods demonstrated that strain t-1-35(t) was distinct from its phylogenetic relatives (members of clostridium rrna cluster iii) because it predominantly produced ethanol, iso-c13 : 0 3-oh was a major cellular fatty acid  and it always exhibited pleomorphism. on the basis of the results of a polyphasic taxonomic study, strain t-1-35(t) is considered to represent a novel genus and species, anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of anaerobacterium chartisolvens is t-1-35(t) ( = dsm 27016(t) = nbrc 109520(t)). in addition, from the results of our phylogenetic analysis and its phenotypic features, the species bacteroides cellulosolvens murray et al. 1984 is proposed to be reclassified in the new genus pseudobacteroides as pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov., with the type strain wm2(t) ( = atcc 35603(t) = dsm 2933(t) = nrcc 2944(t)).

TI  == time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. we investigated bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp.,  clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time  using quantitative real-time pcr. bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change  significantly up to 5 days post mortem. in cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). our results showed that ratios of bacteroides  sp., bifidobacterium sp., clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.

TI  == oral administration of heparin or heparosan increases the lactobacillus population in gut microbiota of rats.
AB  == heparin and heparosan have been confirmed to be effective blockers in inhibiting  adhesion of pathogens in vitro. however, their effects on gut microbiota in vivo  remain unknown. here we have studied the effects of oral administration of heparin or heparosan on gut microbiota in rats by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). results showed that  the predominant bacterial communities in the feces of heparin- or heparosan-treated animals were different from those of the saline-treated animals, with increased lactobacillus spp. and decreased enterococcus sp. different dgge banding patterns were also observed for the subpopulations of lactobacillus and bacteroides groups. in conclusion, heparin or heparosan may be  used as an effective gut microbiota modulator by increasing the subpopulation of  lactobacillus.

TI  == characterization of microbial community in the leachate associated with the decomposition of entombed pigs.
AB  == foot and mouth disease (fmd) is one of the acute infectious diseases in hoofed and even-toed mammals, including pigs, and it occurs via acute infection by aphthovirus. when fmd is suspected, animals around the location of origin are typically slaughtered and buried. other methods such as rendering, composting, and incineration have not been verified in practice in korea. after the fmd incident, the regular monitoring of the microbial community is required, as microorganisms greatly modify the characteristics of the ecosystem in which they  live. this is the result of their metabolic activities causing chemical changes to take place in the surrounding environment. in this study, we investigated changes in the microbial community during a 24 week period with dna extracts from leachate, formed by the decomposition of buried pigs at a laboratory test site, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with a genomic dna. our results revealed that bacteroides coprosuis, which is common in pig excreta, and  sporanaerobacter acetigenes, which is a sulfur-reduced microbe, were continuously observed. during the early stages (0~2 weeks) of tissue decomposition, clostridium cochlearium, fusobacterium ulcerans, and fusobacterium sp., which are involved in skin decomposition, were also observed. in addition, various microbes such as turicibacter sanguinis, clostridium haemolyticum, bacteroides propionicifaciens, and comamonas sp. were seen during the later stages (16~24 weeks). in particular, the number of existing microbial species gradually increased during the early stages, including the exponential phase, decreased during the middle stages, and then increased again during the later stages. therefore, these results indicate that the decomposition of pigs continues for a  long period of time and leachate is created continuously during this process. it  is known that leachate can easily flow into the neighboring environment, so a long-term management plan is needed in burial locations for fmd-infected animals.

TI  == green-lipped mussel extract (perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  == objective: to investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (git) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (oa) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent  and contentious findings from oa clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (glm)  and glucosamine. methods: a non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee oa. each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole glm extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (gs), p.o.  for 12 weeks. faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools  at t (0) and t (12) weeks. additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from  changes in arthritic scores in the western ontario mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) and the lequesne algofunctional indices and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs). an intention-to-treat analysis was  employed and participant data collected at t (0), t (6) and t (12) weeks. results: there were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the wilcoxon test. in both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in clostridium and staphylococcus species and increase in lactobacillus, streptococcus and eubacterium species. in the glm group bifidobacterium tended to increase and enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. the gs-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and coliforms species, most notably escherichia coli. we further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all oa outcome measures from t (0) to t (12) weeks for both the glm and gs groups. the gsrs scores indicated that git function significantly improved over the 12 weeks  duration with glm and gs supplementation. conclusion: both glm and gs reduced oa  symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline.  changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the clostridia sp. this study suggests that nutritional supplements such as glm and gs may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the git microbiota. the decrease in clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic th17 and cd4+ regulatory t cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved gsrs scores and oa symptoms for these oa participants. the git microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.

TI  == electricity generation from cattle dung using microbial fuel cell technology during anaerobic acidogenesis and the development of microbial populations.
AB  == a microbial fuel cell (mfc) was constructed to investigate the possible generation of electricity using cattle dung as a substrate. after 30 days of operation, stable electricity was generated, and the maximum volumetric power density was 0.220 w/m(3). the total chemical oxygen demand (tcod) removal and coulombic efficiency (ce) of the mfc reached 73.9+/-1.8% and 2.79+/-0.6%, respectively, after 120 days of operation. acetate was the main metabolite in the anolyte, and other volatile fatty acids (vfas) (propionate and butyrate) were present in minor amounts. the pcr-dgge analysis indicated that the following five groups of microbes were present: proteobacteria, bacteroides, chloroflexi, actinobacteria and firmicutes. proteobacteria and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the sample; specifically, 36.3% and 24.2% of the sequences obtained were proteobacteria and firmicutes, respectively. clostridium sp., pseudomonas luteola and ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were the most dominant groups during the electricity generation process. the diversity of archaea dramatically decreased after 20 days of operation. the detected archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and the methanobacterium genus disappeared during the periods of stable electricity generation via acidogenesis.

TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and  perinatal determinants influencing colonization.
AB  == background: although premature neonates (pn) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in pn are scarce. few studies have reported clostridia colonization in pn whereas bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be  a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. besides, pn are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics  can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. the aim of this study was to report the distribution of clostridium species isolated in feces from pn and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. results: of the 76 pn followed until hospital discharge in three french neonatal intensive care units (nicus), 79% were colonized by clostridia. clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except c. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. however, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10  days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the nicu (p = 0.048). conclusion: this study shows that clostridia are part of the pn gut microbiota. it provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in pn showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in nicus. the  main perinatal determinant influencing pn clostridia colonization appears to be the nicu environment.

TI  == changes in gut microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis administered the bacteria lactobacillus casei dn--114001.
AB  == gut microbiota was analyzed in children, aged 6-18 months and suffering from atopic dermatitis before and after 3 month supplementation of their diet with lactobacillus casei dn--114001 in a dose of 109 cells daily. on completion of this period the total number of fecal lactobacillus sp. cells decreased from 7.86 log10 cfu/g to 6.40 log10 cfu/g. after the next 5 months (without dietary supplementation with the probiotic bacteria) the level of lactobacillus sp. cells was maintained at the latter value. during the dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain, the level of bifidobacterium cells was maintained at 6.15-6.89  log10 cfu/g while after 5 months it decreased to 5.57 log10 cfu/g. the population of clostridium sp. was reduced after 3 months of dietary supplementation from 6.49 to 5.83 log10 cfu/g and was maintained at the latter level during the next 5 months. the dietary supplementation had no effect on populations of bacteroides sp., enterococcus sp. and enterobacteriaceae. supplementation of children who developed atopic dermatitis with the preparation of lactobacillus casei dn - 114001 positively affected their gut microbiota in terms of bifidobacteria and clostridia populations.

TI  == effect of beta -glucanase and xylanase supplementation of barley- and rye-based diets on caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == 1. the aim was to investigate the effect of grain type (barley or rye) and exogenous enzymes (beta-glucanase or xylanase) on the composition of chicken caecal microbiota as examined by classical culturing and molecular techniques (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (fish) and terminal-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (t-rflp)). 2. plate counting revealed higher total numbers of anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in caecal contents of birds fed with rye-based diets than in birds fed with barley-based diets. 3. as assessed by fish analysis, the most abundant bacterial groups in the broiler caeca were clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale followed by bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp., bifidobacterium sp. and enterobacteriaceae. for both cereal types, the enzyme supplementation significantly decreased the relative amount of enterobacteriaceae. 4. the t-rflp profiles indicated that the  caecal microbiota of birds receiving rye-based diets was more diverse than that of birds fed on barley-based diets. 5. irrespective of the method applied, the results indicate that the cereal type as well as the exogenous enzyme supplementation influence the microbiota in broiler chicken caeca, and may have the effect of reducing potentially pathogenic enterobacteriaceae populations.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
AB  == clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the uk each year. in this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a c. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to  control the pathogen. it is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of c. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins a and b. the remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable c. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. the numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp., lactobacillus  sp., total clostridium sp., and enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed  with metronidazole treatment. our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of c. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.

AB  == caecal samples from wild-type and tnf(deltaare) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (blautia spp., clostridium innocuum, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus murinus, parabacteroides goldsteinii and shigella dysenteriae). one additional isolate, strain a-c2-0, was a new bacterium. the closest relatives were bacteroides massiliensis, bacteroides dorei and bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). strain a-c2-0 is a gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 41.5%. its major cellular fatty acid is c(15:0 anteiso), and its major respiratory quinone is mk-9. cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. they are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. when compared with related bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not  metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. strain a-c2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides sartorii is proposed. the type  strain is a-c2-0(t) (= dsm 21941(t) = ccug 57211(t)).

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == characterization of bacteria, clostridia and bacteroides in faeces of vegetarians using qpcr and pcr-dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes of bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacterium and clostridium cluster iv in faecal microbiota associated with a vegetarian diet. methods: bacterial abundances were measured in faecal samples of 15 vegetarians and 14 omnivores using quantitative pcr. diversity was assessed with pcr-dgge fingerprinting, principal component analysis (pca) and shannon diversity index. results: vegetarians had a 12% higher abundance of bacterial dna than omnivores, a tendency for less clostridium cluster iv (31.86 +/- 17.00%; 36.64 +/- 14.22%) and higher abundance of bacteroides (23.93 +/- 10.35%; 21.26 +/- 8.05%), which were not significant due to high interindividual variations. pca suggested a grouping  of bacteria and members of clostridium cluster iv. two bands appeared significantly more frequently in omnivores than in vegetarians (p < 0.005 and p < 0.022). one was identified as faecalibacterium sp. and the other was 97.9% similar to the uncultured gut bacteriumdq793301. conclusions: a vegetarian diet affects the intestinal microbiota, especially by decreasing the amount and changing the diversity of clostridium cluster iv. it remains to be determined how these shifts might affect the host metabolism and disease risks.

TI  == [microbial diversity analysis in rotating drum biofilter for nitric oxide denitrifying removal].
AB  == pcr-dgge was applied to analyze the microbial communities in rotating drum biofilter (rdb) for nitric oxide denitrifying removal under anaerobic conditions. the 16s rrna genes (v3 region) were amplified with two universal primers (338f-gc and 518r). these amplified dna fragments were separated by parallel dgge. the dgge profiles of biofilm samples from different sections of rdb are similar and about sixteen types of microorganisms are identified in the biofilm samples. these results show that microbial diversity of rdb firstly increases but then decreases with the addition of cu ii (edta) and the increase of no removal efficiency. however, the change of microbial community is not significant during  the process. eight major bands of 16s rrna genes fragments from dgge profiles of  biofilm samples were further eluted from gel, re-amplified, cloned and sequenced. the sequences of these fragments were compared with the database in genebank (ncbi). the gene analysis of 16s rrna showed that the major populations are cytopahga-flexibacteria-bacteroides (cfb) group bacteroides, beta -proteobacterium, gamma-proteobacterium and clostridium sp.. in addition, denitrification is related with band g-5, g-6 and g-8. g-5 is affiliated with gamma-proteobacterium. both g-6 and g-8 are affiliated with beta-proteobacterium.

TI  == prognostic factors and impact of antibiotherapy in 117 cases of anaerobic bacteraemia.
AB  == bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria occurs infrequently, making the systematic  use of an anaerobic blood sample bottle in patients with sepsis controversial. we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and microbiological data from all cases of  anaerobic bacteraemia in a teaching hospital over 2 years and determined the prognostic factors and antibiotic management. with the goal of evaluating the morbidity and mortality of bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria, a case-control  study was also performed. one hundred eighty-four blood cultures from 125 patients grew at least one anaerobic bacterium, representing 0.5% of all and 7.0% of the positive blood cultures. one hundred seventeen patients were studied. in 24 cases, anaerobic blood cultures were associated with concomitant aerobic bacteria isolation. the most frequently isolated anaerobic species were bacteroides sp. (n = 62), clostridium sp. (n = 25), and fusobacterium sp. (n = 12). the most frequent site of origin was the digestive tract (n = 61). in 51 cases, patients did not receive adequate empirical antianaerobic therapy. the mortality rate was 27%. age [odds ratio (or) 1.059; 95% confidence interval (ci)  1.021-1.100], cancer history (or 3.21, 95% ci 1.126-9.156), and ineffective definitive antibiotherapy (or 19.292, 95% ci 5.330-69.832) were independently associated with increased hospital mortality. the 72 patients that could be matched with patients without anaerobic bacteria according to their primary diagnosis had a longer hospitalisation and a trend toward increased mortality (p  = 0.08). anaerobic bacteraemia contributed significantly to the morbidity of the  patients, and adequate empirical antibiotherapy may play an important role in the clinical outcomes.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == characterization of an antibiotic resistant clostridium hathewayi strain from a continuous-flow exclusion chemostat culture derived from the cecal contents of a  feral pig.
AB  == the chemostat model has been an important tool in studying intestinal microflora. to date, several competitive exclusion products have been developed from such studies as prophylactic treatment against pathogenic bacteria. a continuous-flow  chemostat model of a feral pig was developed using inocula from the cecal contents of a wild boar caught in east texas. several strains of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria were isolated including bacteroides, lactobacillus, enterococcus and clostridium sp. this study reports on the characterization of a  multidrug-resistant clostridium hathewayi strain that was isolated from this feral pig's cecal contents maintained in a continuous-flow chemostat system showing high resistance to carbapenems and macrolides (including the growth promoter tylosin). clostridium hathewayi has been documented to be pathogenic to  both humans and animals. feral pigs may be an important source of pathogenic and  antibiotic resistant bacteria and may pose potential risk to domestic species. further work is needed to elucidate the prevalence of these reservoirs and assess the contribution these may play in the spread of disease and resistance.

TI  == digestive tract microbiota in healthy volunteers.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to standardize the methods of sample collection of mucus from the digestive tract and to determine the microbiota in healthy volunteers from brazil, collecting samples from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. methods: microbiota of selected healthy volunteers from the oral cavity (n=10), the esophagus (n=10), the upper digestive tract (n=20), and the lower digestive tract (n=24) were evaluated through distinct collection methods. collection methods took into account the different sites, using basic scraping and swabbing techniques, stimulated saliva from the oral cavity, irrigation-aspiration with sterile catheters especially designed for the esophagus, a probe especially designed for  upper digestive tract, and a special catheter for the lower digestive tract. results: (i) mixed microbiota were identified in the oral cavity, predominantly gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci; (ii) transitional flora mainly in the  esophagus; (iii) veillonella sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp in the stomach and duodenum; (iv) in the jejunum and upper ileum, we observed bacteroides sp, proteus sp, and staphylococcus sp, in addition to veillonella sp; (v) in the colon, the presence of "nonpathogenic" anaerobic bacteria veillonella  sp (average 10(5) ufc) indicates the existence of a low oxidation-reduction potential environment, which suggests the possibility of adoption of these bacteria as biological markers of total digestive tract health. conclusions: the  collection methods were efficient in obtaining adequate samples from each segment of the total digestive tract to reveal the normal microbiota. these procedures are safe and easily reproducible for microbiological studies.

TI  == effect of chitosan on the growth of human colonic bacteria.
AB  == growth of 6 bacterial strains representing dominant members of the human colonic  microflora was measured in the presence of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.5 % chitosan (from shrimp shells, with a 97 % final degree of deacetylation). the effect of chitosan was variable and dependent on bacterial species. the most susceptible to chitosan were bacteria belonging to genera bacteroides and clostridium (91-97% growth inhibition). on the other hand, roseburia sp., eubacterium sp. and faecalibacterium sp. were more resistant (63-83 % inhibition of growth). chitosan can thus be considered as one of the means for influencing the bacterial population in the human colon.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == assessing optimal fermentation type for bio-hydrogen production in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors.
AB  == in this study, the optimal fermentation type and the operating conditions of anaerobic process in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors was investigated for the maximization of bio-hydrogen production using mixed cultures. butyric acid type fermentation occurred at ph>6, propionic acid type fermentation occurred at ph about 5.5 with e(h) (redox potential) >-278mv, and ethanol-type fermentation occurred at ph<4.5. the representative strains of these fermentations were clostridium sp., propionibacterium sp. and bacteriodes sp., respectively. ethanol fermentation was optimal type by comparing the operating stabilities and hydrogen production capacities between the fermentation types, which remained stable when  the organic loading rate (olr) reached the highest olr at 86.1kgcod/m(3)d. the maximum hydrogen production reached up to 14.99l/d.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of tce-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  == two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment  studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate tce to ethene. each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate tce to ethene through several serial transfers. microbial community analyses based upon 16s rdna, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination.  results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including dehalococcoides sp., low g+c gram-positives (mostly clostridium and eubacterium sp.), bacteroides sp., citrobacter sp., and delta proteobacteria (mostly desulfovibrio sp.). phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium.  inconsistent detection of dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and t-rflp of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (q-pcr). q-pcr with primers specific to dehalococcoides 16s rdna resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. our results suggest that tce-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of dehalococcoides cells detected with dehalococcoides specific 16s rdna primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.

AB  == c-glucosides, in which sugars are attached to the aglycone by carbon-carbon bonds, are generally resistant to acid and enzyme hydrolysis. the c-glucosyl bond of mangiferin, a xanthone c-glucoside, was cleaved by anaerobic incubation with a human intestinal bacterium, bacteroides sp. mang, to give norathyriol. a cell-free extract obtained by sonication of b. sp. mang demonstrated cleaving activity for mangiferin to norathyriol by adding nadh, diaphorase, and dithiothreitol. both high molecular weight (>10 k) and low molecular weight (<10  k) fractions obtained from the cell-free extract were required for the activity.  mncl2 was necessary for the activity, but other metal ions were not. by purification of the high molecular weight fraction using deae-cellulose and phenyl sepharose column chromatography, two fractions, designated as proteins a and b, were separated and required for the activity. neither protein a nor protein b alone showed any activity. this is the first report describing a c-glucosyl-cleaving enzyme from human intestinal bacterium that seems to involve  a novel enzyme mechanism.

TI  == monitoring of microbial community structure and succession in the biohydrogen production reactor by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge).
AB  == to study the structure of microbial communities in the biological hydrogen production reactor and determine the ecological function of hydrogen producing bacteria, anaerobic sludge was obtained from the continuous stirred tank reactor  (cstr) in different periods of time, and the diversity and dynamics of microbial  communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge).  the results of dgge demonstrated that an obvious shift of microbial population happened from the beginning of star-up to the 28th day, and the ethanol type fermentation was established. after 28 days the structure of microbial community  became stable, and the climax community was formed. comparative analysis of 16s rdna sequences from reamplifying and sequencing the prominent bands indicated that the dominant population belonged to low g+c gram-positive bacteria (clostridium sp. and ethanologenbacterium sp.), beta-proteobacteria (acidovorax sp.), gamma-proteobacteria (kluyvera sp.), bacteroides (uncultured bacterium sja-168), and spirochaetes (uncultured eubacterium e1-k13), respectively. the hydrogen production rate increased obviously with the increase of ethanologenbacterium sp., clostridium sp. and uncultured spirochaetes after 21 days, meanwhile the succession of ethanol type fermentation was formed. throughout the succession the microbial diversity increased however it decreased  after 21 days. some types of clostridium sp. acidovorax sp., kluyvera sp., and bacteroides were dominant populations during all periods of time. these special populations were essential for the construction of climax community. hydrogen production efficiency was dependent on both hydrogen producing bacteria and other populations. it implied that the co-metabolism of microbial community played a great role of biohydrogen production in the reactors.

AB  == aim: to test combined polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s rrna gene sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr/dgge) as an analytical method to investigate the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice during the development of colitis. methods and results: the colonic microbiota of formerly germfree interleukin 10 (il-10)-deficient mice that had been exposed to  the faecal microbiota of specific pathogen-free animals was screened using pcr/dgge. the composition of the large bowel microbiota of il-10-deficient mice changed as colitis progressed. dna fragments originating from four bacterial populations ('bacteroides sp.', bifidobacterium animalis, clostridium cocleatum,  enterococci) were more apparent in pcr/dgge profiles of colitic mice relative to  non-colitic animals, whereas two populations were less apparent (eubacterium ventriosum, acidophilus group lactobacilli). specific dna:rna dot blot analysis showed that bifidobacterial ribosomal rna (rrna) abundance increased as colitis developed. conclusions: pcr/dgge was shown to be an effective method to demonstrate changes in the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice in relation to progression of inflammatory disease. the intensity of staining of dna fragments in dgge profiles reflected increased abundance of bifidobacterial rrna  in the microbiota of colitic animals. as bifidobacterial fragments in pcr/dgge profiles generated from microbiota dna showed increased intensity of fragment staining, an increase in bifidobacterial numbers in colitic mice was indicated. significance and impact of the study: pcr/dgge analysis demonstrated an altered composition of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice. this work will allow specific groups of bacteria to be targeted in future research concerning the pathogenesis of colitis.

TI  == spatial distribution and stability of the eight microbial species of the altered  schaedler flora in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == the overall complexity of the microbial communities in the gastrointestinal (gi)  tracts of mammals has hindered observations of dynamics and interactions of individual bacterial populations. however, such information is crucial for understanding the diverse disease-causing and protective roles that gut microbiota play in their hosts. here, we determine the spatial distribution, interanimal variation, and persistence of bacteria in the most complex defined-flora (gnotobiotic) model system to date, viz., mice colonized with the eight strains of the altered schaedler flora (asf). quantitative pcr protocols based on the 16s rrna sequence of each asf strain were developed and optimized to specifically detect as few as 10 copies of each target. total numbers of the asf  strains were determined in the different regions of the gi tracts of three c.b-17 scid mice. individual strain abundance was dependent on oxygen sensitivity, with  microaerotolerant lactobacillus murinus asf361 present at 10(5) to 10(7) cells/g  of tissue in the upper gi tract and obligate anaerobic asf strains being predominant in the cecal and colonic flora at 10(8) to 10(10) cells/g of tissue.  the variation between the three mice was small for most asf strains, except for clostridium sp. strain asf502 and bacteroides sp. strain asf519 in the cecum. a comparison of the relative distribution of the asf strains in feces and the colon indicated large differences, suggesting that fecal bacterial levels may provide a poor approximation of colonic bacterial levels. all asf strains were detected by  pcr in the feces of c57bl/6 restricted flora mice, which had been maintained in an isolator without sterile food, water, or bedding for several generations, providing evidence for the stability of these strains in the face of potential competition by bacteria introduced into the gut.

AB  == an anaerobic landfill leachate bioreactor was operated with crystalline cellulose and sterile landfill leachate until a steady state was reached. cellulose hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis were measured. microorganisms attached to the cellulose surfaces were hypothesized to be the cellulose hydrolyzers. 16s rrna gene clone libraries were prepared from this attached fraction and also from the mixed fraction (biomass associated with cellulose particles and in the planktonic phase). both clone libraries were dominated by firmicutes phylum sequences (100% of the attached library and 90% of the mixed library), and the majority fell into one of five lineages of the clostridia. clone group 1 (most closely related to clostridium stercorarium), clone group 2 (most closely related to clostridium thermocellum), and clone group 5 (most closely related to bacteroides cellulosolvens) comprised sequences in clostridium group iii. clone group 3 sequences were in clostridium group xiva (most closely related to clostridium sp. strain xb90). clone group 4 sequences were affiliated  with a deeply branching clostridial lineage peripherally associated with clostridium group vi. this monophyletic group comprises a new clostridium cluster, designated cluster via. specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the five groups were designed and synthesized, and it was demonstrated in fish experiments that bacteria targeted by the probes for clone groups 1, 2, 4, and 5 were very abundant on the surfaces of the cellulose particles and likely the key cellulolytic microorganisms in the landfill bioreactor. the fish probe for clone group 3 targeted cells in the planktonic phase, and these organisms were hypothesized to be glucose fermenters.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. the strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. when anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a  beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. the early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.

TI  == sulfate-reducing bacteria colonize pouches formed for ulcerative colitis but not  for familial adenomatous polyposis.
AB  == purpose: ileal pouch-anal anastomosis remains the "gold standard" in surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. pouchitis occurs mainly in patients with a background of ulcerative colitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. the aim of this study was to characterize differences in pouch bacterial populations between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous pouches. methods: after ethical approval was obtained, fresh stool samples were collected from patients with ulcerative colitis pouches (n = 10), familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 7) pouches, and ulcerative colitis ileostomies (n = 8). quantitative measurements of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  were performed. results: sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from 80 percent  (n = 8) of ulcerative colitis pouches. sulfate-reducing bacteria were absent from familial adenomatous polyposis pouches and also from ulcerative colitis ileostomy effluent. pouch lactobacilli, bifidobacterium, bacteroides sp, and clostridium perfringens counts were increased relative to ileostomy counts in patients with ulcerative colitis. total pouch enterococci and coliform counts were also increased relative to ileostomy levels. there were no significant quantitative or qualitative differences between pouch types when these bacteria were evaluated. conclusions: sulfate-reducing bacteria are exclusive to patients with a background of ulcerative colitis. not all ulcerative colitis pouches harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria because two ulcerative colitis pouches in this study were free of the latter. they are not present in familial adenomatous polyposis pouches or in ileostomy effluent collected from patients with ulcerative colitis. total bacterial counts increase in ulcerative colitis pouches after stoma closure. levels of lactobacilli, bifidobacterium, bacteroides sp, clostridium perfringens, enterococci, and coliforms were similar in both pouch groups. because sulfate-reducing bacteria are specific to ulcerative colitis pouches, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria and intrahepatic stones: detections of clostridium sp. and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == objective: to detect anaerobic bacteria clostridium sp. and bacteroides fragilis  in intrahepatic stones by molecular genetic method. methods: dna was extracted from 59 stone samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification targeting the 16s rrna gene of clostridium sp. and the glutamine synthetase gene of bacteroides fragilis. single-strand conformational polymorphism (sscp) analysis was performed to identify the clostridium sp. results: 16s rrna gene sequences for clostridium sp. were identified in 49 stones (83%, 49/59). the two most common groups were detected in 19 (41%) and 17 (37%) of the 46 samples using sspc analysis, and 25/59 (42%) stones were tested positive for bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: anaerobes such as clostridium sp. and bacteroides fragilis present in intrahepatic stones and may play a role in stone formation. pcr is a useful technique to detect fastidious pathogens, which  are difficult to culture. sscp of pcr products is a rapid method in differentiating bacterial species.

TI  == 16s rrna-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. therefore, a survey of cecal  bacteria was done by retrieval of 16s rrna gene sequences from dna isolated from  the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. the ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature  gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). partial 16s rrna gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in ttge gels. a total of 1,656 partial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in  the genbank. the comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (clostridium leptum, sporomusa sp., clostridium coccoides, and enterics). sequences of members of the bacteroides group, the bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. sequences related to those from the escherichia sp. subgroup and from lactobacillus, pseudomonas, and bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited  in the genbank. sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. ttge and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative  differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

TI  == chemostat enrichments of human feces with resistant starch are selective for adherent butyrate-producing clostridia at high dilution rates.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) enrichments were made using chemostats inoculated with human feces from two individuals at two dilution rates (d = 0.03 h(-1) and d = 0.30 h(-1)) to select for slow- and fast-growing amylolytic communities. the fermentations were studied by analysis of short-chain fatty acids, amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities, and viable counts of the predominant culturable populations and the use of 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes. considerable butyrate was produced at d = 0. 30 h(-1), which corresponded with reduced branched-chain fatty acid formation. at both dilution rates, high levels of extracellular amylase activity were produced, while alpha-glucosidase was predominantly cell associated. bacteroides and bifidobacteria predominated at the low dilution rate, whereas saccharolytic clostridia became more important at d =  0.30 h(-1). microscopic examination showed that within 48 h of inoculation, one particular bacterial morphotype predominated in rs enrichments at d = 0.30 h(-1). this organism attached apically to rs granules and formed rosette-like structures which, with glycocalyx formation, agglomerated to form biofilm networks in the planktonic phase. attempts to isolate this bacterium in pure culture were repeatedly unsuccessful, although a single colony was eventually obtained. on the basis of its 16s rdna sequence, this rs-degrading, butyrate-producing organism was identified as being a previously unidentified group i clostridium sp. a 16s rrna-targeted probe was designed using this sequence and used to assess the abundance of the population in the enrichments. at 240 h, its contributions to total rrna in the chemostats were 5 and 23% at d = 0.03 and 0.30 h(-1), respectively. this study indicates that bacterial populations with significant metabolic potential can be overlooked using culture-based methodologies. this may provide a paradigm for explaining the discrepancy between the low numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria that are isolated from fecal samples and the actual production of butyrate.

TI  == sequence analysis of bacterial dna in the colon and stomach of the tyrolean iceman.
AB  == the male human body found in an alpine glacier on september 19, 1991 ("tyrolean iceman") has, for the first time in history, given scientists a chance to perform detailed anatomical, histological, and molecular investigations on the organs of  a person from the neolithic age (5350-5100 b.p.). in the present study, tissue samples aseptically taken from the stomach and the colon of the mummy were utilized for dna extraction, and the dna was pcr-amplified, using primer pairs designed to bind to fragments of the 16s ribosomal rna gene (16s rdna) of a broad range of bacteria. the pcr products were cloned in plasmid vectors, and the recombinant clones (amplicons) were sequenced. the sequence data were finally used for scanning data libraries containing the corresponding sequences of present-day bacteria, to infer the putative ecophysiology of the ancient ones. the same procedure was repeated on some fragments of grass from the clothing found near the corpse. these fragments were taken as a control of the microbiological situation of the glacier. the results show that the flora of the  iceman's stomach is entirely composed of burkholderia pickettii, an organism commonly found in aquatic habitats. the colon, on the other hand, contains several members of the fecal flora of humans, such as clostridium perfringens, c. ghonii, c. sordellii, eubacterium tenue, and bacteroides sp. the iceman's colon,  however, was found to contain, rather unexpectedly, also some members of the genus vibrio. the results are discussed in light of what is known about the preservation of microbial dna at the iceman's site and of previous parasitological studies performed on the iceman himself and on human coprolites.

TI  == antibiotic therapy attenuates colitis in interleukin 10 gene-deficient mice.
AB  == background & aims: interleukin (il)-10 gene-deficient mice, raised under germfree conditions, do not develop colitis, implying a role for bacteria. this study mapped the appearance of luminal colonic bacteria and, using antibiotic treatment, determined their association with colitis in il-10 gene-deficient mice. methods: mice were treated with ciprofloxacin or with neomycin and metronidazole. the intestine was harvested for histological scoring and bacterial assessment. results: at 2 weeks of age, before the development of colitis, il-10  gene-deficient mice demonstrated an earlier appearance of streptococcus and clostridium sp., and had a greater proportion (p < 0.01) of bacteria adherent to  the colonic mucosa. this pattern of increased adherent bacteria persisted for the 12 weeks of study. treatment of mice before the onset of colonic inflammation, with either antibiotic regime, reduced mucosal adherent bacteria and prevented colitis (p < 0.01). in contrast, treatment of established colitis with neomycin and metronidazole did not reduce adherent bacterial levels, yet was more efficacious (p < 0.05) in treating established colitis than ciprofloxacin, which  did reduce adherent colonic bacteria. conclusions: in the il-10 gene-deficient mouse model, the appearance and number of mucosal adherent colonic bacteria are altered before the onset of colitis. antibiotics both prevent and treat the colitis through correction of this primary bacterial alteration.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of t-3811me, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. t-3811, a free base of t-3811me, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in particular, t-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. t-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). t-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with gyra and parc (grla) mutations. the  activity of t-3811 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. in common with other fluoroquinolones, t-3811 was highly active against haemophilus  influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and legionella sp., with mic90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. t-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. t-3811 was the most active agent against c. trachomatis (mic, 0.008 microgram/ml) and m. pneumoniae (mic90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). the activity of t-3811 against m. tuberculosis (mic90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. in experimental systemic infection with a grla mutant of s. aureus and experimental  pneumonia with prsp in mice, t-3811me showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.

TI  == oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  == context: the oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. objective: to compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. patients: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. setting: santa casa de sao paulo emergency service. design: a blind prospective study. main outcomes measures: prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. results: the study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: bacteroides sp, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium sp, veilonella sp, peptostreptococcus sp, propionibacterium sp, bifidobacterium sp and clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). conclusion: based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the  choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.

TI  == cloning of an ef-p homologue from bacteroides fragilis that increases b. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods (bacteroides sp., prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. the pathogenicity of bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium, and afgpc was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and afgpc-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. as determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative  cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and also between most afgpc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == increase of mannose residues, as salmonella typhimurium-adhering factor, on the cecal mucosa of germ-free chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == to study increase of the salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. inhibition of s typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (d-mannose, d-galactose, l-fucose, alpha-methyl-d-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. only d-mannose had inhibitory effects. whereas, d-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of s typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose inhibited adherence of s typhimurium. d-mannose significantly (p < 0.05) increased adherence of bacteroides sp. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of clostridium perfringens and bifidobacterium thermophilum. under microscopic observation, only concanavalin a and lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. in e tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. these results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the  intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.

TI  == value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  == tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (bacteroides sp. and clostridium  sp.). to determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients),  treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. on average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. the common organisms were as expected: bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium sp. although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity  of bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.

TI  == [the role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  == altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species peptococcus  asacharolyticus, pc. sacharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides asacharolyticus and b. melaninogenicus. the remaining isolates were classified as bacteroides, fusobacterium, streptococcus and clostridium. in the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (tab. i) were carried out. their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (tab. ii). capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (tab. iii). in the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. the anaerobic genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of  the samples both species occurred). according to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. of the latter, those belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium are of major importance.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

AB  == aims: to compare ccfa (cycloserine, cefoxitin fructose agar) with a new selective medium cdmn (containing cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin, and moxalactam) for  the isolation of clostridium difficile after direct faecal culture. methods: the  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of c difficile, 17 strains of other clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with mic determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of clostridium sp and 15 isolates of bacteroides sp. using c difficile agar base with 0.5 g/l of cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with ccfa for the isolation of c difficile after direct faecal culture. results: norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of bacteroides sp tested, together with clostridium sp other than c difficile. using the antibiotics in combination (cdmn), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of c difficile were unaffected. when cdmn medium was compared with ccfa for the isolation of c difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea,  the cdmn agar isolated 20% more strains and reduced the number of contaminating colonies by 30%. conclusions: cdmn both improves the isolation rate of c difficile from faecal specimens and reduces the growth of other organisms compared with ccfa.

TI  == supplementation of an adapted formula with bovine lactoferrin: 1. effect on the infant faecal flora.
AB  == the development of the infant faecal flora was studied over the first three months of life in infants receiving breast milk, a modern adapted formula and adaptations of this formula. breast-fed infants developed a flora rich in bifidobacterium sp. facultative anaerobes were ubiquitous, but in relatively small numbers within the diet group. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium sp. and bacteriodes sp. were rarely isolated. standard formula produced a flora rich in bifidobacteria, but the growth of facultative organisms  was not suppressed by this diet. clostridium sp. and bacteroides sp. were more common in this feeding group. after the addition of lactoferrin at 10 mg/100 ml to the formula diet, a flora similar to that of the standard formula-fed babies was achieved. lactoferrin at 100 mg/100 ml was able to establish a "bifidus flora" in half of the babies given this formula, but only at age three months. clostridium sp. and bacteroides sp. were common faecal isolates from babies receiving both the lactoferrin diets.

TI  == the acute phase of experimental infection with trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 1. the influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain cl of trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic cfw (lob) mice monoassociated with bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp or clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. significantly earlier parasitemia peak  and mortality were observed in bacteroides fragilis- and clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). more precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. the extent  of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, b. fragilis-associated, clostridium-associated, and peptostreptococcus-associated animals. the levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, peptostreptococcus-associated, clostridium-associated, and b. fragilis-associated mice. 4. these results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with t. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. this suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with t. cruzi.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == apparition of clostridium sp. and bacteroides in the intestine of the newborn delivered by cesarian section.
AB  == anaerobic flora plays a key role in preventing intestinal colonization with potential pathogens. nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the colonization resistance provided by the anaerobic microflora are to be clarified. numerous factors seem to intervene in the regulation of the intestinal flora. the purpose  of the present study was to correlate the presence or relative absence of clostridium sp. and bacteroides with the colonization by c. perfringens, which is involved in lethal infections in an immunologically compromised host. the intestinal bacterial colonization of 20 newborns delivered by cesarian section was assessed sequentially over the first 14 days of life. c. perifringens is a strongly reducing microorganism and undoubtedly causes a decrease in the oxidoreduction potential of the newborn feces favouring the subsequent colonization by other putrefactive bacteria. c. perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of putrefractive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp.

AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

AB  == one hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1 to 2 gm cefotetan every 12 hours with those of 1 to 2 gm cefoxitin every 6 hours in patients with intra-abdominal infections. most of the infections were community acquired, were  associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. the clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin  group was 95%. bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. the incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). no clinically significant  differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results  of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in  hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == the present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. the results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range, mic50 and mic90. of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. mic90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas  maltophilia, enterococci, bacteroides sp. and clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/l. cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. all strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated  in each species. the need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == establishment of specific pathogen-free rabbits by inoculation of hysterectomy-derived rabbits with fecal suspension and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == establishment of a specific pathogen-free (spf) rabbit colony was attempted by transferring a total of 127 hysterectomy-derived rabbits directly into a barrier  room where spf rats had been reared. all rabbits except four died of mucoid enteritis-like diarrhea during 2 and 6 weeks of age. a second experiment consisted of four groups of hysterectomy-derived rabbits including: (1) noninoculated controls; (2) rabbits inoculated with suspension of feces from the  survivors; (3) rabbits inoculated with a bacterial inoculum (bacteroides spp. and eubacterium sp. isolated from conventional rabbits); and (4) rabbits inoculated with streptococcus faecalis in addition to the inoculum used for group 3. all rabbits in group 1 died of diarrhea by 3 weeks of age. survival rates of groups 2, 3 and 4 are 53%, 38% and 40%, respectively. on 7 days after the inoculation, bacteroides was not recovered from fecal samples of group 1, but was recovered from many samples of the inoculated groups. populations of enterobacteriaceae and clostridium in the samples in group 1 were larger than each of those in the inoculated groups. the present results suggest that the lethal diarrhea, after transferring hysterectomy-derived animals directly into a barrier room, can be controlled by inoculation with non-pathogenic anaerobes, especially bacteroides.

TI  == [effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  == norfloxacin (nflx), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing  53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). the actual regimen followed was that the drug  was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. on the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the  fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. susceptibilities  against nflx and nalidixic acid (na) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. of enterobacteriaceae was noted. the 3 strains other than e. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. no constant trend was observed in the isolation of proteus sp. organisms belong to enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2  cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. among other gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of plesiomonas sp. pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after  the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. however, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. no change was noticed in the number of isolates of enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for micrococcus  sp. and ylo. the average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. among anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antimicrobial substance from a human lactobacillus strain.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. strain gg, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. it inhibited anaerobic bacteria (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp. staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. the inhibitory activity occurred between ph 3 and 5 and was heat stable. bactericidal activity against escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. the inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. it had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == studies evaluating the in vitro and in vivo synergistic potential of combined antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria are reviewed. most studies evaluated therapy against bacteroides sp. (mostly bacteroides fragilis group). the combinations found to be most effective against b. fragilis were between metronidazole and clindamycin, spiramycin or gentamicin and between clindamycin and aminoglycosides. against bacteroides melaninogenicus the effective combinations were penicillin or clindamycin plus gentamicin and metronidazole and spiramycin or gentamicin. occasional synergy was observed against clostridium sp. and anaerobic cocci with clindamycin and gentamicin. synergistic combinations have the potential of clinical use in serious anaerobic infections.

TI  == antagonistic effect exerted by three strictly anaerobic strains against various strains of clostridium perfringens in gnotobiotic rodent intestines.
AB  == our purpose was to study bacterial antagonism between a limited number of strictly anaerobic strains and clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic rodents. gnotobiotic mice harboring a bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a fusobacterium necrogenes, and a clostridium sp. strain were protected against pathogenic b, c, and d c. perfringens serotypes. a drastic antagonistic effect of this three-strain association was also observed against a nonpathogenic c. perfringens serotype a (cpa). it was less efficient in gnotobiotic rats than in mice and less efficient in gnotobiotic mice fed an autoclaved diet than in mice fed the same diet sterilized by irradiation. no diffusible inhibitory substances  against cpa were detected in feces of gnotobiotic mice harboring the three antagonistic strains, and no nutrient depletion was demonstrated in filtrates prepared from 10-fold diluted feces of these mice. in vitro mixed cultures of the three antagonistic strains failed to inhibit growth of cpa, whereas cpa did not multiply in a 10-fold diluted feces from gnotobiotic mice. a reverse correlation  between the initial number of antagonistic strains and the division number of cpa was determined using serially diluted fecal suspensions. thus, large numbers of viable cells of both antagonistic strains were required to inhibit the target strain in fecal suspensions as was also found in gnotobiotic mice intestines. however, no diffusible inhibitory substance was detectable nor could depletion of growth factors be identified as causing antagonism. whatever factors that may be  responsible for antagonism were found to be influenced by the host and its diet.

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

(21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == the development of the normal intestinal microflora of the small intestine, caecum and large intestine of specific pathogen-free (spf) chickens, was studied  in the period from hatching to 84 days of age. no bacteria were detected in any of the sites at hatchery (day 1), but by day 3 significant levels of faecal streptococci and coliforms were isolated from all sites. the flora of the small intestine was limited to faecal streptococci and coliforms for the first 40 days  and then lactobacilli became established and dominated the flora. a large variety of facultative and strictly anaerobic organisms colonized the caecum. many of these species were transient and were only present for a limited period; after 40 days the flora stabilized to consist predominantly of faecal streptococci, escherichia coli, bacteroides spp. and lactobacillus sp. the flora of the large intestine was composed of organisms also present in the small intestine or the caecum. these findings differ from previously published studies on conventionally reared chickens in that the number of species isolated and the population levels  of organisms are much lower. this probably reflects the absence of continuous environmental challenge to the chickens because of the housing and feeding facilities in which the chickens were maintained.

AB  == roseburia cecicola strain gm is a motile obligate anaerobe that was isolated from mouse caecal mucosa. twenty-five strains of motility mutants were obtained from populations of strain gm (wild-type) that had been exposed to uv light. unlike gm cells, mutant bacteria were either non-motile and non-flagellated (fla-) or migrated slowly or atypically in semi-solid medium. strain gm and two mutant strains, sls (fla-) and wes (atypically motile), were used in mouse colonization  experiments. in separate experiments, each strain colonized (4.8 x 10(9) to 1.5 x 10(10) c.f.u. per g caecum) the caecum of germfree mice inoculated intragastrically with pure cultures of the bacteria. in mice mono-associated with either mutant strain, bacteria which were non-motile or atypically motile predominated in their caeca (greater than 99% of total bacteria recovered). in mice mono-associated with motile cells of strain gm, mutant strains which had lost wild-type motility became predominant in the caecal populations (97% of total bacteria recovered at 48 to 70 days after inoculation). mice mono-associated with either strain sls or strain gm were colonized by one strain  each of escherichia coli, candida pintolopesii, a bacteroides sp., and a clostridium sp. most (99%) of the r. cecicola cells recovered from the caeca of these animals had typical wild-type motility. motility, although not essential for r. cecicola to colonize germfree mice, is apparently advantageous to this bacterium when other micro-organisms are present with it in the mouse caecum. motility may thus be essential for r. cecicola to colonize conventional laboratory mice.

TI  == [antibacterial effects of niridazole. ii. effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. first, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as salmonella and escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole  is completely ineffective. there exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. the in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., fusobacterium spp. and peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. extremely low mic values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are  also relatively resistant to niridazole.

TI  == piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  == piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing s. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella sp and pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. the primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. piperacillin has been approved  for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. as with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. the usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. it is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == to evaluate the effects of parenteral cefoperazone therapy upon human fecal flora, fecal specimens obtained from four patients before and during therapy (as  well as after therapy for one patient) were cultured quantitatively for facultative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria and for fungi. cefoperazone therapy  was associated with major changes in fecal flora. there was suppression to undetectable levels or an appreciable reduction in all anaerobic bacteria as well as suppression of all initially detected enterobacteriaceae. during therapy, there was acquisition or an increase in counts of candida spp., so that these became the most numerous fecal microorganisms in all patients. in addition, pseudomonas spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. were acquired by three patients. these marked alterations in flora have potentially important consequences.

AB  == various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin a (iga) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. the mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. the  strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, eubacterium, actinobacillus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones)  are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera  bacteroides and escherichia have an immunogenic effect. the same result was obtained with bacteroides and escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. the kinetics of appearance of intestinal iga plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. the association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal iga plasmocytes as that  obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. the maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. the orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, e. coli and bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in 98 strains of anaerobic  bacteria that came from clinical samples against fosfomycin, penicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and lincomycin. the results obtained indicate that fosfomycin is usually inactive against bacteroides sp. and is active up to 32 mug/ml or less against 85% of peptococcus and 95% of peptostreptococcus, being consequently comparatively less active than the rest of the antibiotics that were tested against bacteroides, sp., while against peptococcus and peptostreptococcus it is less active than penicillin, cephalothin, clindamycin and lincomycin, and somewhat more active than chloramphenicol and tetracycline.

TI  == susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, sphaerophorus, veillonella, clostridium, corynebacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. all the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 peptococcaceae, including 21 peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 peptococcus variabilis; 65 corynebacterium acnes and 29 clostridium strains, including 13 c. perfringens) were sensitive (mic values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 bacteroides fragilis, 12 b. thetaiotaomicron, 7 b. vulgatus, 13 b. oralis, 4 b. melaninogenicus, 10 sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). erythromycin at concentrations of  6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 b. fragilis, 4 fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 sph. freundi, 10 sph. varius). the present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.

TI  == a special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel  and the rate of gas flow. cultures of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, c. septicum, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptococcus sp. and propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. all cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours  then incubated in a gaspak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared  to incubation only in the gaspak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == competitive effects of intestinal microflora on vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.

TI  == the relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
