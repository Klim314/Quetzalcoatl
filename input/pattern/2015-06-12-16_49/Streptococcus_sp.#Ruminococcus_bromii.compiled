TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
