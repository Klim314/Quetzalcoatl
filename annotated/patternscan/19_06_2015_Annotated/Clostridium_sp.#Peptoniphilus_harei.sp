TI  == peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. isolated from clinical specimens of human origin.
AB  == three groups of previously unknown gram-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. phenotypic and genotypic data demonstrate that these organisms are distinct, and  each group represents a previously unknown subline within clostridium cluster xiii. two groups are most closely related to peptoniphilus harei in the genus peptoniphilus, and the other group is most closely related to anaerococcus lactolyticus in the genus anaerococcus. based on the findings, three novel species, peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov., are proposed. the type strains of peptoniphilus  gorbachii sp. nov., peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. are wal 10418(t) (= ccug 53341(t) = atcc baa-1383(t)), wal 12922(t) (= ccug 53342(t) = atcc baa-1384(t)), and wal 17230(t) (= ccug 53340(t) = atcc baa-1385(t)), respectively.
