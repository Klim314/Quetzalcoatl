TI  - White-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  - White-spot lesions (WSL) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. We characterized the microbiota of WSL, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. Participants were 60 children with fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with WSL. Plaque samples were assayed by a 16S rRNA-based microarray (HOMIM) and by PCR. Mean gingival index was positively associated with WSL (p = 0.018). Taxa associated with WSL by microarray included Granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), Veillonellaceae sp. HOT 155 (p < 0.01), and Bifidobacterium Cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qPCR, Streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and Scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) Taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: Gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), Actinomyces sp. HOT 448 (p = 0.003), Prevotella cluster IV (p = 0.021), and Streptococcus sp. HOT 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of S. mutans (p = 0.02) and Bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qPCR. Species' associations with WSL were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without WSL. Granulicatella, Veillonellaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, in addition to S. mutans and S. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of WSL in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. Many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with WSL.
TI  - Clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. METHODS: Dental plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific PCR amplification for Streptococcus mutans and Bifidobacteriaceae species. RESULTS: Children with severe caries (n = 39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). Analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16S rRNA clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. Using the Human Oral Microbiome Database, 139 different taxa were identified. Within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included Granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and Veillonella sp. HOT-780 (p < 0.01). The species associated with caries-free children included Capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), Abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), Lachnospiraceae sp. HOT-100 (p < 0.05), Streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and Streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). By specific PCR, S. mutans (p < 0.005) and Bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the association of S. mutans with caries was from specific PCR analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
TI  - Characterization of the bacteriolytic activity of nutritionally variant streptococci.
AB  - The bacteriolytic activity of nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), fastidious microaerophilic bacteria, which are members of the genera Abiotrophia and Granulicatella, was characterized in a renaturating SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. Bacteriolytic profiles appeared quite different for the three species of NVS examined. Granulicatella adiacens or Abiotrophia defectiva each presented at least seven lytic bands, four of which were in common, while the other three were species-specific, whereas Granulicatella elegans showed six bands, which were overlapping with the G. adiacens bands. Four lytic bands were identified for enzymatic activity; D-alanyl-L-lysine hydrolase, endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase, endoacetylmuramidase, D-glutamyl-L-lysine hydrolase and acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activities could be defined. The bacteriolytic enzymes were purified and characterized for the kinetics of production during growth, autolytic activity, temperature and pH stability.
TI  - Granulicatella elegans bacteraemia in patients with abdominal infections.
AB  - Bloodstream infections with Granulicatella (previous Abiotrophia) elegans are rare. A few reported cases were associated with infective endocarditis. Three cases of bacteraemia with G. elegans in patients who were operated for acute abdominal diseases are described. Abdominal foci should be considered when G. elegans is recovered from blood.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  - Chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. Bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to assess the diversity of the flora present. Washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. The samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. Viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16S rDNA were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). Three sinus samples were positive by both PCR and culture methods, one was positive only by PCR, and one only by culture. Thirteen bacterial species were identified: Abiotrophia defectiva, Enterococcus avium, Eubacterium sp., Granulicatella elegans, Neisseria sp., Prevotella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sp. Fungi were not detected. In one patient Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis, and in another patient Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific PCR primers. These results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases.
TI  - Serological properties of Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species (nutritionally variant streptococci).
AB  - Serological variations were examined among 12 type or reference strains and 91 oral isolates of vitamin B6-dependent Abiotrophia and Granulicatella spp. Rabbits were immunized with whole cells of 12 selected strains and 10 typing antisera were obtained, which were unreactive with the Lancefield group A to G antigen preparations. The reactivity of the antisera and autoclaved cell surface antigen extracts was tested by double diffusion in agar gel and a capillary precipitin test. These typing antisera categorized all Abiotrophia defectiva strains, all except one Granulicatella elegans strain, three-quarters of the Granulicatella adiacens, and half of the Granulicatella paraadiacens into 8 serotypes and 2 subserotypes. The Granulicatella balaenopterae type strain was unserotypable. All A. defectiva strains were serotype I, some of which were divided into subserotype I-1 and/or I-5. The G. adiacens strains generally belonged to serotype II or III, and the G. paraadiacens strains to serotype IV, V or VI. All G. adiacens or G. paraadiacens serotype II strains were also subserotype I-5. The G. elegans strains were serotype VII or VIII. These Abiotrophia and Granulicatella serotypes were undetectable among 33 strains of the other 11 species including the bacteriolytic enzyme-producing but vitamin B6-independent strains of Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Dolosigranulum and Aerococcus. The proposed serotyping system for Abiotrophia and Granulicatella spp. would be helpful in the identification and classification of these unique coccal isolates in ecological and epidemiological studies.
