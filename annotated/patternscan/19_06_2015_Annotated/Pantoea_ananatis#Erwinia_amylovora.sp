TI  == identification of a pantoea biosynthetic cluster that directs the synthesis of an antimicrobial natural product.
AB  == fire blight is a destructive disease of apple and pear caused by the enteric bacterial pathogen, erwinia amylovora. e. amylovora initiates infection by colonizing the stigmata of apple and pear trees, and entering the plants through  natural openings. epiphytic populations of the related enteric bacterium, pantoea, reduce the incidence of disease through competition and antibiotic production. in this study, we identify an antibiotic from pantoea ananatis brt175, which is effective against e. amylovora and select species of pantoea. we used transposon mutagenesis to create a mutant library, screened approximately 5,000 mutants for loss of antibiotic production, and recovered 29 mutants. sequencing of the transposon insertion sites of these mutants revealed multiple independent disruptions of an 8.2 kb cluster consisting of seven genes, which appear to be coregulated. an analysis of the distribution of this cluster revealed that it was not present in any other of our 115 pantoea isolates, or in  any of the fully sequenced pantoea genomes, and is most closely related to antibiotic biosynthetic clusters found in three different species of pseudomonas. this identification of this biosynthetic cluster highlights the diversity of natural products produced by pantoea.

TI  == draft genome sequence of the antibiotic-producing epiphytic isolate pantoea ananatis brt175.
AB  == pantoea is a member of the enterobacteriaceae, whose members have been shown to produce novel antibiotics. here, we report the 4.8-mb genome sequence of pantoea  ananatis strain brt175, an epiphytic isolate from strawberries that produces an antibiotic that is effective against the fire blight pathogen, erwinia amylovora.
