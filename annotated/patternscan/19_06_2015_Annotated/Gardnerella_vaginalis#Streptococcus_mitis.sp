TI  == the diversity of receptor recognition in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are bacterial pore-forming toxins secreted mainly by pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. cdcs generally recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol to create pores and lyse target cells. however,  in contrast to typical cdcs such as streptolysin o, several atypical cdcs have been reported. the first of these was intermedilysin, which is secreted by streptococcus intermedius and has human cell-specificity, human cd59 (hucd59) being its receptor. in the study reported here, the diversity of receptor recognition among cdcs was investigated and multi-receptor recognition characteristics were identified within this toxin family. streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) secreted by s. mitis strain nm-65 isolated from a patient with kawasaki disease was previously shown to hemolyze erythrocytes in a species-dependent manner, its maximum activity being in human cells. in the present study, it was found that sm-hpaf recognizes  both membrane cholesterol and hucd59 as receptors for triggering pore-formation.  moreover, vaginolysin (vly) of gardnerella vaginalis showed similar characteristics to sm-hpaf regarding receptor recognition. on the basis of the results presented here, the mode of receptor recognition of cdcs can be categorized into the following three groups: (i) group i, comprising typical cdcs with high affinity to cholesterol and no or very little affinity to hucd59; (ii)  group ii, including atypical cdcs such as ily, with no or very little affinity to cholesterol and high affinity to hucd59; and (iii) group iii, which contains atypical cdcs such as sm-hpaf and vly with affinity to both cholesterol and hucd59.

TI  == profiles of ily, vly and sm-hpaf interaction with human cd59.
AB  == background: the molecular features of a new member of the bacterially -derived cytolysin family were examined. in particular, the interactive mechanisms of intermedilysin (ily), vaginolysin (vly), and streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) with human cd59 (hcd59) were analyzed. materials and methods: molecular models of vly and sm-hpaf were constructed based on x-ray data of ily (protein data bank id=1s3r), and their interactive profiles  with hcd59 were examined using molecular simulation. results: non-binding (nb) energy between ily and hcd59 was three orders of magnitude higher than the energy between vly and hcd59. nb energy between sm-hpaf and hcd59 was similar to that between vly and hcd59. conclusion: a hydrogen bond (ily arg432-hcd59 glu76) was observed between ily and hcd59, and a stronger interaction was formed by flexible adjustment between them.

TI  == [the isolation of streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  == we have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by gynecology service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. we achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58  (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to streptococcus morbillorum 9  (15.5%), to gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to enterococcus faecalis-durans and to streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis ii respectively. we previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. the bacteriological identification done by the api 20 strep system (biomerieux gmbh, nutingen, germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the streptococcus morbillorum.
