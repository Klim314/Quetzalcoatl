TI  == synthesis, characterization, theoretical, anti-bacterial and molecular docking studies of quinoline based chalcones as a dna gyrase inhibitor.
AB  == a series of fourteen (a1-a14) new qunioline based chalcones were synthesized by condensing 2,7-dichloro-8-methyl-3-formyl quinoline with acetophenone and acetylthiophenes, and subsequently characterized by ir, nmr and mass spectroscopy. all the compounds were screened for antibacterial activities and found potentially active antibacterial agents. bioassay, theoretical and dockings studies with dna gyrase (the enzyme required for super coiling of dna of bacteria) results showed that the type and positions of the substituents seemed to be critical for their antibacterial activities. the bromo and chloro substituted chalcone displayed high anti-bacterial activity. the a4 and a6 showed high interaction with dna gyrase, contributing high free binding energy (deltag -8.18 and -8.88 kcal).

TI  == eco-friendly synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of some novel chalcones.
AB  == chalcone derivatives have been synthesized by reaction of 1-(2,5-dimethyl-furan-3-yl)-ethanone with corresponding active aldehyde in ethanolic naoh in microwave oven. the structure of these compounds was established by elemental analysis, ir, 1h-nmr, 13c-nmr, and ei-ms spectral analysis. the anti-bacterial activity of these compounds was first tested in vitro by the disc diffusion assay against two gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria, and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined with the reference of standard drug chloramphenicol. the results showed that pyrazol containing chalcone (compound 8) inhibited both types of bacteria (gram-positive  and gram-negative) better than chloramphenicol.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == computational analysis of bacterial rna-seq data.
AB  == recent advances in high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes. however, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have  not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by rna-seq technology. here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of rna-seq data. the algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial rna-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing  reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. we demonstrate the performance of rockhopper  using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 rna-seq experiments conducted with escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, salmonella enterica, streptococcus pyogenes and xenorhabdus nematophila. we find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from e. coli and n. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small rnas, operons and transcription start sites. our  results suggest that rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial rna-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == antibacterial activity and dual mechanisms of peptide analog derived from cell-penetrating peptide against salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a number of research have proven that antimicrobial peptides are of greatest potential as a new class of antibiotics. antimicrobial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides share some similar structure characteristics. in our study, a new peptide analog, app (glaraltrllrqltrqltra) from the cell-penetrating peptide pptg20 (glfrallrllrslwrlllra), was identified simultaneously with the antibacterial mechanism of app against salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pyogenes. app displayed potent antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive strains. the minimum inhibitory concentration was in the range of 2 to 4 mum. app displayed higher cell selectivity (about 42-fold increase) as compared to the parent peptide for it decreased hemolytic activity and increased  antimicrobial activity. the calcein leakage from egg yolk l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (eypc)/egg yolk l-alpha-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol and  eypc/cholesterol vesicles demonstrated that app exhibited high selectivity. the antibacterial mechanism analysis indicated that app induced membrane permeabilization in a kinetic manner for membrane lesions allowing o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside uptake into cells and potassium release from app-treated cells. flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that app induced bacterial live cell membrane damage. circular dichroism, fluorescence spectra, and gel retardation analysis confirmed that app interacted with dna and intercalated into the dna base pairs after penetrating the cell membrane. cell cycle assay showed that app affected dna synthesis in the cell. our results suggested that peptides derived from the cell-penetrating peptide have the potential for antimicrobial agent development, and app exerts its antibacterial activity by damaging bacterial cell membranes and binding to bacterial dna to inhibit cellular functions, ultimately leading to cell death.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our  knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)]  and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested,  while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for  this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == the airway antigen sampling system: respiratory m cells as an alternative gateway for inhaled antigens.
AB  == in this study, we demonstrated a new airway ag sampling site by analyzing tissue  sections of the murine nasal passages. we revealed the presence of respiratory m  cells, which had the ability to take up ova and recombinant salmonella typhimurium expressing gfp, in the turbinates covered with single-layer epithelium. these m cells were also capable of taking up respiratory pathogen group a streptococcus after nasal challenge. inhibitor of dna binding/differentiation 2 (id2)-deficient mice, which are deficient in lymphoid tissues, including nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, had a similar frequency of m cell clusters in their nasal epithelia to that of their littermates, id2(+/-) mice. the titers of ag-specific abs were as high in id2(-/-) mice as in id2(+/-) mice after nasal immunization with recombinant salmonella-toxc or group a streptococcus, indicating that respiratory m cells were capable of sampling inhaled bacterial ag to initiate an ag-specific immune response. taken together, these findings suggest that respiratory m cells act as  a nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue-independent alternative gateway for ag sampling and subsequent induction of ag-specific immune responses in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == synthesis of ag/cnt hybrid nanoparticles and fabrication of their nylon-6 polymer nanocomposite fibers for antimicrobial applications.
AB  == ag-coated cnts hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (dmf) and silver (i) acetate precursors in the presence of cnts. the morphology of ag/cnts was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques. the nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% ag/cnts mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. the dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. the nylon-6/ag/cnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite (hpnc) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their  tensile properties. the failure stress and modulus of the extruded hpnc fibers (doped with 1% ag/cnts) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded nylon-6 fiber, respectively. dsc results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for hpnc fibers. the antibacterial activity of the ag-coated cnts, commercial ag, neat nylon-6 and plain cnts were evaluated. ag-coated cnts at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the kirby-bauer assay. the mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus  pyogenes, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. by comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. the zones of inhibition obtained for nylon-6 ag-coated cnt powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. further, the nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with ag/cnts inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with ag-coated cnts have significant antimicrobial activity.

TI  == ndp52, a novel autophagy receptor for ubiquitin-decorated cytosolic bacteria.
AB  == autophagy functions as a cell-autonomous effector mechanism of innate immunity by separating bacteria from cytosolic resources and delivering them for lysosomal destruction. how cytosolic bacteria are targeted for autophagy is incompletely understood. we recently discovered that salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium  and streptococcus pyogenes are detected by ndp52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kda), after these bacteria enter the cytosol of human cells and become decorated with polyubiquitinated proteins. ndp52 binds the bacterial ubiquitin coat as well as atg8/lc3 and delivers cytosolic bacteria into autophagosomes. in the absence of ndp52 ubiquitin-coated bacteria accumulate outside atg8/lc3(+) autophagosomes. cells lacking ndp52 fail to restrict bacterial proliferation, as do cells depleted of tbk1, an ikk family kinase colocalizing with ndp52 at the bacterial surface. our findings demonstrate the existence of a receptor for the selective autophagy of cytosolic bacteria, suggesting that cells are able to differentiate  between antibacterial and other forms of autophagy.

TI  == the interaction of the antimicrobial peptide cleap-2 and the bacterial membrane.
AB  == chicken liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (cleap-2) is known to have killing activities against salmonella spp., but the mechanism by which killing occurs remains to be elucidated. the ability of cleap-2 to disrupt the outer membrane of several salmonella spp. was assessed using the fluorescent probe n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (npn). a rapid dose-dependent permeabilization of the outer membranes of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phop, and s. enterica  serovar typhimurium sl1344 was observed although no significant permeabilisation  of the s. enteriditis membrane was detected. these data suggested that the ability of the mature cleap-2 peptide to permeabilise the salmonella outer membrane is important in mediating its killing activities. the ability of the peptide to kill gram-positive bacteria, specifically streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. was also investigated using recombinant peptide and a time-kill assay. of the strains analysed the streptococcus pyogenes m1 strain appeared the most resistant to leap-2 killing although s. pyogenes mutants deficient in sortase and m1 activities showed increased sensitivity to the mature peptide. this suggested the involvement of specific streptococcus cell wall proteins including m1 in the resistance of the bacteria to cleap-2 killing. cleap-2 showed no significant toxicity towards mammalian erythrocytes indicating  selectivity for bacterial over eukaryote cell membranes. these data provide further support for mature cleap-2 functioning in protecting the chicken against  microbial attack.

TI  == correlations between carbon metabolism and virulence in bacteria.
AB  == bacteria have developed several mechanisms which allow the preferred utilization  of the most efficiently metabolizable carbohydrates when these organisms are exposed to a mixture of carbon sources. interestingly, the same or similar mechanisms are used by some pathogens to control various steps of their infection process. the efficient metabolism of a carbon source might serve as signal for proper fitness. alternatively, the presence of a specific carbon source might indicate to bacterial cells that they thrive in infection-related organs, tissues or cells and that specific virulence genes should be turned on or switched off. frequently, virulence gene regulators are affected by changes in carbon source availability. for example, expression of the gene encoding the streptococcus pyogenes virulence regulator mga is controlled by the classical carbon catabolite repression (ccr) mechanism operative in firmicutes. the activity of prfa, the major virulence regulator in listeria monocytogenes, seems to be controlled by the phosphorylation state of phosphotransferase system(pts) components. in vibrio cholerae synthesis of hapr, which regulates the expression of genes required for  motility, is controlled via the crp/camp ccr mechanism, whereas synthesis of salmonella enterica hile, which represses genes in a pathogenicity island, is regulated by the carbohydrate-responsive, pts-controlled mlc.

AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == skim milk enhances the preservation of thawed -80 degrees c bacterial stocks.
AB  == the results from bacterial strain recovery efforts following hurricanes katrina and rita are reported. over 90% of strains frozen in 10% skim milk were recovered whereas various recovery rates were observed for glycerol-stored stocks (56% and  94% of escherichia coli, depending upon the laboratory). these observations led to a viability comparison of streptococcus pyogenes, campylobacter jejuni, borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella enterica subsp. typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. coli strains stored in glycerol or skim milk. in all bacteria examined, 10% skim milk resulted in significantly longer viability after thawing  than 15% glycerol solutions currently used in most laboratories.

TI  == secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  == objectives: the intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. antibacterial protection is provided in part by paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. the mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with crohn's ileitis. in the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small  intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying  mucus and the luminal content. methods: preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. results: the secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. the extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). a spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: these findings show that secreted antimicrobial  peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. this distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == tbk1 protects vacuolar integrity during intracellular bacterial infection.
AB  == tank-binding kinase-1 (tbk1) is an integral component of type i interferon induction by microbial infection. the importance of tbk1 and type i interferon in antiviral immunity is well established, but the function of tbk1 in bacterial infection is unclear. upon infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella), more extensive bacterial proliferation was observed in tbk1(-/-) than tbk1(+/+) cells. tbk1 kinase activity was required for restriction of bacterial infection, but interferon regulatory factor-3 or type i interferon did not contribute to this tbk1-dependent function. in tbk1(-/-)cells, salmonella, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and streptococcus pyogenes escaped from vacuoles into the cytosol where increased replication occurred, which suggests that tbk1 regulates  the integrity of pathogen-containing vacuoles. knockdown of tbk1 in macrophages and epithelial cells also resulted in increased bacterial localization in the cytosol, indicating that the role of tbk1 in maintaining vacuolar integrity is relevant in different cell types. taken together, these data demonstrate a requirement for tbk1 in control of bacterial infection distinct from its established role in antiviral immunity.

AB  == in this chapter, an overview of in vivo induced antigen technology (iviat) and change mediated antigen technology (cmat) will be presented, including a discussion of the advantages and limitations of these methods. over fifteen different microbial pathogens have been or are known to be currently studied with these methods. salient data obtained from the application of iviat and/or cmat to a selection of human and plant pathogens will be summarized. this includes recent reports on streptococcus pyogenes (group a) in neurological disorders and invasive diseases, xylella fastidiosa in pierce's disease, xanthomonas campestris in bean blight, salmonella enterica serovar typhi in typhoid fever and leishmania spp. related infections. special emphasis will be given to those targets that have been further investigated for the development of novel vaccine, diagnostic and/or antibiotherapy strategies. this encompasses a new point-of-care serological diagnostic test for chronic periodontal diseases. finally, mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo induced products will be described as providing a rational basis for differentiating subjects with primary, dormant or  secondary tuberculosis infections, from control subjects who have or did not have prior vaccination with bcg.

TI  == tlr4-dependent hepcidin expression by myeloid cells in response to bacterial pathogens.
AB  == hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by the liver during inflammation that plays a central role in mammalian iron homeostasis. here we demonstrate the  endogenous expression of hepcidin by macrophages and neutrophils in vitro and in  vivo. these myeloid cell types produced hepcidin in response to bacterial pathogens in a toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-dependent fashion. conversely, bacterial stimulation of macrophages triggered a tlr4-dependent reduction in the  iron exporter ferroportin. in vivo, intraperitoneal challenge with pseudomonas aeruginosa induced tlr4-dependent hepcidin expression and iron deposition in splenic macrophages, findings mirrored in subcutaneous infection with group a streptococcus where hepcidin induction was further observed in neutrophils migrating to the tissue site of infection. hepcidin expression in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice infected with bacteria was independent of tlr4, suggesting the tlr4-hepcidin pathway is restricted to myeloid cell types. our findings identify endogenous myeloid cell hepcidin production as a previously unrecognized component of the host response to bacterial pathogens.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == bacterial responses to neutrophil phagocytosis.
AB  == purpose of review: this review focuses on adaptive bacterial interactions with neutrophils, emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or phagocytosis by pmn. recent findings: since the discovery of type iii and iv secretion, progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host phagocytes has been extensive but largely focused on the macrophage. the remarkable growth of information about bacterial subversion of macrophage metabolism has been summarized in several excellent reviews. the scope of progress on neutrophil-bacteria interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the granulocyte pathogen, anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis. summary: for many pathogens, contact with or ingestion by phagocytes elicits a vigorous but varied microbial response. the response repertoire includes activation of type iii and type iv secretion systems that inject effector molecules into the host cell. effectors modify host cell signaling and metabolic pathways to favor survival of the microbe. whereas microbial secretory structures are few in kind and relatively conserved, effector molecules are numerous and variable. effectors may promote phagocytosis by nonphagocytic cells or suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. they may suppress assembly or misdirect localization of the phagocyte nadph oxidase that is responsible for generating toxic oxidants, and they may suppress phagosome-lysosome fusion. phagocytosed bacteria may also up-regulate the expression of defensive proteins that attenuate the effects of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial toxins. these pathogenic stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among single-celled organisms, eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, that arose early in evolution.

TI  == m1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group a streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  == invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. m protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells  by group a streptococcus (gas) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. in this study, we investigated the role of m1 protein from serotype m1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. ly294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors  of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-k) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by gas by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of pi 3-k, respectively, were less able to be invaded by gas. to separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from m protein, lactococcus lactis was engineered to express m1 protein on its surface. l. lactis(plm1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and pi 3-k inhibitors blocked 90% of this  invasion. purified soluble m1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. ly294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. a phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by gas. therefore, m1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase pi 3-k pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium.

TI  == common themes among bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors and diversity among the bacteriophages involved.
AB  == there are common themes among bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors, which include the well-characterized bacterial toxins and proteins that alter antigenicity as well as several new classes of bacteriophage-encoded proteins such as superantigens, effectors translocated by a type iii secretion system, and proteins required for intracellular survival and host cell attachment. these virulence factors are encoded by a diversity of bacteriophages, members of the viral families siphoviridae, podoviridae, myoviridae and inoviridae, with some bacteriophages having characteristics of more than one virus family. the location of virulence genes within the bacteriophage genomes is non-random and consistent  with an origin via imprecise prophage excision or as either transferable cassettes or integral components of the bacteriophage genome.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of caenorhabditis elegans by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas  aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill c. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. we examined c. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. we demonstrate that s. pyogenes kills c. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. unlike p. aeruginosa and s. enterica serovar typhimurium, the killing by s. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. major exotoxins of s. pyogenes are not involved in  the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout  mutants. moreover, no accumulation of s. pyogenes in c. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. preliminary results show that s. pneumoniae can also kill c. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill c. elegans.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == borrelia burgdorferi and other bacterial products induce expression and release of the urokinase receptor (cd87).
AB  == the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (upar, cd87) is a highly glycosylated 55- to 60-kda protein anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety that promotes the acquisition of plasmin on the surface of cells and subsequent cell movement and migration by binding urokinase-type plasminogen activator. upar also occurs in a soluble form in body  fluids and tumor extracts, and both membrane and soluble upar are overexpressed in patients with tumors. upar may be a factor in inflammatory disorders as well.  we investigated whether borrelia burgdorferi could stimulate up-regulation of cell membrane upar in vitro. b. burgdorferi, purified native outer surface protein a, and a synthetic outer surface protein a hexalipopeptide stimulated human monocytes to up-regulate membrane upar as measured by immunofluorescence/facs and western blot. the presence of soluble upar in culture supernatants, measured by ag capture elisa, was also observed. lps from salmonella typhimurium and lipotechoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes also induced the up-regulation of both membrane and soluble upar protein by monocytes. up-regulation of upar was induced by conditioned medium from b. burgdorferi/monocyte cocultures. the up-regulation of upar by b. burgdorferi was  concomitant with an increase in upar mrna, indicating that synthesis was de novo. the expression and release of upar in response to b. burgdorferi and other bacterial components suggests a role in the pathogenesis of lyme disease as well  as in other bacterial infections.

TI  == novel functions of human alpha(1)-protease inhibitor after s-nitrosylation: inhibition of cysteine protease and antibacterial activity.
AB  == alpha(1)-protease inhibitor (alpha(1)pi), the most abundant serine protease inhibitor found in human plasma (at 30-60 microm), is a glycoprotein (53 kda) having a single cysteine residue at position 232 (cys(232)). we have found that cys(232) of human alpha(1)pi was readily s-nitrosylated by nitric oxide (no) without affecting inhibitory activity to trypsin or elastase. s-nitrosylated alpha(1)pi (s-no-alpha(1)pi) not only retained inhibitory activity against these  serine proteases, but also gained thiol protease inhibitory activity against a streptococcus pyogenes protease; the parental alpha(1)pi did not have this activity. furthermore, s-no-alpha(1)pi exhibited bacteriostatic activity against  salmonella typhimurium at concentrations of 0.1-10 microm, which were 20- to 3000-fold stronger than those of the other no-generating compounds or s-nitroso compounds such as s-nitrosoalbumin and s-nitrosoglutathione. no appears to be transferred into the bacterial cells from s-no-alpha(1)pi via transnitrosylation, as evidenced by electron spin resonance spectroscopy with an no spin trap. thus,  we conclude that s-no-alpha(1)pi may be generated from the reaction between alpha(1)pi and no under inflammatory conditions, in which production of both is known to increase. as a result, new functions, i.e., antibacterial and thiol protease inhibitory activities of alpha(1)pi, were generated.

AB  == the plasmid-encoded gene cluster for o:54 o-polysaccharide synthesis in salmonella enterica serovar borreze (rfbo:54) contains three genes that direct synthesis of a mannac homopolymer with alternating beta1,3 and beta1,4 linkages.  in escherichia coli k-12, rfbao:54 adds the first mannac residue to the rfe (udp-glcpnac::undecaprenylphosphate glcpnac-1-phosphate transferase)- modified lipopolysaccharide core. hydrophobic cluster analysis of rfbao:54 indicates this  protein belongs to the exou family of nonprocessive beta-glycosyltransferases. two putative catalytic residues and a potential substrate-binding motif were identified in rfbao:54. topological analysis of rfbbo:54 predicts four transmembrane domains and a large central cytoplasmic domain. the latter shares homology with a similar domain in the processive beta-glycosyltransferases cps3s  of streptococcus pneumoniae and hasa of streptococcus pyogenes. hydrophobic cluster analysis of rfbbo:54 and cps3s indicates both possess the structural features characteristic of the hasa family of processive beta-glycosyltransferases. four potential catalytic residues and a putative substrate-binding motif were identified in rfbbo:54. in deltarfb e. coli k-12, rfbao:54 and rfbbo:54 direct synthesis of smooth o:54 lipopolysaccharide, indicating that this o-polysaccharide involves a novel pathway for o-antigen transport. based on sequence and structural conservation, 15 new exou-related and 17 new hasa-related transferases were identified.

TI  == molecular, genetic, and topological characterization of o-antigen chain length regulation in shigella flexneri.
AB  == the rfb region of shigella flexneri encodes the proteins required to synthesize the o-antigen component of its cell surface lipopolysaccharides (lps). we have previously reported that a region adjacent to rfb was involved in regulating the  length distribution of the o-antigen polysaccharide chains (d. f. macpherson et al., mol. microbiol. 5:1491-1499, 1991). the gene responsible has been identified in escherichia coli o75 (called rol [r. a. batchelor et al., j. bacteriol. 173:5699-5704, 1991]) and in e. coli o111 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain lt2 (called cld [d. a. bastin et al., mol. microbiol. 5:2223-2231, 1991]). through a combination of subcloning, deletion, and transposon insertion analysis, we have identified a gene adjacent to the s. flexneri rfb region which encodes a protein of 36 kda responsible for the length  distribution of o-antigen chains in lps as seen on silver-stained sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. dna sequence analysis identified an open reading frame (orf) corresponding to the rol gene. the corresponding protein was almost identical in sequence to the rol protein of e. coli o75 and was highly homologous to the functionally identical cld proteins of e. coli o111 and s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2. these proteins, together with orf o349 adjacent to rfe,  had almost identical hydropathy plots which predict membrane-spanning segments at the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends and a hydrophilic central region. we isolated a number of tnphoa insertions which inactivated the rol gene, and the fusion end points were determined. the phoa+ rol::phoa fusion proteins had phoa fused within the large hydrophilic central domain of rol. these proteins were located in the whole-membrane fraction, and extraction with triton x-100 indicated a cytoplasmic membrane location. this finding was supported by sucrose  density gradient fractionation of the whole-cell membranes and of e. coli maxicells expressing l-[35s]methionine-labelled rol protein. hence, we interpret  these data to indicate that the rol protein is anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane via its amino- and carboxy-terminal ends but that the majority of the protein is located in the periplasmic space. to confirm that rol is responsible for the effects on o-antigen chain length observed with the cloned rfb genes in e. coli k-12, it was mutated in s. flexneri by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cartridge. the resulting strains produced lps with o antigens of nonmodal chain length, thereby confirming the function of the rol gene product. we propose a model for the function of rol protein in which it acts as a type of  molecular chaperone to facilitate the interaction of the o-antigen ligase (rfal)  with the o-antigen polymerase (rfc) and polymerized, acyl carrier lipid-linked, o-antigen chains. analysis of the dna sequence of the region identified a number  of orfs corresponding to the well-known gnd and hisie genes. the rol gene was located immediately downstream of two orfs with sequence similarity to the gene encoding udpglucose dehydrogenase (hasb) of streptococcus pyogenes. the orfs arise because of a deletion or frameshift mutation within the gene we have termed udg (for udpglucose dehydrogenase).

AB  == the primary structure of bovine liver udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udpgdh), a hexameric, nad(+)-linked enzyme, has been determined at the protein level. the 52-kda subunits are composed of 468 amino acid residues, with a free n-terminus and a ser/asn microhetergeneity at one position. the sequence shares 29.6% positional identity with gdp-mannose dehydrogenase from pseudomonas, confirming a similarity earlier noted between active site peptides. this degree of similarity  is comparable to the 31.1% identity vs. the udpgdh from type a streptococcus. database searching also revealed similarities to a hypothetical sequence from salmonella typhimurium and to "udp-n-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase"  from escherichia coli. pairwise identities between bovine udpgdh and each of these sequences were all in the range of approximately 26-34%. multiple alignment of all 5 sequences indicates common ancestry for these 4-electron-transferring enzymes. there are 27 strictly conserved residues, including a cysteine residue at position 275, earlier identified by chemical modification as the expected catalytic residue of the second half-reaction (conversion of udp-aldehydoglucose  to udp-glucuronic acid), and 2 lysine residues, at positions 219 and 338, one of  which may be the expected catalytic residue for the first half-reaction (conversion of udp-glucose to udp-aldehydoglucose). a gxgxxg pattern characteristic of the coenzyme-binding fold is found at positions 11-16, close to the n-terminus as with "short-chain" alcohol dehydrogenases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a new alpha-helical coiled coil protein encoded by the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid.
AB  == a new protein of salmonella typhimurium was identified and characterized. the gene (tlpa) encoding this protein (tlpa) was isolated from the large virulence-associated plasmid of s. typhimurium and sequenced in order to predict  the primary structure of tlpa. tlpa encodes a 371-amino acid soluble protein with a calculated m(r) of 41600 and pi of 4.63. secondary structure predictions and sequence statistics of tlpa indicated a predominant alpha-helical configuration and presence of heptapeptide repeat motifs characteristic of coiled coil proteins. purified tlpa was shown to have biochemical properties similar to those of coiled coil proteins, including adoption of an alpha-helical configuration and a tendency to form homodimers. furthermore, tlpa possessed heat resistance, evidence for a chain register and altered mobility in urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels which are characteristics of tropomyosins. tlpa shows 32% overall sequence similarity with rat cardiac myosin  and 36% similarity with horse platelet beta-tropomyosin over 226 residues, whereas selected regions possessed significant sequence identities with myosins,  tropomyosins, and alpha-helical surface proteins of streptococcus pyogenes. our results indicate that tlpa represents a new member of prokaryotic coiled coil proteins.

TI  == requirement of the conformational stability of a salmonella ribosomal vaccine for its mouse protection.
AB  == the 43-kda non-o antigenic component isolated from the crude ribosomal fraction of salmonella typhimurium [9] was further purified by affinity chromatography (43-kda protein: 43-kdp). immunization with 43-kdp did not induce complete mouse  protection in cf1 mice to 500 ld50 of s. typhimurium, although it elicited a substantial igg antibody response. the 43-kdp exhibited the mitogenicity to splenocytes (cf1 and c3h/hej) and b cell-rich populations (cf1). complexing 43-kdp with the compact ribosomes of streptococcus pyogenes by formaldehyde (complex vaccine: cv) elicited both igm and igg antibodies to 43-kdp. cv induced  a boosting effect to enhance igg antibody response. moreover, cv generated delayed-type hypersensitivity to salmonella antigens and also conferred complete  protection against 500 ld50 challenge of s. typhimurium to cf1 mice. these abilities of cv were reduced or impaired by rnase digestion. cv was able to induce partial or complete protection in inbred mouse strains (c3h/hen, c3h/hej,  dba/2 and a/j). these data, in addition to other reports, suggest that conformational stability between ribosomes and contaminating substances such as 43-kdp or o-antigens might be required for the overall effects of the ribosomal vaccine.

TI  == effect of immune globulin intravenous on opsonization of bacteria by classic and  alternative complement pathways in premature serum.
AB  == the mechanisms involved in the effect of immune globulin intravenous (igiv) on bacterial opsonization by both complement pathways in premature serum were elucidated in this study. of the bacteria used, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis were nonencapsulated while streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli 07 k1 were encapsulated. as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, igiv showed specific antibody titers of 1:32 for s. aureus and s. enteritidis and of 1:8 for s. pyogenes and e. coli 07 k1. igiv alone had no direct opsonic activity against these organisms. addition of igiv did not alter the opsonic activity of normal adult serum against these organisms. in contrast, addition of igiv promoted the opsonic activity of premature serum against the nonencapsulated bacteria to levels matching that in normal adult serum. the igiv preparation significantly improved the opsonization of bacteria by the classic (from 39 to 68% of that in adult serum) and alternative (from 22 to 97% of that in adult serum) complement pathways in premature serum. igiv also  markedly augmented c3 deposition on the bacteria by both complement pathways. these studies suggest that igiv containing high titers of specific antibodies promote opsonization of bacteria by the enhancement of complement pathway activation, especially the alternative pathway, in premature serum.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == mycotic carotid aneurysm.
AB  == mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery are rare; they usually appear as an enlarging pulsatile neck mass with associated pain, tenderness, and fever. this case report illustrates the need for prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention. the most common organisms found with these aneurysms have been staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. we report a case of a mycotic internal carotid artery aneurysm resulting from salmonella enteritidis. a 20-year review of both the foreign and english language literature revealed only one other case of a mycotic carotid aneurysm resulting from salmonella infection. the cornerstone of therapy in the past had been proximal ligation. more recently, primary reconstructive procedures with either an end-to-end anastomosis or an interposition vein graft have been described. the present case was managed with an end-to-end technique with the use of a pruitt-inahara shunt.

TI  == comparison of inflammatory reactions induced by intraarticular injection of bacterial cell wall polymers.
AB  == cell wall polymers isolated from group a streptococci, as well as lipopolysaccharide from salmonella typhimurium and synthetic muramyl dipeptide, were injected into the ankle joints of rats. the inflammatory responses were assessed by gross and histologic examination, and edema was measured by accumulation of radiolabeled albumin in the limbs. the isolated group-specific polysaccharide induced extensive edema of the articular and periarticular tissue  immediately after injection, and this resolved in 24 hours. the peptidoglycan moiety did not produce early edema, but induced an acute exudative reaction followed by a proliferative synovitis which resolved after 5 days. reactions induced by covalently bound complexes of peptidoglycan and the group-specific polysaccharide (pg-aps) varied, depending on the size of the complex. small fragments, derived from mutanolysin digestion, caused both an acute edematous reaction and transient arthritis. larger fragments did not cause the immediate edematous reaction, but induced an acute arthritis that appeared within 24 hours  and evolved into a chronic process. episodes of recurrent inflammation, a distinctive feature of joint inflammation induced by systemic injection of pg-aps polymers, were not observed following intraarticular injection of any of the cell wall polymers. the relative susceptibility of different rat strains to arthritis  induced by intraarticular injection paralleled the responses to systemic injection of pg-aps. these results demonstrate that variations in arthropathogenicity are due, in part, to inherent differences in the phlogistic activities of different cell wall polymers, and that the genetic control of susceptibility involves regulation of the inflammatory responses rather than the  quantity of cell wall distributed to the joint.

TI  == a genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in bsvs mice is not responsible for the limited t-dependent immune responsiveness of bsvs mice.
AB  == bsvs mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. we have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between bsvs and salmonella-resistant a/j mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to h-2, igh-c, or hbb, and not x-linked. we have backcrossed the a/j allele at this locus into bsvs mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor t-dependent responsiveness of bsvs mice. the salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the ity locus described by others.

AB  == in normal rabbits and mice, one i.v. injection of scarlet fever toxin (et) (30 000 std per kg of rabbit weight or 20-g mouse) elicited a similar biphasic change in carbon clearance rate - early depression followed by a stimulating phase - as  has been described for gram-negative endotoxins. prolonged depression without a subsequent stimulation phase was obtained in mice by raising the et dose. the reasons of the discrepancy between these findings and those of hanna and watson (1965b) are discussed. pyrogenic tolerance to et is not accompanied by accelerated carbon clearance and is not impaired by res blockade. a possible mechanism of et tolerance is suggested.

AB  == large bodies appear at the time of protoplast and spheroplast formation and are revealed at all the l-transformation stages and at the initial stage of reversion. they can be represented both by a single giant cell and by a conglomerate of different cells connected with one another. they are not only spheroid, but can be of the most varied shape, and structurally they are connected with other l-colony elements: filamentous structures, spheroid cells, elementary bodies and the so-called acellular material. at the early l-transformation stage the large bodies probably appear as a result of coalescence of lysed cells and represent polygenome formations. elementary bodies and spheroid cells form within the large bodies and on their surface at the late  stage of l-transformation. in case of reversion bacterial cells form from them.

TI  == effect of capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. i. induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  == when klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (cps-k) from type 1, kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with salmonella enteritidis nub 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with s.  enteritidis nub 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. the promotion of infection with s. enteritidis nub 1 by cps-k depended upon its dose, the effect of cps-k being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. in the case of s. enteritidis nub 31, the effect of cps-k was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. as a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that cps-k promoted in vivo growth of s. enteritidis nub 1 and nub 31. in addition, cps-k enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus pneumoniae. the peak cps-k effect on infection with s. enteritidis  nub 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. the active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of cps-k was neutral cps-k, which is distinct from the o antigen and from acidic cps-k (the type-specific capsular antigen). preparations of neutral cps-k isolated from the  other three strains of k. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the kasuya strain. neutral cps-k, with identical antigenicity to that from the kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. no parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and  adjuvant activity of neutral cps-k.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring xanthines on bacteria. i. antimicrobial action and  potentiating effect on antibiotic spectra.
AB  == the effect of xanthines on various microorganisms was studied. the antibacterial  effect was not high; most of the test organisms could easily withstand a concentration of 2,500 mug/ml. caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. the effect was both bacteriostatic and  bactericidal against susceptible organisms. the susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. the morphology of aerobacter  aerogenes and a. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. this potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

TI  == cell wall replication in salmonella typhosa.
AB  == changes in the fluorescence of the cell wall of salmonella typhosa (ty2 w) were studied during growth after direct labeling with fluorescein conjugated homologous or "anti-o" globulins. fluorescence decreased evenly with culture growth and cell division, but the addition ofchloramphenicol resulted in large, nondividing cells that showed increasing interruption of fluorescence of the wall marker. the process thus differs from the equatorial origin and discrete hemispherical addition of new wall previously described in streptococcus pyogenes. these findings, in addition to demonstrating the formation of new wall  in the presence of chloramphenicol, appear consistent only with the concept that  wall replication in the salmonellas occurs by means of diffuse intercalation of new materials among old.

TI  == modification of host responses to bacterial endotoxins. i. specificity of pyrogenic tolerance and the role of hypersensitivity in pyrogenicity, lethality,  and skin reactivity.
AB  == evidence is presented suggesting that the apparent non-specificity of pyrogenic tolerance observed with gram-negative bacterial endotoxins is due to related antigenic determinants associated with the macromolecular toxins. this is based on results obtained in rabbits from pyrogenic cross-tolerance tests with selected endotoxins. in these tests, purified endotoxins from escherichia coli (coo8) and  chromobacterium violaceum (cv) gave results one might expect with non-reciprocal  cross-reacting antigens in classical immune systems. additional evidence for an immune mechanism in tolerance is suggested by the highly significant anamnestic response observed. lipid a, a toxic derivative of the purified coo8 endotoxin, failed to induce pyrogenic tolerance against the parent toxin. these results are  explained by assuming that endotoxins have two interdependent activities associated with different portions of the macromolecule; one is assumed to be responsible for the primary toxicity, and the other is involved in secondary toxicity. the latter is dependent on the hypersensitive state of the host. additional evidence for the role of hypersensitivity in secondary toxicity is based on the observation that adult rabbits are highly sensitive to the pyrogenic, lethal, and skin-reacting activities of endotoxin in contrast to young animals which are more resistant to all of these attributes of toxicity. in adults, the host responses to pyrogenicity, lethality, and skin reactivity could  be partially inhibited by the early exposure of the animals to massive doses of endotoxin equivalent to a ld(50). the pyrogenic tolerance shown in these animals  was specific indicating that the inhibition of the hypersusceptibility to endotoxin involved an immunological mechanism. a mechanism of endotoxin tolerance is proposed and discussed based on the induction of specific antibodies capable of assisting the res in the clearance and destruction of endotoxin. it is suggested that the present inconsistencies relative to the chemical nature and biological activities of endotoxins might be explained on the basis of these two  activities and the failure to recognize the importance of the immunological state of the host in which the toxins are tested.
