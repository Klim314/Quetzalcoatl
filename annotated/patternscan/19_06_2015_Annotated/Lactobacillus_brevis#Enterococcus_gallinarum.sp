TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriophage for carnobacterium divergens ncfb 2763 by host specificity and electron microscopy.
AB  == carnobacterium divergens ncfb 2763 was used to isolate bacteriophage cd1 from minced beef using an enrichment isolation technique. host specificity testing showed that it exhibited lytic activity only against a limited number of c. divergens strains. no activity was observed against any of the c. gallinarum, c.  mobile, c. piscicola, enterococcus durans, lactobacillus plantarum and lact. brevis strains tested. anaerobic incubation had no effect on the host specificity pattern. bacteriophage cd1 belongs to bradley group b and on average the head was 94 nm, the tail 103 x 23 nm and the base plate 48 x 32 nm.
