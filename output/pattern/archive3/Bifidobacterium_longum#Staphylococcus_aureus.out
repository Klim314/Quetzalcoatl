cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
aim: to investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. methods: the septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. the animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. the mixture of probiotics included bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. we observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. we also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. the severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. results: probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect was dose dependent. the survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. however, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, p < 0.05). the total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81 +/- 0.67, p < 0.05). the total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, p < 0.05). the population of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, p < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, p < 0.05). with probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, p < 0.01). conclusion: escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
in vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of bifidobacterium spp. in the first part of the study, the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of staphylococcus aureus. six strains, of sonicated bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of s. aureus s.p.-n2. in the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of bifidobacterium against propionibacterium acne kctc3320, using the co-culture method. the loss of p. acnes viability, caused by b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). in the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (no), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage raw 264.7 cell line. treatment of raw 264.7 cells, with bifidobacterium, decreased production of no and tnf-alpha rather than lps (100 ng/ml) treatment. the results suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 could be used as an effective control for p. acnes kctc3320, and s. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. we suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.
antagonistic action of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in relation to staphylococcus aureus and their influence on the immune response in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice.
the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus casei imv b-7280, lact. acidophilus imv b-7279, bifidobacterium longum vk1, and b. bifidum vk2 strains or their various compositions in relation to staphylococcus aureus in vitro and on models of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. it was found that under the influence of these strains and their various compositions, the in vitro growth of staph. aureus was inhibited, and the number of colonies of staph. aureus plated from the vagina of infected mice was significantly reduced. the antibacterial activity of these strains separately and in compositions correlated with their ability to improve the performance of the immune response. these strains were the most effective in the following compositions: lact. casei imv b-7280-b. longum vk1-b. bifidum vk2. strains of lact. casei imv b-7280, lact. acidophilus imv b-7279, b. bifidum vk2, and b. longum vk1 are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis and for immunity correction.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
[the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of bifidobacterium longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii.
the antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. at the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. in a single cultivation of bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. to increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of b. longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by b. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by p. freudenreichii, was done using tpy medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. by the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. the antimicrobial activities of the mixture against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus were 35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of b. longum alone. when the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of b. longum and p. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using tpy medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for m. luteus, pseudomonas sp. and s. aureus, respectively.
