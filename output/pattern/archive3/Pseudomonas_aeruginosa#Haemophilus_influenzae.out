[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibacterial agents (2007)].
from october 2007 to september 2008, we collected the specimen from 362 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 14 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 413 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 412 strains were examined. the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 65, streptococcus pneumoniae 90, haemophilus influenzae 88, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 53, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, klebsiella pneumoniae 19, and moraxella catarrhalis 41. of 65 s. aureus strains, those with 2 mug/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 mug/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 38 (58.5%) and 27 (41.5%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 mug/ml or less. against mrsa, vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 mug/ml. linezolid also showed the same activity as them. carbapenems and penems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 mug/ml or less. imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 and 1 mug/ml, respectively. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: over 128 mug/ml) for erythromycin (38.2%) and clindamycin (18.0%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its mic90 was 0.063 mug/ml or less. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its mic90 was 0.5 mug/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 2 mug/ml. against k. pneumoniae, cefozopran had the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 mug/ml or less. also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against m. catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 2 mug/ml or less. the approximately half the number (45.9%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.8% and 31.5% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (21.9%), s. pneumoniae (20.8%), and h. influenzae (18.6%). s. pneumoniae (27.1%), h. influenzae (24.0%) and p. aeruginosa (17.8%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (23.9%) and h. influenzae (23.6%). the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were s. pneumoniae, and their isolation frequencies were 34.8%.
in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.
global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. we report here on susceptibility among gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). most enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in north america, europe, and asia/pacific rim. amikacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in north america. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported for 11.0% of escherichia coli isolates and 24.2% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the middle east and >43% in africa and latin america, respectively. statistically significant (p<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except haemophilus influenzae. significant (p<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.
[nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2012].
the nationwide surveillance of antibacterial susceptibility to meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates during 2012 in japan was conducted. a total of 2985 strains including 955 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1782 strains of gram-negative bacteria, and 248 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 31 medical institutions were examined. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). 2. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous studies in 2009 or 2006. therefore, the tendency to increase in antimicrobial resistance rates was not observed. 3. mepm resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.8% (56/315 strains). compared to our previous results, it was the lowest than that in 2006 and 2009. 4. carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter species, which emerged in worldwide, were not observed. 5. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 6.2% (59/951 strains) in enterobacteriaceae, which increased compared with that of our previous studies in 2009 or before. whereas, the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5/315 strains) in p. aeruginosa, which was stable. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 17 years passed after available for commercial use in japan.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2006)].
from october 2006 to september 2007, we collected the specimen from 356 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 14 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 414 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 407 strains were examined. the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 64, streptococcus pneumoniae 96, haemophilus influenzae 87, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 52, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, klebsiella pneumoniae 20, and moraxella catarrhalis 44. of 64 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 27 (42.2%) and 37 (57.8%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. against mrsa, vancomycin and linezolid showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (45.8%) and clindamycin (20.8%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its mic90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its mic90 was 0.5 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 2 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against m. catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (50.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 49.2% and 28.1% of all the respiratory infections, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. pneumoniae (29.2%), s. aureus (20.8%), and h. influenzae (12.9%). h. influenzae (25.0%) and p. aeruginosa (21.7%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the antibacterial agent administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (27.5%) and h. influenzae (22.5%). the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides was p. aeruginosa, and its isolation frequently was 39.4%.
[in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e. coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.
[antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2008. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.8% of escherichia coli, 2.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of proteus vulgaris. esbl produced strains were 6.8% at k. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at p. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. among haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an mic90 of 1 microg/ml and doripenem showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa have potent activity. of all p. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. against other glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
[chronic bronchial infection: the problem of pseudomonas aeruginosa].
pathogenic bronchopulmonary colonizations and the exacerbations produced are among the most important causes of reduced pulmonary function in patients with bronchiectasis. the most frequent pathogens in these patients are haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. lesions are produced by the local inflammatory process and the vicious circle developed by antigen stimulation, the release of inflammatory mediators, the presence of neutrophils, the increase of bacterial inoculum and the release of bacterial exoproducts. p. aeruginosa has been demonstrated to affect the patients with bronchiectasis and poorest quality of life and to colonize those with the poorest pulmonary function and the highest number of antimicrobial treatments. in bronchiectasis, as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) or cystic fibrosis, p. aeruginosa is able to colonize the respiratory mucosa chronically. due to the ecological niche occupied by p. aeruginosa and the multitude of cycles with antimicrobial agents to which these patients are subjected, the development of antimicrobial resistance is highly likely, encouraged by the high proportion of hypermutation variants in existence. likewise, p. aeruginosa naturally grows in the form of biofilms on the mucosal surface, greatly contributing to its persistence. antimicrobial treatment in patients with bronchiectasis and p. aeruginosa colonization should be based on antimicrobial agents, alone or in combination, that do not lose activity when acting on biofilms.
monitoring antibiotic resistance in ocular microorganisms: results from the antibiotic resistance monitoring in ocular microrganisms (armor) 2009 surveillance study.
purpose: to determine the antibacterial susceptibility profile of bacterial pathogens from ocular infections against relevant aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide, lincosamide, and macrolide antibacterial agents. design: laboratory investigation. methods: isolates from patients with bacterial eye infections were collected prospectively by 34 institutions across the united states and were submitted to a central laboratory for inclusion in the antibiotic resistance monitoring in ocular microrganisms (armor) study. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by microbroth dilution for 200 staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), 144 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 75 streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), 73 haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae), and 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) isolates. results: a large proportion of s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to oxacillin/methicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones; 46.5% of s. aureus, 58.3% of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.0% of p. aeruginosa, and 9.3% of pneumococcal isolates were nonsusceptible to 2 or more antibacterial drug classes. only 2.7% of h. influenzae isolates were nonsusceptible to 1 of the agents tested. methicillin-resistant staphylococci were statistically more likely (all p < .0038) also to be resistant to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. conclusions: resistance to 1 or more antibiotics is prevalent among ocular bacterial pathogens. current resistance trends should be considered before initiating empiric treatment of common eye infections.
[antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2006].
we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1280 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (19 genus or species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2006. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.7% of escherichia coli, 2.7% of klebsiella spp., and 11.4% of proteus spp. notably, 18.8% of proteus mirabilis was found to produce esbl higher than 16.7% in 2004. this result was higher extremely than other species. among haemophilus influenzae, only 1.2% produced beta-lactamase and 62.8% that increased compared with 57.7% in 2004, were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. although few antibacterial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa have potent activity, only three agents--doripenem, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin-showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml. of all p aeruginosa strains, 5.7% were resistant to six or more agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, a decrease compared to 8.7% in 2004. against other glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2004.
mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in infections of copd patients.
a key characteristic of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is the persistent presence of bacteria in the lower airways. the most commonly isolated bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of copd patients are nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae, with growing evidence of the significance of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in severe copd disease. this review focuses on the antibiotic resistant mechanisms associated with the gram-negative bacteria h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis and comparison with p. aeruginosa infection because of the recent evidence of its significance in patients with severe copd disease. these mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis are mostly associated with serine beta-lactamases of class a type, whereas p. aeruginosa strains exhibit a much broader repertoire with class a-d type mechanisms. other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include membrane permeability, efflux pump systems and mutations in antimicrobial targets. antimicrobial resistance within biofilm matrices appears to be different to the mechanisms observed when the bacteria are in the planktonic state. p. aeruginosa exhibits a more numerous and diverse range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in comparison to m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. the recognition that p. aeruginosa is associated with exacerbations in patients with more severe copd and that turnover in infecting strains is detected (unlike in cystic fibrosis patients), then further investigation is required to better understand the contribution of antimicrobial resistance and other virulence mechanisms to poor clinical outcomes to improve therapeutic approaches.
reliability of quantitative real-time pcr for bacterial detection in cystic fibrosis airway specimens.
the cystic fibrosis (cf) airway microbiome is complex; polymicrobial infections are common, and the presence of fastidious bacteria including anaerobes make culture-based diagnosis challenging. quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) offers a culture-independent method for bacterial quantification that may improve diagnosis of cf airway infections; however, the reliability of qpcr applied to cf airway specimens is unknown. we sought to determine the reliability of nine specific bacterial qpcr assays (total bacteria, three typical cf pathogens, and five anaerobes) applied to cf airway specimens. airway and salivary specimens from clinically stable pediatric cf subjects were collected. quantitative pcr assay repeatability was determined using triplicate reactions. split-sample measurements were performed to measure variability introduced by dna extraction. results from qpcr were compared to standard microbial culture for pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae, common pathogens in cf. we obtained 84 sputa, 47 oropharyngeal and 27 salivary specimens from 16 pediatric subjects with cf. quantitative pcr detected bacterial dna in over 97% of specimens. all qpcr assays were highly reproducible at quantities>/=10(2) rrna gene copies/reaction with coefficient of variation less than 20% for over 99% of samples. there was also excellent agreement between samples processed in duplicate. anaerobic bacteria were highly prevalent and were detected in mean quantities similar to that of typical cf pathogens. compared to a composite gold standard, qpcr and culture had variable sensitivities for detection of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and h. influenzae from cf airway samples. by reliably quantifying fastidious airway bacteria, qpcr may improve our understanding of polymicrobial cf lung infections, progression of lung disease and ultimately improve antimicrobial treatments.
adhesion of respiratory-infection-associated microorganisms on degradable thermoplastic composites.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate bacterial adhesion and early colonization on a composite consisting of bioactive glass (bag) particles and copolymer of epsilon-caprolactone/d,l-lactide. materials were incubated with suspensions of both type strains and clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa for 30 minutes (adhesion) and 4 hours (colonization). clear differences exist in the microorganisms' ability to adhere on the experimental materials. however, the presence of bag particles does not inhibit bacterial adhesion, but early colonization of the materials with p. aeruginosa was inhibited by the addition of 90-315 mum bag particles.

cystic fibrosis (cf), a condition produced by mutations in the gene that encodes  the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is the most prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease in caucasian populations. among other repercussions, this defect leads to an alteration of respiratory secretions and determines a predisposition for chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection, which is the main driver of the high morbidity and early mortality of cf patients. colonization by staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae is frequent in children younger than 10 years, but mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa is by far the most relevant pathogen in adults with cf and is responsible for the progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration. as a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia, achromobacter spp. and burkholderia cepacia complex, is also frequent in adult cf patients. the special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in cf make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2005)].
from october 2005 to september 2006, we collected the specimen from 366 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 411 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 406 strains were examined. the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 70, streptococcus pneumoniae 85, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 46, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, klebsiella pneumoniae 21, and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 40. of 70 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 38 (54.3%) and 32 (45.7%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of 37 strains (97.4%) at 0.063 microg/ml or less. against mrsa, arbekacin and vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (38.1%) and clindamycin (22.6%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its mic90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its mic90 was 0.5 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), arbekacin had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (53.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.3% and 29.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (15.4%), s. pneumoniae (23.4%), and h. influenzae (21.3%). s. aureus (25.4%) and s. pneumoniae (18.0%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.0%) and h. influenzae (21.4%). the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, and their isolation frequencies were each 35.3%.
the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy. part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from january to august 2006. with the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (rtis). antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 staphylococcus aureus, 200 streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 streptococcus pyogenes, 165 haemophilus influenzae, 91 moraxella catarrhalis, 74 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the central laboratory of the research center for anti-infective drugs of the kitasato institute, according to recommendations issued by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). the antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). three (2.1%) of the 143 p. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult rti to various antibacterial agents. these data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
identification of an inhibitor of the murc enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli, murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
[species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated raisus using an early-harvested cell suspension].
we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests. with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.
prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from sputa of patients with cystic fibrosis.
background: new emerging pathogens and associated antimicrobial resistance mechanisms have been observed in the respiratory tract of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (cf) in the last years. amongst others, the rate of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains is growing. however, there are no published data on the prevalence of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa in cf patients to our knowledge. methods: in this study, 271 sputum samples of 60 cf patients were collected during a 12-months period. microbiological cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the most frequently isolated bacteria were performed. results: 464 bacterial and 414 fungal strains were isolated and characterized. 63.3% of the patients harbored staphylococcus aureus, 50% p. aeruginosa, 16.6% haemophilus influenzae, 15% stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 13.3% non tuberculous mycobacteria (ntm). methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and mbl-producing p. aeruginosa were detected in 3 (5%) and 5 (8.3%) patients respectively. among the fungi, aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans showed the highest prevalence. conclusions: the detection of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa and mrsa in cf patients confirms that antimicrobial resistance patterns should be always kept under surveillance. moreover hygiene regulations in cf clinics should prevent a further spread of resistant bacterial strains.
antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinically isolated respiratory bacterial pathogens in japan between 2005 and 2006.
the current status of the susceptibility of the main respiratory bacterial pathogens was evaluated by analysing the antibacterial activity of 21 drugs, including four carbapenems, against five species of the pathogens isolated between january 2005 and january 2006. a total of 157 strains were studied. carbapenems inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains at concentrations that were below the breakpoints set by the japanese society of chemotherapy (2 and 1mug/ml for pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infection, respectively). however, the majority of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to carbapenems. meropenem, but not the other carbapenems, inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae isolates, including beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of <or=1 microg/ml. the mic(50) and mic(90) of meropenem, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, against pseudomonas aeruginosa were the lowest of the carbapenems. by comparing these results with our previous data, it was found that there was no increase in resistance to carbapenems in any of the species tested. thus, it can be stated that carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2004)].
from october 2004 to september 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 87, streptococcus pneumoniae 80, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, klebsiella pneumoniae 15, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. of 87 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. against mrsa, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the potent activity and its mic90 was 2 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: 128 microg/ml or more) for abk (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/ml. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (amk) had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 4 microg/ml. the activity of czop against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, czop, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (21.6%), s. pneumoniae (24.7%) and h. influenzae (20.1%). s. aureus (20.9%), s. pneumoniae (16.1%), and h. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.3%) and h. influenzae (25.1%). the bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were p. aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.
respiratory tract infections: at-risk patients, who are they? implications for their management with levofloxacin.
two of the most serious respiratory tract infections are community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb). the most common pathogens found in patients with these infections are haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. pseudomonas aeruginosa is also relatively common, particularly in elderly patients with aecb. s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa are also of concern in relation to the development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. the administration of antibiotics at doses that result in concentrations exceeding the mutant prevention concentration at the site of infection is one strategy to prevent the development of drug-resistant pathogens. aecb is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients treated in the intensive care unit. cap is also associated with significant risks and often requires treatment under hospital supervision. several patient-related factors help identify those patients who are most at risk of mortality and morbidity. treatment should be tailored towards the severity of the disease. the fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are an effective treatment option for aecb and cap. compared with many other antibiotics, resistance to levofloxacin remains low for most infecting pathogens. the oral bioavailability of levofloxacin is over 99%, enabling simple switching from intravenous to oral therapy during treatment. it is also preferentially distributed to compartments in the lung, thus achieving high concentrations at the site of respiratory tract infections. combined with cover of the major infecting pathogens found in patients with aecb and cap, and a cost-effective treatment compared with many alternative therapies, levofloxacin is an attractive option for the treatment of at-risk patients with these respiratory tract infections.
[the analysis of the isolated microorganisms from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients treated in children's memorial health institute 1999-2002].
the aim of the study was, to analyze the microorganisms cultured from materials from the airways of children with cystic fibrosis treated in the children's memorial health institute in warsaw during 1999-2002. a total of 411 samples were tested, obtained from the airways of 58 patients with diagnosed mucoviscidosis. the age of the treated patients was within the range of 1 month and 20 years. the bacteriological tests were taken during routine visits in the consultation and pulmonology clinic, which took place 3-4 times a year. the most often isolated strain was staphylococcus aureus--48%. 17% of the isolates of haemophilus influenzae and 13% of pseudomonas aeruginosa were obtained. most s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and h. infiuenzae isolates showed high susceptibility to tested antimicrobial agents. about 6% of all s. aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). s. aureus was occurring in all age groups with the same frequency. the rods h. influenzae were cultured more often from children under 10 years, while p. aeruginosa more often from older patients.
antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being 0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2 position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.
non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents decrease bacterial colonisation of contact lenses and prevent adhesion to human corneal epithelial cells.
purpose: to investigate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (nsaids), salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac for inhibition of bacterial colonization of contact lenses (cl) and human corneal epithelial cells (hce). methods: cls pre-colonised with pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed overnight to nsaids and the number of viable bacteria on the cls were calculated. cytotoxicity of nsaids to hce cells was evaluated with the mtt assay. viable counts were used to measure the adhesion of p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis to hce cells in the presence of the least cytotoxic nsaid. results: all nsaids significantly decreased bacterial colonization of cls in a dose-dependent manner. salicylic acid (100 mm) completely inhibited colonisation of all species tested and was the least cytotoxic. salicylic acid also prevented adhesion of p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis to hce (60% and 58% inhibition at 60 mm at 2 hours). conclusions: salicylic acid demonstrated potential as a compound for incorporation into anti-bacterial strategies to prevent bacterial contamination of contact lenses. this study highlighted the potential for nsaids as anti-bacterial agents and indicates that this class of compound should be investigated for other suitable candidates.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2002)].
from october 2002 to september 2003, we collected the specimen from 476 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 584 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 578 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 77, streptococcus pneumoniae 103, haemophilus influenzae 95, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, klebsiella pneumoniae 36, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. of 77 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (mpipc) [methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) was 43 strains (55.8%). against mssa, imipenem (ipm) and minocycline (mino) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. although clindamycin (cldm) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. cefotiam (ctm) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. against mrsa, vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (ccl), erythromycin (em), cldm, and tetracycline (tc) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. against h. influenzae, lvfx showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was good and its mic90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. czop and cefpirome (cpr) were the most potent against k. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of mic90. also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. pneumoniae (22.6%). in contrast, s. aureus (16.6%) and p. aeruginosa (13.7%) were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were h. influenzae (24.5%) and s. pneumoniae (24.2%). in comparison of the isolated bacteria by pretreatment agents, p. aeruginosa was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with cephems or macrolides and h. influenzae was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with penicillins.
[antimicrobial susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in major hospitals in nagano prefecture].
we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of various antimicrobial agents against 140 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 131 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 178 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from respiratory organs in 28 affiliated hospitals in nagano prefecture between december 2002 and february 2003. the results of this report were as followed: 1. all 140 strains of s. pneumoniae were classified into 3 groups; penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp) (47.1%), penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) (43.6%) and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) (9.3%). 2. carbapenems and glycopeptide (vancomycin) had highly potent antimicrobial activity against pisp and prsp like pssp. however, some of pisp or prsp isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). 3. all 131 strains ofh. influenzae were also classified into three groups; ampicillin sensitive h. influenzae (73.3%), beta-lactamase producing ampicillin resistant h. influenzae (blpar) (8.4%) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant h. influenzae (blnar) (18.3%). 4. carbapenems and a fluoroquinolone had highly potent antimicrobial activity against blpar and blnar. however, there were clear differences among 4 carbapenems for the antimicrobial activity. ceftriaxone (ctrx) was the most active among cepharosporins in this study. 5. the rate of p. aeruginosa isolates resistant to carbapenems, a fluoroquinolone and aminoglycosides were about 11 to approximately 16%, 15% and 0.6 to approximately 8%, respectively. none of the strains was resistant to all 3 antimicrobial classes, but 3 strains were resistant to combination of 2 classes. 6. the mic50 and mic90 values of various antibiotics against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa were different in all 4 regions. in conclusion, the antimicrobial surveillance programs are important for guiding empiric therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in regions and hospitals.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
from october 2001 to september 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 69, streptococcus pneumoniae 72, haemophilus influenzae 85, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, klebsiella pneumoniae 32, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 32, and others. of 69 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 43.5%. vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 2000. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 59.7% and both rates of pisp and prsp were the highest after 1992. carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity against h. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. against p. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the mic90s were 4 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (19.3%) and s. pneumoniae (19.9%). in contrast, h. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (20.8%) and h. influenzae (21.5%). s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while s. aureus increased. the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. the bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. from the patients who had already treated with macrolides, s. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while s. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.
[activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in japan].
a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%. however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis, the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.
contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the united states.
grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. a total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae (mic(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (mic(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. none of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same mic(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae. grepafloxacin was very active against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and legionella spp. (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). these results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
[surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
objective: to determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (hai) or community acquired infections (cai) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in china. methods: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. according to the criteria of guidelines of nccls (2001), mic(50) and mic(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and r%, i%, and s%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. results: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both cai and hai patients. the resistance rates of isolates, especially enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp. and acinetobacter spp. from hai were higher than those of cai. the carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against enterobacteriaceae. cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of gram-negative bacilli. most of the gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae had decreased. conclusion: (1) the results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some gram-negative pathogens. (2) the resistance rates of isolates from hai patients were higher than those of cai.
comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.
lactoperoxidase and human airway host defense.
the lactoperoxidase (lpo) antibiotic system is a well-characterized component of  mammary and salivary gland secretions. because lpo has been shown to function in ovine airways, human airway tissue and secretions were examined for the presence of lpo and its substrate, the anion thiocyanate (scn-). in addition, human airway secretions were tested for lpo-mediated antibacterial activity, and lpo's activity was assessed against some human airway pathogens. the data showed that normal human airway secretions contained lpo enzyme activity (0.65 +/- 0.09 microg/mg secreted protein; n = 17), and western blots of secretions demonstrated bands of the expected sizes for lpo. lpo mrna was detected in trachea by sequencing pcr-amplified cdna. scn-, lpo's substrate, was present in undiluted airway secretions at concentrations sufficient for lpo catalysis (0.46 +/- 0.19 mm; n = 8), and diluted secretions contained antibacterial activity with lpo-like properties. immunocytochemistry localized lpo to submucosal glands in human bronchi. finally, as expected based on the known antibacterial spectrum of the lpo system, airway secretions showed lpo-dependent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the airway lpo system was shown to be effective against burkholderia cepacia and haemophilus influenzae. thus, a functional lpo system exists in human airways and may contribute to airway host defense against infection.
cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
[in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (pzfx mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) the mic50 and mic90 values of pzfx against clinically isolated gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. pzfx showed broad spectrum activity. the antibacterial activities of pzfx against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (ipm/cs)-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (caz), ceftriaxone, ipm/cs, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) pzfx showed superior bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa to those of caz and ipm/cs after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) caz and ipm/cs had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of mic against p. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while pzfx exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) pzfx inhibited both dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from s. aureus at nearly the same level. pzfx showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase ii from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) pzfx mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of caz with following infection model caused by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, cmc pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) intravenous administration of pzfx with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
[evaluation of the rapid lumi 'eiken' using chemiluminescent assay for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing].
one hundred ninety eight clinical isolates, including enterobacteriaceae (70 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 strains), acinetobacter baumannii (10 strains), staphylococci (50 strains), enterococci (20 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains) and haemophilus influenzae (13 strains) were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities by using the rapid lumi 'eiken' (rl). as a reference method, broth microdilution method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used. then, each mic obtained by both of these methods was compared. in order to improve the discrepancy between mics obtained by both methods, modification of the rl method was studied. all mics using the rl method were obtained with an incubation period of 4 hours. the essential agreement (to within one twofold dilution) between mics obtained by both methods was 82%. the false susceptible in the rl method test results (very major error) and the false resistant in the rl tests (major error) were 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively. the agreement of interpretive category (that is, when the categories obtained by both methods are in perfect agreement) was 89%. proteus spp. and a. baumannii showed low essential agreements, 59% and 46% respectively. the differences were resulted from the rl method's mics being higher than the reference method. in order to improve the difference between both methods, the rl method's procedure was modified in the inoculum size (10(6) cfu/ml to 10(5) cfu/ml), the menadione concentration (5 mg/l to 25 mg/l) and the interpretive criteria for enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. as the results of the modification, the essential agreement in proteus spp. and a. baumannii increased to 82% and 81%, respectively, and there was no significant change in the other species of enterobacteriaceae. in the case of the modified rl method to enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii, the essential agreement, the very major error, the major error and the agreement of interpretive category of all 198 strains were 87%, 1.4%, 1.5% and 90%, respectively. in conclusion, with only 4-hour incubation period, the rl method based on chemiluminescent assay gave reliable susceptibility testing among the most clinically important bacteria. although several tests showed low essential agreement, it was possible to improve by use of the modified rl method. the rapid lumi 'eiken' will provide useful information for choosing the most effective antibiotic for primary treatment to bacterial infections.
in vitro susceptibility of new generation of antibacterial antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria.
antibiotic susceptibility of ten bacteria i.e. neisseria catarrhalis, salmonella  typhi, s. enteritidis, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas fluorescence, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and e. coli to twenty antibiotics i.e. cefpirom (30 mcg), ceftriaxone (30 mcg), erythromycin (15 mcg), doxycycline (30 mcg) lomefloxacin (10 mcg), sisomicin (30 mcg), vancomycin (30 mcg), augmentin (30 mcg), ampicillin (30 mcg), cotrimoxazole (25 mcg), cefotaxime (30 mcg), chloramphenicol (30 mcg), cephalexin (30 mcg), tetracycline (30 mcg), ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), nitrofurantoin (300 mcg), nalidixic acid (30 mcg), pefloxacin (10 mcg), norfloxacin and ofloxacin (5 mcg) was studied to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of recently introduced second and third generation antibiotics. all the test strains were sensitive to pefloxacin, erythromycin, augmentin and chloramphenicol. maximum resistance to cefpirom excluding e. coli and s. typhi and co-trimoxazole except s. typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed, occasional resistance was seen against ceftriaxone, vancomycin and cefotaxime.
in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
cefditoren pivoxil.
cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
from october 1999 to september 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 101, haemophilus influenzae 104, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 41, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. of 78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 57.7%. vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa without detection of abk-resistant strain (mic: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of vcm-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998. the frequency of prsp was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. carbapenems showed strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs showed strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. mics of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all h. influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. number of isolated p. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. the drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. on the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. the percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in the last year. as for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. they were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients, respectively. in 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. it was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. we examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. in patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. however, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased to 2/3 of the total in 1999. on the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were h. influenzae in 28.4%, s. pneumoniae in 25.7%, m. (b.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and s. aureus in 10.6%. the frequency of s. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. however, that of h. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many h. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.
[antibacterial activities of piperacillin for several resistant strains from respiratory infections--in reference to mrsa, prsp, blnar and p. aeruginosa].
we investigated antibacterial activities of piperacillin (pipc) for several resistant strains of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections from 1998 to 1999 in comparison with reference drugs and obtained the following results: 1. the majority of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) showed high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics including pipc. 2. mic90 of pipc was 1 and 4 micrograms/ml for penicillin intermediate and penicillin resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp/prsp), respectively. 3. mic90 of pipc was 0.25 microgram/ml for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae (blnar), showing higher antibacterial activity than the reference drugs. 4. pipc exhibited the mics of 8 micrograms/ml or less in 19 out of 40 ipm resistant (mic > or = 16 micrograms/ml) strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. from these results, pipc is proved to possess extremely favorable antibacterial activities for blnar, and it was suggested that pipc might be a drug of choice even for pisp/prsp and ipm resistant strains of p. aeruginosa.
[results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in hiroshima city to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. hiroshima levofloxacin susceptibility surveillance group].
to evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. among gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. to reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
[antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. ii antibiotic strategy].
antibiotherapy is one of the main treatments of cystic fibrosis, contributing to  a better nutritional and respiratory status and a prolonged survival. the choice of antibiotics depends on quantitative and qualitative analysis of sputum, bacteria resistance phenotypes and severity of infection. haemophilus influenzae infection can be treated orally with the association of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or a cephalosporin. staphylococcus aureus generally remains sensitive to usual antibiotics; in case of a methicillin-resistant strain, an oral bitherapy or a parenteral cure can be proposed. treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa is different in case of first colonization or chronic infection: in first colonization, parenteral antibiotherapy (beta-lactams-aminoglycosids) followed by inhaled antibiotherapy may eradicate the bacteria; in chronic infections, exacerbations require parenteral bi-antibiotherapy (beta-lactams or quinolons and aminoglycosids) for 15 to 21 days, inhaled antibiotics between the cures being useful to decrease the number of exacerbation. a careful monitoring of antibiotherapy is necessary because of possible induction of bacterial resistance, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminosids and allergy to beta-lactams.
in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.
the in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
the in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being serratia spp. (mic(90) 1 mg/l) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/l. gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis being inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were highly susceptible (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) but mrsa less susceptible (mic(90) 8 mg/l) to gemifloxacin. enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. gemifloxacin showed good activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and anaerobic cocci. a tentative in-vitro breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. the false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered acceptable. in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.
surfactant protein d stimulates phagocytosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa by alveolar macrophages.
surfactant protein (sp)-d is an oligomeric glycoprotein belonging to the family of collagen-like lectins known as collectins, which have previously been shown to stimulate phagocytosis and other immune cell functions. the hypothesis investigated in this study was that sp-d would stimulate the phagocytosis of an important pulmonary pathogen, pseudomonas aeruginosa. sp-d, isolated from the lavage fluid of silica-treated rats, significantly enhanced the uptake of three of six strains of p. aeruginosa by rat alveolar macrophages as analyzed by both fluorescence and electron microscopy. sp-d had only minimal effects on phagocytosis of haemophilus influenzae. sp-d bound to live p. aeruginosa, and binding was inhibited by chelation of calcium and by a competing saccharide, inositol. in vitro killing assays demonstrated that macrophage-mediated killing of one of the mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa was modestly enhanced by sp-d. p. aeruginosa was not measurably aggregated by sp-d either macroscopically or microscopically. further, sp-d does not appear to act as an activation ligand because adherence of macrophages to sp-d- coated slides did not stimulate the uptake of p. aeruginosa. these findings suggest that sp-d may be important in controlling the pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa in the lung.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 17 institutions around the entire japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1997 to september in 1998. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 55.0%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml against s. pneumoniae. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp)+pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. against h. influenzae and m.(b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. but the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. meropenem (mepm), ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). and tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were more active against k. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. the tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. the increase of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 24.5%, h. influenzae 21.4%, s. aureus 18.4% and p. aeruginosa 12.2%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. from patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. s. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
[a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
[antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
activities of new fluoroquinolones against fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens of the lower respiratory tract.
the activities of six new fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin, and levofloxacin) compared with those of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin with or without reserpine (20 microg/ml) were determined for 19 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 5 haemophilus sp. isolates, and 10 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin from patients with clinically confirmed lower respiratory tract infections. based upon the mics at which 50% of isolates were inhibited (mic50s) and mic90s, the most active agent was clinafloxacin, followed by (in order of decreasing activity) trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and grepafloxacin. except for clinafloxacin (and gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin for h. influenzae), none of the new agents had improved activities compared with that of ciprofloxacin for p. aeruginosa and h. influenzae. a variable reserpine effect was observed for ciprofloxacin and s. pneumoniae; however, for 9 of 19 (47%) isolates the mic of ciprofloxacin was decreased by at least fourfold, suggesting the presence of an efflux pump contributing to the resistance phenotype. the laboratory parc (ser79) mutant strain of s. pneumoniae required eightfold more ciprofloxacin for inhibition than the wild-type strain, but there was no change in the mic of sparfloxacin and only a 1-dilution increase in the mics of the other agents. for efflux pump mutant s. pneumoniae the activities of all the newer agents, except for levofloxacin, were reduced. except for clinafloxacin, all second-step laboratory mutants required at least 2 microg of all fluoroquinolones per ml for inhibition.
procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial sepsis in patients infected with hiv-1.
procalcitonin (proct) is a recently described marker of severe sepsis. it was decided to assess the value of proct as a marker of secondary infection in patients infected with hiv-1. proct plasma levels were measured by immunoluminometric assay in a prospective study in 155 hiv-infected individuals: 102 asymptomatic and 53 with lever or suspected secondary infections. the baseline plasma level of proct was low (0.5 ng/ml +/- 0.37), even in the latest stages of the disease, and did not differ from the values of healthy subjects (0.54 ng/ml +/- 0.08). edta-treated whole blood was collected from patients before starting specific antimicrobial therapy. no elevation of proct level was detected in hiv-infected patients with evolving secondary infections including pcp (n = 4), cerebral toxoplasmosis (n = 4), viral infections (n = 9), mycobacterial infections (n = 5), localized bacterial (n = 12) and fungal infections (n = 4), malignancies (n = 3), and in various associated infectious and non-infectious febrile events (n = 13). all these plasma values were lower than 2.1 ng/ml. in contrast, high proct plasma levels were detected in one hiv-infected patient with a septicaemic haemophilus influenzae infection (16.5 ng/ml) and another one with a septicaemic pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (44.1 ng/ ml), proct values decreased rapidly under appropriate therapy. proct seems to be a specific marker of bacterial sepsis in hiv-infected patients, as no increase in other secondary infections could be detected in those patients. a rapid determination of proct level could be useful to confirm or refute bacterial sepsis for a better management of febrile hiv-infected patients.
the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of er-35786, a new antipseudomonal  carbapenem.
er-35786 is a new parenteral 1 beta-methyl carbapenem with a broad antibacterial  spectrum and a potent antipseudomonal activity. it showed high in vitro activity, comparable to those of meropenem and a new carbapenem, bo-2727, against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, with mics at which 90% of strains tested are inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, er-35786 was the most active among the compounds tested, yet its mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae, er-35786 inhibited 90% of strains tested at a concentration of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. the mic90 of er-35786 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 3.13 micrograms/ml, and the compound was more active than meropenem. in addition, the activity of er-35786 against imipenem-, meropenem-, cefclidin-, or ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa was equal to or higher than that of the most active reference compound. the in vivo activity of er-35786 was consistent with this in vitro activity. the in vivo activity of er-35786 was highest for systemic infection models with methicillin-resistant s. aureus and beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa strains. in acute pneumonia caused by p. aeruginosa, er-35786 produced a greater reduction in the viable cell count in the lungs than did imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem.
antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime in vitro.
cefpodoxime proxetil is a new orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third-generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, and which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method, we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and quinolones against 637 recent clinical isolates from kaohsiung veterans general hospital in taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefpodoxime showed excellent activity, inhibiting over 90% of these isolates at 1 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparative drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefpodoxime showed moderate activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas it was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. however, all cephalosporins have shown little in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus regardless of in vitro results. cefpodoxime was inactive against enterococcus spp. against other streptococci, its activity was similar to other oral cephalosporins and quinolones tested. the results of this in vitro study indicated that oral administration of cefpodoxime should be an ideal agent in the empirical outpatient treatment for community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

(b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1992)].
bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan since 1981, and ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and characteristics of the patients and so forth each year. we discuss the results in detail. in 20 institutions around the entire japan from october 1992 to september 1993, 690 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 549 patients with lower respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological bacteria. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 101 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 121 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 32 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 28 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. s. aureus s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 61.4% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was higher than the previous year's 58.3%. mics values indicated that arbekacin was as active as vancomycin against all the strains on s. aureus. 2. s. pneumoniae benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. cefuzonam, cefazolin, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and mic80 was 0.015 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae all the drugs tested were potent against h. influenzae. ampicillin among the penicillins showed mic80 1 microgram/ml against h. influenzae. cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime showed the most potent activities, and mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid) ciprofloxacin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), and mic80 was 1 microgram/ml. cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam and tobramycin showed the next most potent activities with an mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with an mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. norfloxacin also showed some activity, and mic80 was 4 micrograms/ml. comparing to activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. k. pneumoniae the activities of all drugs except penicillins were high activities against k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity with an mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed by flomoxef, cefixime and cefozopran with their mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. 7. m.(b.) catarrhalis imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity against m.(b.) catarrhalis with an mic80 0.063 microgram/ml. minocycline and ofloxacin showed mic80s 0.125 microgram/ml, respectively. we also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological bacteria. as for patients backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found among patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 60.8% of the diseases. the distribution by lower respiratory tract infections was as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 30.4%, 29.5%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 12.2%. as for frequencies of etiologic bacteria for respiratory tract infections, h. influenzae: 22.2%, and s. pneumoniae: 15.1% in chronic bronchitis; s. pneumoniae: 2
a multicenter comparative study of the in vitro activity of fleroxacin and other  antimicrobial agents.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin was determined by broth microdilution against 2,079 recent bacterial isolates and compared to the activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx), and, as appropriate, erythromycin and oxacillin. most enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by the quinolones at a concentration of < or = 1 microgram/ml; mic90s of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin were 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. fleroxacin was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens. aside from the quinolones, ceftriaxone and tmp-smx were the most active antibiotics against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic90s of 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. ciprofloxacin was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other quinolones, while fleroxacin was more active against stenotrophomonas maltophilia: 17.7, 11.2, 20.0, and 22.4% of p. aeruginosa were resistant to fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were uniformally susceptible to all antibiotics tested, as were the majority of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. the mic90s of the quinolones and of the beta-lactam antibiotics for oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were 8- to 256-fold higher than for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. the beta-lactam antibiotics, tmp-smx, and erythromycin were more active than the quinolones against streptococci; all antibiotics were poorly active against enterococci. fleroxacin is active against a broad range of gram-negative bacilli and against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and should prove useful for such infections. however, its use cannot be recommended for infections due to oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, or enterococci.
antibacterial activity of cefprozil in vitro.
cefprozil is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against 637 recent clinical isolates from the kaohsiung veterans general hospital, taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefprozil showed good activity, inhibiting over 80% of these isolates at 8 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefprozil showed high activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, its activity was higher than that of other oral cephalosporins tested and was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. of enterococci tested, 57.7% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefprozil. against beta-hemolytic streptococci, its activity was superior to all other drugs tested. the results of this in vitro study indicate that oral administration of cefprozil might be efficacious in the treatment of community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1991)].
isolated bacteria from respiratory tract infections were collected since 1981 in  cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, and have been investigated for their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and reported by ikemoto, et al. relationships between these isolates and backgrounds of the patients were also studied each year. these results are discussed in detail in this report. in 20 institutions around the entire japan from october 1991 to september 1992, 631 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 529 patients with respiratory tract infections and tentatively determined to be etiological agents. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 96 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 112 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 111 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 114 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 41 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 39 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), klebsiella pneumoniae and some others, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were determined except for the strains that had been killed during transportation: 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 58.3% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased over previous year's 42.5%. as shown by the mics, arbekacin was active as vancomycin against all the strains on s. aureus. 2. s. pneumoniae: benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed a potent activity against s. pneumoniae. cefuzonam, cefmenoxime, cefozopran and cefotaxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem; a penem antibiotic, showed the most potent activity with mic80 of 0.03 micrograms/ml. 3. h. influenzae: activities of all drugs were excellent against h. influenzae strains tested. ampicillin showed mic80 of 1 micrograms/ml against h. influenzae. cefuzonam showed the most potent activity among cephems, it completely killed all bacteria at mic 0.06 micrograms/ml. cefotaxime and cefmenoxime showed next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.06 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid). ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), and their mic80s were 4 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid): similarly, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. k. pneumoniae: the activities of all drugs except for penicillins were very high against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
antimicrobial activity of sm-17466, a novel carbapenem antibiotic with potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-17466, a new 1 beta-methyl carbapenem, were evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isoaltes and compared with the activities of meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin. sm-17466 had a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive bacteria, showing especially potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. the mics of sm-17466, meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin at which 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were inhibited were 3.13, 50, 100, 1.56, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. this activity of sm-17466 was almost equivalent to those of the antibiotics used for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. sm-17466 also showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. in contrast, sm-17466 was less active against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with the other carbapenems; however, of the carbapenems, sm-17466 exhibited the highest activity against haemophilus influenzae and bacteriodes fragilis. sm-17466, at a 50% inhibitory concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml, bound to penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 4 in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and also had good binding to penicillin-binding protein 2' in a methicillin-resistant strain (50% inhibitory concentration, 5.9 micrograms/ml). this high affinity, which was 10 and 20 times greater than those for meropenem and imipenem, respectively, was reflected in the potent activity of sm-17466 against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. sm-17466 demonstrated excellent in vivo efficacy against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus strains in a mouse peritoneal infection model: the efficacy of sm-17466 against methicillin-resistant strains was equal to or one-third that of vancomycin. this activity was comparable to the in vitro activity of sm-17466. the subcutaneous injection of sm-17466 in mice revealed that the half-life of sm-17466 in serum was about 18 min, intermediate between those of vancomycin and arbekacin and 1.5-fold that of imipenem-cilastatin. sm-17466 was resistant to hydrolysis by swine renal dehydropeptidase i, to an extent comparable to the resistance shown by meropenem.
antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in japan.
bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pnuemoniae and s. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. new quinolones and new generation cephems were active against h. influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. only one strain of s. aureus was methicillin-resistant. as regards other pathogens, 6.5% of s. pneumoniae and 14.9% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. mrsa was found infrequently. but ampicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
comparative in vitro activity of apalcillin alone and combined with ro 48-1220, a novel penam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
objective: the in vitro activity of apalcillin plus ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. methods: agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (mbc) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the nccls m26-t method. results: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except klebsiella oxytoca (mic90 32 microg/ml). among the enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (4 microg/ml fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing mic90 results. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics less-than-or-equal 1 microg/ml). however, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of ro 48-1220 alone (mics less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). all pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia and acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (mic90 0.25 to 4 microg/ml). for the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, corynebacterium jeikeium and enterococcus species other than e. faecalis. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum tem enzymes, but less active against isolates producing shv-type beta-lactamases. when tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/ml). conclusions: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.
prediction of piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility among enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other bacteria using ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial in vitro test results.
the ability of various in vitro beta-lactam susceptibility test results to predict the susceptibility of piperacillin-tazobactam (a new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) was assessed using more than 46,000 recent clinical isolates. the organisms were tested by reference-quality national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) broth microdilution procedures and interpreted by the currently published nccls criteria. the recommended antimicrobial tests that would accurately predict the piperacillin-tazobactam in vitro efficacy had an overall very major, false-susceptible rate of only 0.6% (< or = 1.5% is acceptable). the following drug tests can be used to judge piperacillin-tazobactam activity and spectrum (low patient risk) conservatively: for enterobacteriaceae use ticarcillin-clavulanic acid results (0.6% very major error); for pseudomonas aeruginosa use piperacillin (0.1%) results; for enterococci use ampicillin or ampicillin-sulbactam (1.8%) results; for haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis use cefotaxime or cefuroxime or ceftriaxone (1.5%); and for staphylococci use oxacillin by nccls recommendations. when the piperacillin-tazobactam testing reagents become available, the direct testing of this combination should be applied to relevant clinical isolates. the piperacillin-tazobactam break points should be reassessed as indicated by the cited minimum inhibitory concentration population analysis to improve predictive accuracy; h. influenzae susceptibility modified to < or = 2/4 micrograms/ml and enterococcus species susceptibility tested at < or = 16/4 micrograms.
evaluation of opc-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.
cefquinome (hr 111v). in vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
cefquinome (formerly hr 111v), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest mic (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii strains. a total of 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome activity of particular note for gram-positive isolates included corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (mic50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than oxacillin-susceptible (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus species (mic90, < or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). when tested against organisms possessing bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (mic, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. this compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.
minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various national committee for clinical laboratory standards susceptibility test methods. quality control study group.
several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (qc) giudelines. replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended qc strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. in addition qc mic ranges, using appropriate medium modification for haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226 were reported on four (du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and fk-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
inhibition of fungal growth by pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas cepacia isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
this study was undertaken because of the infrequency of infections due to candida species in patients with cystic fibrosis despite their extensive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. in vitro susceptibility studies revealed significant inhibition of 11 strains of fungi known to infect human beings by 10 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and nine strains of pseudomonas cepacia isolated from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis. the fungi were candida krusei, candida keyfr, candida guillermondii, candida tropicalis, candida lusitaniae, candida parapsilosis, candida pseudotropicalis, candida albicans, torulopsis glabrata, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus fumigatus. inhibition of fungal growth by escherichia coli (nctc 10418), staphylococcus aureus (nctc 6571) and haemophilus influenzae (nctc 11931) could not be demonstrated. the continued presence in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis of strains of p. aeruginosa and p. cepacia, which produce antifungal substances, may inhibit growth of candida species and so prevent overt candida infections. a. fumigatus would seem to be the most important fungus causing disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. it is therefore interesting to note that this was the most resistant of all the fungi tested for inhibition by p. aeruginosa and p. cepacia.
comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro activities of bay y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
bay y3118 was highly active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). for enterococcus faecalis and corynebacterium jeikeium, mic90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. bay y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
[the bactericidal effect of oxybuprocaine. a possible cause of false negative results in bronchoalveolar lavage].
new approaches in the diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in intensive care units, are quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid or the protected specimen brush. the sensitivity of these methods, however, has often been found to be as low as 50-60%. one possible explanation for the low sensitivity of these diagnostic tools is the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used in bronchoscopy. therefore, we investigated the bactericidal properties of oxybuprocaine, a topical anaesthetic used for bronchoscopy in our clinic, in order to test the reliability of specimens obtained from bal. methods. the bactericidal activity of oxybuprocaine in concentrations of 1%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.01% was tested by constructing time-kill curves for streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. five stains of each bacterial species were tested. the inoculum size was 10(4) ml, and bacteria were counted after 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min. results. the resulting time-kill curves are demonstrated in figs. 1-4. the most sensitive bacteria were s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, in which significant bactericidal activity could be shown even with a 0.01% solution of oxybuprocaine. e. coli and p. aeruginosa were also inhibited, but only at the highest concentration of 1%. conclusions. the use of local anaesthetics before material is taken for culture, e.g. from bal, may give rise to false-negative results and should therefore be avoided or reduced. for each local anaesthetic used in bronchoscopy, the concentrations that can be used without the risk of false-negative results should be determined.
the north american component (the united states and canada) of an international comparative mic trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
common lots of reference mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in february-april 1992. five medical centers in the united states and canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). quality-control strains were processed concurrently, mics recorded, and data processed at a common location. selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and p. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
penicillins. a current review of their clinical pharmacology and therapeutic use.
the penicillins are a large group of bicyclic ring compounds which contain a 4-membered beta-lactam ring (penams) fused to a 5-membered thiazolidine ring. benzylpenicillin (penicillin g) was the first natural penicillin with potent activity against all gram-positive pathogens, gram-negative cocci and some spirochaetes and actinomycetes. for the last 50 years benzylpenicillin has been the mainstay of therapy for serious pneumococcal, streptococcal, meningococcal and gonococcal infections. however, the past decade has seen the emergence of resistance in certain parts of the world, initially among the gonococci, and more recently among the pneumococci and meningococci. discovery of the 6-aminopenicillinamic acid nucleus has led to considerable manipulation of the basic ring structure, resulting initially in the synthesis of ampicillin, and subsequently the other aminopenicillins, analogues, esters and prodrugs. these drugs have the advantages of improved oral bioavailability and superior activity against haemophilus influenzae, certain gram-negative bacilli, salmonellae, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes, making these agents popular in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. the increasing spread of bacterial resistance, particularly among enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae, has curtailed the usefulness of these drugs in these clinical settings. to counteract this problem, a number of agents combining a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g. clavulanic acid, tazobactam and sulbactam) have been developed. these inhibitors have no intrinsic antibacterial activity, but combining them with a penicillin (e.g. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) confers greater stability to beta-lactamases and hence a broader spectrum of activity. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococci that rendered benzylpenicillin ineffective also stimulated the search for penicillinase-resistant penicillins--methicillin and nafcillin, followed by the acid-stable isoxazolyl penicillins. these agents are now the principle antistaphylococcal treatment. methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci are currently a major cause of hospital sepsis, and are resistant to these latter agents. enteric gram-negative bacilli have been the predominant cause of serious hospital infections during the last 30 years. further manipulation of the penicillin structure has resulted in compounds with broader activity against gram-negative bacilli, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa, while retaining activity against gram-positive pathogens. the carboxypenicillins were the first step in this direction, but have been largely superseded by the ureidopenicillins. these agents have better activity against p. aeruginosa, and are still effective against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci and anaerobic organisms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
changes in adherence of respiratory pathogens to hep-2 cells induced by subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim.
preincubation with subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim decreased the adherence of the respiratory pathogens klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis to human larynx carcinoma hep-2 cells. subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin did not change the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa or streptococcus pneumoniae 15.62, but adhesion of s. pneumoniae 15.42 was significantly enhanced by subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations.
in vitro activity of l-627, a new carbapenem.
the in vitro activity of l-627, a new parenterally administered carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, fce 22101 (a penem), ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. l-627 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90] ranging from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml). l-627 displayed activity equal to that of meropenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), although, as with other carbapenems, the antipseudomonal activity was reduced against d2-deficient strains. staphylococci and streptococci were susceptible (mic90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus aureus and 0.015 micrograms/ml for group a streptococci). l-627 also had activity against anaerobic bacteria (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis). neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis were highly susceptible (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), and against the common respiratory pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis), the mic90s were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. the protein binding of l-627 ranged from 13.8 to 22%, depending on the concentration. the presence of human serum had little effect on the mic or mbc of l-627. these results suggest that l-627 merits further study in the treatment of infections caused by a wide range of pathogens.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vitro activities of e1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic of e1077 for 90% of the strains tested [mic90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. against enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), e1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. the mic90s of e1077 for streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; e1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. e1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). the activity of e1077 against p. aeruginosa (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. in vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. e1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. the protective effects of e1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of e1077 caused swelling of s. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in p. aeruginosa. in general, the antibacterial profile of e1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of the new antibiotic vermisporin.
the antimicrobial activity of vermisporin, a new antibiotic produced by fermentation of the fungus ophiobolus vermisporis, was tested in vitro. vermisporin inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. at 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-2 micrograms/ml). vermisporin inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, at 0.5 micrograms/ml (range 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml). vermisporin mics for group a, b, c, f and g streptococci were < 1 microgram/ml when tested in haemophilus test medium but > or = 8 micrograms/ml in the presence of blood. vermisporin mics for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae exceeded 64 micrograms/ml. inhibited organisms had mbcs 16- to 32-fold above the mics.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
[sputum penetration of levofloxacin and its clinical efficacy in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infections].
sputum penetration of levofloxacin (lvfx) was evaluated after a single oral dose  of 100 mg or 200 mg to 4 patients with copious purulent sputa. the sputum concentration of lvfx reached maximum levels of 1.27 and 4.36 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, and still remained at concentrations of 0.32 and 1.68 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration of 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively. the auc ratio of sputum/serum was 0.9-1.0, indicating good sputum penetration of lvfx in these patients. the clinical efficacy and the safety of lvfx were also evaluated in a total of 13 patients with respiratory tract infections associated with bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, etc. lvfx was administered orally at a daily dose of 200 mg once a day, 100 mg t.i.d. or 200 mg t.i.d. for 7-28 days (mean 14.7 days). the clinical response to the drug was rated as excellent in 1 case, good in 5, fair in 3, and poor in 2 cases in 11 evaluable cases, thus the efficacy rate was 54.5%. all the 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae were eradicated. of the 3 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, eradication, decrease, and unchange was observed for 1 strain each. one strain of streptococcus pneumoniae remained unchanged. no adverse reaction was observed except for 1 case with slight and temporary increase of eosinophils. the above results suggested that lvfx would be clinically useful in the treatment of chronic lower respiratory tract infections.
in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
[a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
in vitro activity of temafloxacin against gram-negative bacteria: an overview.
the in vitro activities of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against gram-negative bacteria are compared. the 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic90s) of temafloxacin for respiratory pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, bordetella pertussis, and legionella pneumophila are less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. temafloxacin is also active against bacterial agents of sexually transmitted diseases, including neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 less than or equal to 0.015 micrograms/ml) and chlamydia trachomatis (mic90 0.25 micrograms/ml). for strains of enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, vibrio, aeromonas, and acinetobacter, temafloxacin is generally inhibitory at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. the mic90 of temafloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher than that of ciprofloxacin, approximately 4 micrograms/ml versus 0.5 micrograms/ml. this activity, combined with its pharmacokinetic characteristics, should make temafloxacin an effective antimicrobial agent against infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.
antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of sr 44337, a new long acting cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of sr 44337 was compared with that of other broad-spectrum  parenteral cephalosporins, plus imipenem and co-amoxiclav. sr 44337 showed good activity against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic90s of less than 0.5 mg/l against all species tested, with the exception of citrobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). of the agents tested, only ceftriaxone showed consistently greater activity against this family of organisms. sr 44337 had higher activity than ceftriaxone against acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was the most active agent tested against neisseria meningitidis (mic90 0.004 mg/l). all strains of n. gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and the streptococci (excluding the enterococci) were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l of sr 44337, which was also the most active cephalosporin tested against staphylococcus aureus. sr 44337 was stable to hydrolysis by the tem-1, shv-1 and p99 beta-lactamases, and was more stable than ceftriaxone to the k-1 beta-lactamase.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
pefloxacin therapy for nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit.
nosocomial infections occurring in an intensive care unit (icu) are commonly caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli or staphylococcus aureus, which are frequently multi-resistant and difficult to treat and contribute significantly to the patients' morbidity in the icu. pefloxacin, with its wide range of antimicrobial activity, lack of serious side-effects and advantageous kinetics, is a useful drug for use in this group of critically ill patients. pefloxacin has achieved a greater than 70% clinical cure rate and a microbiological response of over 80% in cases of nosocomial pneumonia in the icu. failure and superinfection has occurred with the development of resistance, particularly in pseudomonas aeruginosa in a small number of cases, but this can be prevented by combination antimicrobial therapy. serious side-effects, including confusion, psychiatric disturbance and other neurological abnormalities were rare and resolved on withdrawal of the drug. drug interactions occur with cimetidine and theophylline but are usually not clinically relevant; significant interaction with warfarin occurs and the dose of warfarin needs careful adjustment. pefloxacin is a valuable drug for use in bacteriologically proven sensitive infections and combination with aminoglycosides or beta-lactam agents should prevent the development of resistance.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro activity of e-1040, a 3-substituted cephalosporin, against pathogens from cystic fibrosis sputum.
on the basis of preliminary in vitro data, we evaluated e-1040, a new cephalosporin, against 188 cystic fibrosis (cf) sputum isolates obtained from 26 cf centers in the united states. these isolates included mucoid and nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and escherichia coli. in addition to mics measured under standard conditions, selected isolates were tested at various ph values, inoculum sizes, and diluent (cf serum and sputum) conditions. e-1040 activities (mics for 50 and 90% of the strains) against the isolates were as follows: p. aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid), 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; p. cepacia, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml; s. aureus, 8 and 8 micrograms/ml; h. influenzae, 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; and e. coli, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. e-1040 activity against mucoid p. aeruginosa was 4-fold greater than that of aztreonam, 16-fold greater than that of ceftazidime, and 32-fold greater than that of piperacillin. e-1040 was similar to other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against s. aureus, h. influenzae, and e. coli. bactericidal activity was less than or equal to 1 dilution of mic for 88% of the strains, although kinetic studies with mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa demonstrated effective killing only at eight times the mic. variations in ph from 5 to 8, in inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml, and in diluent (cf serum or cf sputum) did not affect e-1040 activity.
[clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.
comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.
comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, am-1091.
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, am-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. am-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. for many species am-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. it inhibited enterobacter, citrobacter, and klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. ninety percent of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species am-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. am-1091 was more active against pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. am-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. am-1091 inhibited 90% of the bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. the frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. although am-1091 had lower in vitro activity at ph 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. am-1091 rapidly killed escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
in vitro activity of pd 117596-2, a broad-spectrum difluoroquinolone.
the activity of pd 117596-2, a novel quinolone, was compared to that of other quinolones, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin. pd 117596-2 inhibited most enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 0.25 micrograms/ml, being equal or superior in activity to ciprofloxacin and 2- to 4-fold more active than ofloxacin. it inhibited ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp. and serratia marcescens. the mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa, including strains with imipenem mics of 8 micrograms/ml and gentamicin mics greater than 16 micrograms/ml, was 0.25 micrograms/ml. pd 117596-2 was more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas cepacia and pseudomonas maltophilia, and it inhibited neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae at less than 0.03 micrograms/ml. pd 117596-2 inhibited staphylococci at 0.5 micrograms/ml, being 2-fold superior to other quinolones, and with an mic of 0.25 micrograms/ml was more active against group a, b, c and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. mics for bacteroides spp. were 2 micrograms/ml compared to 8-32 micrograms/ml for other agents. the frequency of spontaneous resistance was low (less than 10(-10]. differences in mics and mbcs were within one dilution, and there was a minimal effect of inoculum size. although pd 117596-2 was less active at ph 5.5, mics were less than 0.5 micrograms/ml.
in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
in vitro antibacterial activity of sm-7338, a carbapenem antibiotic with stability to dehydropeptidase i.
sm-7338, a new carbapenem antibiotic, was demonstrated to have potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of aerobes, including staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes in a collection of 1,102 unselected clinical isolates. at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml, sm-7338 inhibited 90% of these strains. the spectrum of activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was more limited, and many of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were resistant to these agents, piperacillin, or gentamicin. a collection of ofloxacin-resistant strains was inhibited by sm-7338 or imipenem at 4 micrograms/ml. sm-7338 was more active than metronidazole and clindamycin against anaerobes. of the carbapenems, imipenem had greater activity against staphylococci but sm-7338 was much more active against haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria spp. and all genera of enterobacteriaceae tested. the mic of sm-7338 for 90% of these strains ranged from less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.13 micrograms/ml. when tested against 124 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, sm-7338 inhibited 76% at 0.5 microgram/ml but imipenem inhibited only 15% at this concentration. both carbapenems exhibited similar activities against bacteroides spp., but sm-7338 was more active than imipenem against clostridium spp. the mbc of sm-7338 was most commonly the same as or twice the mic. sm-7338 and imipenem showed excellent activities against bacteria elaborating chromosome- or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including those conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. the activity of sm-7338 was generally unaffected by the culture medium used, ph, 25% human serum, and inoculum size, but the susceptibility of xanthomonas maltophilia was medium dependent.
in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
in-vitro and in-vivo activities of t-3262, a new pyridone carboxylic acid.
t-3262[p-toluenesulfonic acid salt of dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1, 8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate] is a new pyridone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of t-3262 against most enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin except proteus spp. and providencia rettgeri and exceeded that of ofloxacin and norfloxacin. the activity of t-3262 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin, and t-3262 was more active than the other new quinolones against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, and also against staphylococci, streptococci, and bacteroides fragilis. the protective effects of a single oral dose of t-3262 on systemic infection in mice were greater than norfloxacin. t-3262 was as effective as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against systemic infections in an animal model with escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and more active against ps. aeruginosa infections. t-3262 showed excellent activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, t-3262 (a-60969).
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, t-3262 [a-60969; dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. t-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. ninety percent of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. it was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against pseudomonas cepacia and pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. the mic for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for enterococcus faecalis. it inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. t-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus.
a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
[susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro23-6240; am 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and a-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was also extremely active against aeromonas hydrophila and haemophilus influenzae isolates with mic90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. the mic90 for three different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. fleroxacin was also active against group jk-diphtheroids and bacillus cereus. the overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of a-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
in vitro studies of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (mic 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. tobramycin was highly active against p. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. the quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. all the quinolones showed high activity against staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. the pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (mic range 4-32 mg/l). all isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). cefuroxime was also highly active against n. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against h. influenzae. the quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates (mic range 1-16 mg/l). the mics of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at ph 8.8 than those obtained at ph 5.8 and 7.3. the activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in ph.
[pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of aspoxicillin in pediatric patients].
since the efficacy and the safety of aspoxicillin (aspc, ta-058) have been established on adult patients and the need of aspc use on pediatric patients was anticipated, we performed a 16 center study on the clinical utility of aspc in pediatric patients. 1. pharmacokinetics aspc was intravenously administered to 45 patients at a dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg by one shot. serum concentrations of aspc were dependent of dose levels, and maximum levels of 58.4-230.8 micrograms/ml and half-lives (beta) of 1.08-1.16 hours were observed. urinary recovery rates were 62.7-67.2% in 6 hours. results obtained upon drip infusions (0.5-1 hour) were similar to one shot injections. 2. clinical results (1) clinical effectiveness of 318 evaluable patients including 175 boys and 143 girls, 18.2% were nurslings and 61% were young children under 4 years of age. one hundred eighty six patients from whom causative organisms were isolated were classified as a group. among them were 5 patients suffered with sepsis, but the aspc treatment eradicated all the bacteria but salmonella java in 1 case. all of 4 patients with meningitis were cured and all causative organisms (3 cases with haemophilus influenzae and 1 case with gram-positive coccus) were eradicated. cure rates were 90% for 130 patients with respiratory tract infection, 88.6% for 35 with urinary tract infection, 85.7% for 7 with skin soft tissue infection and 89.8% for all the a group patients. meanwhile, no causative organisms were isolated from 132 patients (b group patients) but cure rate of 91.7% was obtained for this group. no statistical difference was observed between a and b groups. for all the patients (318), the cure rate was 90.6%. (2) bacteriological effects of 63 gram-positive bacteria isolated as pathogens, 58 strains were eradicated. of 117 gram-negative bacterial, 101 were eradicated. the eradication rate on all 180 strains was 88.3%. overall, aspc showed excellent effects against streptococcus. among strains of staphylococcus aureus, 18 of 20 strains were eradicated. of 59 strains of h. influenzae, 52 were eradicated and 3 decreased. among strains of escherichia coli, 25 of 28 strains were eradicated. of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 strains were decreased and one was unchanged. (3) aspc was effective in 93.3% of 30 patients with serious infections and 79.2% of 72 patients with underlying diseases. cure rates for patients with and without underlying disease were significantly different statistically (chi 2: p less than 0.005).(abstract truncated at 400 words)
selective procedure to isolate haemophilus influenzae from sputa with large quantities of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the identification of respiratory pathogens (e. g. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae) is impaired by the presence of large quantities of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as is the case in the sputum specimens of cystic fibrosis patients. a procedure has been evaluated whereby the selective inhibition of the proliferation of p. aeruginosa is achieved by a broad spectrum pyocin, whereas the growth of h. influenzae is not influenced. this technique has been tested over a two year period resulting in a significantly augmented rate of identification of h. influenzae.
efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of serious respiratory infections.
fifty-two patients with serious respiratory infections were treated with orally administered ciprofloxacin; 42 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis and all were evaluable for determining adverse reactions. cures were achieved in 24 patients with infections (14 with bronchitis, 10 with pneumonia) caused by hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or branhamella catarrhalis, and pathogens were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. seventeen patients had infections (seven bronchitis, 10 pneumonia) caused by enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa; many of these patients were critically ill and were enrolled in the study because their pathogens were resistant to multiple drugs or because their infections had not responded to alternate antimicrobial therapy. all patients had favorable clinical responses, and members of the enterobacteriaceae were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. however, five of 12 strains of p. aeruginosa persisted during treatment; minimal inhibitory concentrations for these strains increased 4- to 16-fold as infections continued to resolve. one patient with staphylococcus aureus infection also showed a response. ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea, vomiting, or both in three of the 52 patients and possibly contributed to similar symptoms in another three patients (6 to 12 percent). other possible adverse reactions, including central nervous system symptoms, were also observed but were not clearly drug-related.
in vitro evaluation of tigemonam, a novel oral monobactam.
tigemonam, a novel, orally administered monobactam, exhibited potent and specific activity in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. its activity was variable to poor against gram-positive bacteria, acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes. within its spectrum of activity, tigemonam was far superior to oral antibiotics currently available, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. in addition, tigemonam was superior to cefuroxime, which is under development as an oral pro-drug, and more active than cefixime against several genera of the enterobacteriaceae. the activity of tigemonam against the enteric bacteria, haemophilus species, and neisseria species was, in general, comparable to that of the quinolone norfloxacin. the excellent activity of tigemonam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria reflected its marked stability to hydrolysis by isolated enzymes. the expanded spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria observed with tigemonam thus extends oral beta-lactam coverage to include members of the enterobacteriaceae that are intrinsically or enzymatically resistant to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins.
the comparative in-vitro activity of eight newer quinolones and nalidixic acid.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and the 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, a-56619, a-56620 and ci-934 was assessed by determination of mics. the 4-quinolones were all highly active against most isolates of enterobacteriaceae, including nalidixic acid-resistant strains. ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-2 mg/l) was the most active and a-56619 (mics 0.008-32 mg/l) was the least active. a-56619, a-56620, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ci-934 were highly active against acinetobacter strains, pefloxacin and enoxacin were slightly less active, and a few strains were resistant to norfloxacin. all the compounds, including nalidixic acid, were active against aeromonas strains (mics 0.001-0.12 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) was the most active compound against pseudomonas aeruginosa; a-56619 and ci-934 (mics 1-16 mg/l) were the least active against this species. all the compounds were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae but the activity of all the compounds was poor against most isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. all the 4-quinolones were active against staphylococci and ci-934 (mics 0.03-0.25 mg/l) was the most active. ci-934 (mics 0.06-2 mg/l) was also the most active compound against all streptococci. most streptococci were sensitive also to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) but there were many isolates resistant to the other 4-quinolones. against the anaerobic bacteria ci-934 was again the most active compound, particularly against the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin had poor activity against most anaerobes. ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, a-56619 and a-56620 had good to moderate activity against all species of anaerobes except the bacteroides fragilis group, against which none of the compounds was very active.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro activity of ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
the activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, ro 15-8074 and ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. both were highly active (mic for 90% of the strains tested [mic 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. there was no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against morganella morganii (in the case of ro 15-8074), enterobacter sp., and citrobacter sp. staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to ro 19-5247 (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), but ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. the protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for ro 19-5247. the major target site for the two cephalosporins was pbp 3.
the activity of bmy 28142 a new broad spectrum beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio c-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. bmy 28142 was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 inhibited many enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 was more active than imipenem against proteus, providencia and morganella species. ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than bmy 28142 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. bmy 28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. bmy 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. bmy 28142 did not inhibit most bacteroides species. bmy 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the tem plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.
[in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections to beta-lactam antibiotics].
in vitro susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens to beta-lactam antibiotics were  determined. bacterial pathogens examined included various isolates from the patients of respiratory tract infections at the hospitals of kyoto-shiga area in 1981 and 1983. major organisms isolated from clinical specimens were haemophilus spp., klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp., s. aureus and streptococcus spp. an increase in the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa, a decrease in the isolation frequency of h. influenzae and no change in the isolation frequency of the other organisms were observed between the years 1981 and 1983. data from susceptibility tests of clinical isolates confirmed that cefazolin (cez) and cefotiam (ctm) showed good antibacterial activity against s. aureus and cefmenoxime (cmx) was highly effective on streptococcus spp., but that the susceptibilities of both organisms to cez, ctm, and cefmetazole (cmz) in 1983 were lower than in 1981. although cmx also showed good antibacterial activity against klebsiella spp., there were no changes in the effectiveness of ctm, cmz, and cez between the years 1981 and 1983. the in vitro antibacterial activities of cmx and cefoperazone against haemophilus spp. were superior to those of the other beta-lactams tested, but there was a decline in the efficacy for cez. although cefsulodin and piperacillin were highly active against pseudomonas spp., declines in their effectiveness was observed between the years 1981 and 1983.
in vitro evaluation of a-56619 (difloxacin) and a-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
the in vitro antibacterial potencies of a-56619 and a-56620, two new aryl-fluoroquinolones, were compared with the potency of norfloxacin against a broad spectrum of organisms. cefotaxime, aztreonam, piperacillin, imipenem, penicillin, and gentamicin were also tested for reference purposes. the mics required to inhibit at least 90% of the strains tested ranged from 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml for a-56619 and from 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for a-56620 for members of the enterobacteriaceae. a-56619 was generally twofold less potent and a-56620 was twofold more potent than norfloxacin against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including members of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. against indole-positive proteus, morganella, providencia rettgeri, and serratia strains, a-56619 was at least 8- to 16-fold less potent than norfloxacin. a-56619 and a-56620 were four- to eightfold more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and equally potent to fourfold more potent against streptococcus species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mics of a-56619 and a-56620 were only slightly affected by increased inoculum size or by the addition of various cations at physiologic concentrations. a-56619 was three- to fivefold less active at ph 8.0 than at ph 6.5 or 7.2. a-56620 was twofold less active at ph 6.5 than at ph 8.0 or 7.2 against members of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa; similar ph variations did not affect a-56620 activity against gram-positive cocci. the potencies of a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin were less in urine than in mueller-hinton broth; however, this effect was more pronounced with norfloxacin. human serum at a concentration of 50% caused a 4- to 64- fold decrease in the potency of a-56619 and an average 4-fold decrease in the potency of a-56620, compared with no effect on the potency of norfloxacin. a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin were bactericidal and, at four times the mic, reduced the viable cell counts of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa by approximately 99.9% within 2 h. a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin showed no significant synergistic activity and no antagonism when they were aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
aztreonam: antibacterial activity, beta-lactamase stability, and interpretive standards and quality control guidelines for disk-diffusion susceptibility tests.
in vitro activity of aztreonam was compared with that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 656 representative bacterial pathogens. aztreonam was not active against gram-positive cocci but was as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against the enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. additional data for 5,262 gram-negative bacilli isolated in four separate medical centers documented the low incidence of resistance to aztreonam; 97.2% of 4,312 isolates of enterobacteriaceae and 79% of 854 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms of aztreonam/ml. additional studies confirmed the stability of aztreonam in the presence of seven different beta-lactamases. for disk-diffusion susceptibility tests, 30-micrograms disks are recommended, with interpretive breakpoints of less than or equal to 15 mm for resistance (mic greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml), 16-21 mm for intermediate susceptibility (mic, 16 micrograms/ml), and greater than or equal to 22 mm for susceptibility (mic less than 8.0 micrograms/ml). for quality control of tests with 30-micrograms disks, zone-size limits for escherichia coli (atcc 25922) should be 28-36 mm and those for p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853) should be 23-29 mm.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
in vitro and in vivo activities of dn-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
dn-9550 [(6r, 7r)-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of dn-9550 against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens, dn-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. dn-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but dn-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to dn-9550, but bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. dn-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. when dn-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
hr 810 and bmy-28142, two new cephalosporins with broad-spectrum activity: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in-vitro activity of the new parenteral cephalosporins, hr 810 (hr) and bmy-28142 (bmy), was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, against a total of 315 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. against all species of the enterobacteriaceae tested, both hr and bmy were as active as, or slightly more active than, cefotaxime. hr differed from cefotaxime mainly in being eight-fold more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and two-fold more active against staphylococcus aureus. bmy was also eight-fold more active than cefotaxime against ps. aeruginosa but was two-fold less active than the latter against staph. aureus. both new compounds had good activity against haemophilus influenzae, including the beta-lactamase producing strains of that species, and both had poor activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
temocillin. in vitro activity compared with other antibiotics.
temocillin is a recently developed penicillin with a methoxy group in the 6-alpha position. the in vitro activity of temocillin was studied using 932 recent clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, and its activity was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. temocillin was active against the enterobacteriaceae, with narrow ranges of mics and mic90 values (less than or equal to 8 mg/l) for all isolates except serratia marcescens and enterobacter species. moreover, the compound was active against 46 multiresistant enterobacteriaceae strains. the drug was also strongly active against haemophilus influenzae, with beta-lactamase-producing strains being as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. temocillin showed no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter or gram-positive cocci, and had only discrete activity against the bacteroides fragilis group. in general, temocillin displayed the same spectrum of activity against enterobacteriaceae as third generation cephalosporins, but with a substantially lower intrinsic activity.
in vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. on the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin b against klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin b against pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against staphylococcus aureus, (mic90 = 2 mg/l in each case). along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against moraxella species. compared to erythromycin (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (mic90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. these results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
asian multicenter trial of cefoperazone in respiratory tract infection.
the safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated in a multicenter  trial conducted at institutions in japan, korea, and taiwan. cefoperazone was given as the sole antibiotic for 481 respiratory tract infections in 476 patients. an overall satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 73.7% of patients. cefoperazone was effective in 78.9% of cases of pneumonia, 81.1% of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and 69.4% of bronchiectasis with infection. a satisfactory bacteriological effect was obtained in 93.2% of cases in which haemophilus influenzae was isolated, 70.2% of klebsiella infections, and 84.6% of infections with streptococcus pneumoniae. although the eradication rate was only 38.6% in patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa, the success rate increases to 59.1% if patients showing a decrease in the number of organisms are included. cefoperazone was effective in 63.5% of the 148 cases that had failed to respond to treatment with other antibiotics. adverse reactions occurred in 8.0% of patients and consisted primarily of rash, diarrhea, and fever. cefoperazone appears to be an extremely useful injectable antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
during the period from september 1981 to march 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in japan. of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. the data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. in respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. the present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
naturally occurring antibodies in human sera that react with haemophilus influenzae type b ribosomal vaccine.
sera from populations of normal adults and children as well as sera from children with systemic haemophilus influenzae type b disease were tested for antibodies reacting with ribosomes from h. influenzae type b. adults generally had high titers of antibody, with 90% having titers greater than 1:64. the distribution of titers approximated a normal curve. among normal children, there was more variability between individual titers, with the median titers ranging between 1:64 and 1:128. in contrast, acute-phase sera from children with systemic h. influenzae type b disease all had titers of 1:16 or less. two convalescent-phase sera had high titers. absorption experiments ruled out cross-reaction between ribosomes and type b capsular material. ribosomes from two unrelated type b strains were completely cross-reactive, whereas absorption with ribosomes from a type c strain led to significantly decreased titers in three of four sera. absorption of sera with ribosomes from pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae also decreased titers, indicating that these antibodies may have been induced by ribosomes of other bacteria.
n-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was employed. n-f thienamycin was active against all enterobacteriaceae isolates (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. n-f thienamycin was also active against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and gram-positive cocci. all enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. the drug was active against haemophilus influenzae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and the bacteroides fragilis group (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). cefoxitin was inactive against most enterobacter and a. calcoaceticus isolates and all p. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. tobramycin was virtually inactive against gram-positive cocci other than staphylococcus aureus. n-f thienamycin thus has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.
comparative in-vitro activity of temocillin (brl 17421), a new penicillin.
the activity in vitro of the new parenteral penicillin, temocillin, was determined by an agar dilution technique at two inocula against 201 recent clinical isolates and also against reference strains that produced characterized beta-lactamases. ampicillin, ticarcillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefoxitin were used as comparative agents. temocillin showed no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or the bacteroides fragilis group but was highly active against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates (serratia marcescens excepted) at less than or equal to 8 mg/l. the mic50 and mic90 were usually within one dilution and results with both inoculum sizes were similar. temocillin also had good activity against haemophilus influenzae and beta-lactamase producing strains were as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase producers. neither for the enterobacteriaceae nor for h. influenzae did a 1000-fold increase in inoculum result in a greater than two-fold increase in mic. the above results implied excellent stability to beta-lactamases and this was borne out by the activity of temocillin against strains containing chromosomal cephalosporinases, the 'broad-spectrum' class iv enzyme and the plasmid mediated enzymes tem-1, oxa-1 and shv-1. the protein binding of temocillin was found to be 87%.
cefotetan: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active against most staphylococci (mics 4 to 8 mg/l) though methicillin-resistant strains were less sensitive. it was also generally active against streptococci (mics mostly in the range 1 to 16 mg/l). however, enterococci and penicillin-resistant pneumococci were resistant. cefotetan was highly active against enterobacteria, with 75% of isolates inhibited by 0.5 mg/l and 90% inhibited by 4 mg/l. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae (mics 0.5 to 4 mg/l) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics 0.06 to 2 mg/l) but had relatively poor activity against acinetobacter spp. (mics mostly 4 to 128 mg/l). cefotetan had little useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics 16 to 512 mg/l) but was more active against most other pseudomonads. cefotetan had moderate activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mics mostly less than or equal to 32 mg/l), though bact. fragilis sensu stricto and bact. vulgatus were more sensitive (mics usually less than or equal to 4 mg/l). it was more active against most other anaerobes, though its activity was always exceeded by that of ampicillin. cefotetan possessed a high degree of resistance to both plasmid-mediated and chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
antibacterial activity of the cephamycin cefotetan: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the cephamycin, cefotetan, was compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics including the monocyclic beta-lactam, azthreonam, against a total of 277 recent clinical isolates. cefotetan had activity comparable to moxalactam against staphylococcus aureus and against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates except for serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp. at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. cefotetan was active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 mg/l); was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l); and was eightfold less active than cefoxitin against the bacteroides fragilis group. azthreonam was as active as moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae and was more active than moxalactam against ps. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 mg/l, but was inactive against the bact. fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l) and against staphylococcus aureus (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections. this bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in the treatment of respiratory infections. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae 53, haemophilus influenzae 64, klebsiella pneumoniae 43, escherichia coli 9, enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. in vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. in 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. from these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.
comparative in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. n-formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. it inhibited methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited listeria. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, serratia, indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. there was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. n-formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against s. aureus, s. faecalis, and many pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. it was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with mics mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (mics > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mics 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mics 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (mics 0.12-0.25 mg/l). ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (mics mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mics mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). however it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics mostly 1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against bacteroides spp. (mics mostly 16-64 mg/l for bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. the compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including oxa-1 and the enzymes from klebsiella 1082e and proteus vulgaris pc37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. however, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of bact. fragilis.
comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.
brl 17421, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic, highly resistant to beta-lactamases, giving high and prolonged serum levels in humans.
brl 17421 is a new semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotic with an unusual spectrum  of antibacterial activity. the compound exhibits exceptional stability to a wide range of bacterial beta-lactamases and is active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae, including strains highly resistant to many of the penicillins and cephalosporins currently available. among the clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae tested, the frequency of strains resistant to brl 17421 was found to be low, and there was a slow rate of emergence of resistance during in vitro studies. brl 17421 was highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the compound was markedly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis than against the enterobacteriaceae. against the gram-positive bacteria, brl 17421 showed a very low level of activity. brl 17421 was found to be 85% bound to human serum, and the antibacterial activity was diminished two- to fourfold in the presence of human serum. against experimental infections in mice, the activity of brl 17421 reflected the properties observed in vitro. studies in human volunteers showed unusually high and prolonged serum concentrations of the compound after parenteral dosage, with a serum half-life of about 5 h, and approximately 85% of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine. brl 17421 was poorly absorbed after oral administration. the compound was well tolerated after intramuscular and intravenous administration in volunteers, with no adverse side effects.
polymyxin b inactivation of lipopolysaccharide in vaccines of gram-negative bacteria.
endotoxin activity in suspensions of bordetella pertussis, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was often markedly decreased by polymyxin b. polymyxin b treatment may be a means to reduce inflammatory reactivity of lipopolysaccharide in vaccines of gram-negative bacteria.
comparative in vitro studies of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the spectra of activity and potency of ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were quite similar; they were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis. moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. all six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group d streptococci. the action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. the only exception to this was found when large inocula of staphylococcus aureus were tested. increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ro 13-9904 against 245 clinical isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. the activity of ro 13-9904 against most enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of cefotaxime; it was slightly more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, providencia species, and serratia marcescens, but slightly less active against klebsiella species. ro 13-9904 was twofold more active than cefotaxime and threefold more active than ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean mic of 7.2 micrograms/ml; isolates highly resistant to ticarcillin were inhibited by a mean mic of 17.2 micrograms/ml. ro 13-9904 was fourfold more active than ampicillin against susceptible haemophilus influenzae and was equally active against beta-lactamase-producing isolates. ro 13-9904 was highly active against pneumococci and moderately active (mic, 4 micrograms/ml) against staphylococcus aureus isolates, whether they were susceptible or resistant to penicillin g. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus and streptococcus faecalis were completely resistant to ro 13-9904 (mic, greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all proteus species. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. it was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than ampicillin against both bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from b. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of enterobacter cloacae.
hr 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. hr 756 inhibited neisseria and haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae and h. influenzae. hr 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, enterobacter, and shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. it was twice as active as carbenicillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. hr 756 killed e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and p. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from single sputa of cystic fibrosis patients.
a phenotypic characterization of pseudomonas aeruginosa from single sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, pigmentation, and serotype. two or more isolates with different but stable susceptibilities to carbenicillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa. differences generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain. o-antigen group determination with the difco typing set showed that two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21 sputum specimens. nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of their parent strain. these data suggest that cystic fibrosis patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by different strains of p. aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed. alternatively, phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain. because of the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct p. aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. we recommend that several colonies of each distinguishable colony type of p. aeruginosa be pooled for the antibiogram.
clavulanic acid, a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
clavulanic acid, z-(2r,5r)-3-(beta-hydroxyethylidene)-7-oxo-4-oxa-1-azabicyclo-[3,2,0] heptane-2-carboxylic acid, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of the beta-lactamases of the richmond types ii, iii, iv, and v. inhibition is a time-dependent reaction and is irreversible. clavulanic acid had poor antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory levels greater than 25 mug/ml. it did inhibit the majority of neisseria gonorrhoeae at 0.1 mug/ml and haemophilus influenzae at 6.3 mug/ml. clavulanic acid acted synergistically with penicillins and cephalosporins to inhibit beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae. clavulanic acid combined with ampicillin inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, and shigella sonnei.
comparison of the in vitro activity of bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new antipseudomonal broad-spectrum penicillins, with other beta-lactam drugs.
bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new substituted ampicillins, were compared with  other beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin, against a wide range of gram-positive and -negative organisms. bay k 4999 and piperacillin were extremely active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml), being about 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. bay k 4999 was the most active drug against escherichia coli (50% inhibited by 0.5 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml). piperacillin and bay k 4999 were equally active against proteus spp., and piperacillin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (50% inhibited by between 1 and 2 mug/ml).
in vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
the in vitro activity of piperacillin (t-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin was slightly more active against neisseria and haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. piperacillin was active against all members of the enterobacteriaceae including the klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. the activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. most striking was its activity on pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain p. aeruginosa strains. a complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. however, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
