TI  == the female urinary microbiome: a comparison of women with and without urgency urinary incontinence.
AB  == bacterial dna and live bacteria have been detected in human urine in the absence  of clinical infection, challenging the prevailing dogma that urine is normally sterile. urgency urinary incontinence (uui) is a poorly understood urinary condition characterized by symptoms that overlap urinary infection, including urinary urgency and increased frequency with urinary incontinence. the recent discovery of the urinary microbiome warrants investigation into whether bacteria  contribute to uui. in this study, we used 16s rrna gene sequencing to classify bacterial dna and expanded quantitative urine culture (equc) techniques to isolate live bacteria in urine collected by using a transurethral catheter from women with uui and, in comparison, a cohort without uui. for these cohorts, we demonstrated that the uui and non-uui urinary microbiomes differ by group based on both sequence and culture evidences. compared to the non-uui microbiome, sequencing experiments revealed that the uui microbiome was composed of increased gardnerella and decreased lactobacillus. nine genera (actinobaculum, actinomyces, aerococcus, arthrobacter, corynebacterium, gardnerella, oligella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus) were more frequently cultured from the uui cohort. although lactobacillus was isolated from both cohorts, distinctions existed at the species level, with lactobacillus gasseri detected more frequently in the uui cohort and  lactobacillus crispatus most frequently detected in controls. combined, these data suggest that potentially important differences exist in the urinary microbiomes of women with and without uui, which have strong implications in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of uui. importance: new evidence indicates that the human urinary tract contains microbial communities; however, the role of these communities in urinary health remains to be elucidated. urgency urinary incontinence (uui) is a highly prevalent yet poorly understood urinary condition  characterized by urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. given the significant overlap of uui symptoms with those of urinary tract infections, it is possible that uui may have a microbial component. we compared the urinary microbiomes of women affected by uui to those of a comparison group without uui,  using both high-throughput sequencing and extended culture techniques. we identified statistically significant differences in the frequency and abundance of bacteria present. these differences suggest a potential role for the urinary microbiome in female urinary health.

TI  == characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
AB  == background: lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri. results: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) fraction (47 out of 90). lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of lactobacillus positive infants) of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite,  and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and muc7, and purified mfgm, and adhered to  epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in 29.7% of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri (2.14 pg/ul) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/ul) or mfgm (0.697 pg/ul) formula. conclusions: lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == effectiveness of dentine bonding agents against cariogenic bacteria in vitro: a comparison of two methods.
AB  == data obtained from studies on the antimicrobial properties of bonding agents are  the subject of controversy, probably because of methodological differences. this  study compared two commonly used in vitro methods, the disc agar diffusion test and the well agar diffusion test. agar plates were seeded with streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus gasseri, or actinomyces naeslundii. for the well diffusion test, wells cut out of the agar were filled with the test material, and for the disc method, discs impregnated with the test material were applied to the agar; the discs and wells were both 9 mm in diameter. after incubation, measurements of the zones of inhibition showed little agreement between the two methods when bonding agents were tested; the mean differences (+/- sdiff) in the  zones of inhibition between the methods were 0.7 +/- 3.4 mm (p = 0.40, one sample t-test against zero), 4.9 +/- 4.4 mm (p = 0.97), and 0.8 +/- 4.3 mm (p = 0.47) for s. sobrinus, l. gasseri, and a. naeslundii, respectively. mean differences were less contrasting when chlorhexidine and pure components were tested (p < 0.05 for s. sobrinus and l. gasseri). these results indicate the need for a gold  standard method to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of bonding agents.
