TI  == tonb-dependent heme iron acquisition in the tsetse fly symbiont sodalis glossinidius.
AB  == sodalis glossinidius is an intra- and extracellular symbiont of the tsetse fly (glossina sp.), which feeds exclusively on vertebrate blood. s. glossinidius resides in a wide variety of tsetse tissues and may encounter environments that differ dramatically in iron content. the sodalis chromosome encodes a putative tonb-dependent outer membrane heme transporter (hemr) and a putative periplasmic/inner membrane abc heme permease system (hemtuv). because these gene  products mediate iron acquisition processes by other enteric bacteria, we characterized their regulation and physiological role in the sodalis/tsetse system. our results show that the hemr and tonb genes are expressed by s. glossinidius in the tsetse fly. furthermore, transcription of hemr in sodalis is  repressed in a high-iron environment by the iron-responsive transcriptional regulator fur. expression of the s. glossinidius hemr and hemtuv genes in an escherichia coli strain unable to use heme as an iron source stimulated growth in the presence of heme or hemoglobin as the sole iron source. this stimulation was  dependent on the presence of either the e. coli or sodalis tonb gene. sodalis tonb and hemr mutant strains were defective in their ability to colonize the gut  of tsetse flies that lacked endogenous symbionts, while wild-type s. glossinidius proliferated in this same environment. finally, we show that the sodalis hemr protein is localized to the bacterial membrane and appears to bind hemin. collectively, this study provides strong evidence that tonb-dependent, hemr-mediated iron acquisition is important for the maintenance of symbiont homeostasis in the tsetse fly, and it provides evidence for the expression of bacterial high-affinity iron acquisition genes in insect symbionts.

TI  == characterization of the achromobactin iron acquisition operon in sodalis glossinidius.
AB  == sodalis glossinidius is a facultative, extra- and intracellular symbiont found in most tissues of the tsetse fly (glossinia sp.). sodalis has a putative achromobactin siderophore iron acquisition system on the psg1 plasmid. reverse transcription (rt)-pcr analysis revealed that the achromobactin operon is transcribed as a single polycistronic molecule and is expressed when sodalis is within the tsetse fly. expression of the achromobactin operon was repressed under iron-replete conditions; in a mutant that lacks the iron-responsive transcriptional repressor protein fur, expression was aberrantly derepressed under these iron-replete conditions, indicating that the fur protein repressed achromobactin gene expression when iron was plentiful. a putative fur binding site within the sodalis achromobactin promoter bound fur in escherichia coli fur  titration assays. wild-type sodalis produced detectable siderophore in vitro, but a mutation in the putative achromobactin biosynthesis gene acsd eliminated detectable siderophore production in sodalis. reduced growth of the siderophore synthesis mutant was reconstituted by addition of exogenous achromobactin, suggesting the strain retains a functional siderophore transport system; however, reduced growth of a sodalis ferric-siderophore outer membrane receptor mutant with a mutation in acr was not reconstituted by exogenous siderophore due to its  defective transporter. the sodalis siderophore synthesis mutant showed reduced growth in tsetse that lacked endogenous symbionts (aposymbiotic) when the flies were inoculated with sodalis intrathoracically, but not when inoculated per os. our findings suggest that sodalis siderophores play a role in iron acquisition in certain tsetse fly tissues and provide evidence for the regulation of iron acquisition mechanisms in insect symbionts.

TI  == metabolic networks of sodalis glossinidius: a systems biology approach to reductive evolution.
AB  == background: genome reduction is a common evolutionary process affecting bacterial lineages that establish symbiotic or pathogenic associations with eukaryotic hosts. such associations yield highly reduced genomes with greatly streamlined metabolic abilities shaped by the type of ecological association with the host. sodalis glossinidius, the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies, represents one  of the few complete genomes available of a bacterium at the initial stages of this process. in the present study, genome reduction is studied from a systems biology perspective through the reconstruction and functional analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks of s. glossinidius. results: the functional profile of ancestral and extant metabolic networks sheds light on the evolutionary events underlying transition to a host-dependent lifestyle. meanwhile, reductive evolution simulations on the extant metabolic network can predict possible future evolution of s. glossinidius in the context of genome reduction. finally, knockout simulations in different metabolic systems reveal a  gradual decrease in network robustness to different mutational events for bacterial endosymbionts at different stages of the symbiotic association. conclusions: stoichiometric analysis reveals few gene inactivation events whose effects on the functionality of s. glossinidius metabolic systems are drastic enough to account for the ecological transition from a free-living to host-dependent lifestyle. the decrease in network robustness across different metabolic systems may be associated with the progressive integration in the more  stable environment provided by the insect host. finally, reductive evolution simulations reveal the strong influence that external conditions exert on the evolvability of metabolic systems.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of bacteriophage ep23 infecting shigella sonnei and  escherichia coli.
AB  == bacteriophage ep23 that infects escherichia coli and shigella sonnei was isolated and characterized. the bacteriophage morphology was similar to members of the family siphoviridae. the 44,077 bp genome was fully sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing. comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that ep23 was most closely related to phage so-1, which infects sodalis glossinidius and phage ssl-2009a, which infects engineered e. coli. genomic comparison indicated that ep23 and so-1 were very similar with each other in terms of gene order and amino acid similarity, even though their hosts were separated in the level of genus. ep23 and ssl-2009a displayed high amino acid similarity between their genes, but there was evidence of several recombination events in ssl-2009a. the results of the comparative genomic analyses further the understanding of the evolution and relationship between ep23 and its bacteriophage relatives.

TI  == attenuation of the sensing capabilities of phoq in transition to obligate insect-bacterial association.
AB  == sodalis glossinidius, a maternally inherited endosymbiont of the tsetse fly, maintains genes encoding homologues of the phop-phoq two-component regulatory system. this two-component system has been extensively studied in facultative bacterial pathogens and is known to serve as an environmental magnesium sensor and a regulator of key virulence determinants. in the current study, we show that the inactivation of the response regulator, phop, renders s. glossinidius sensitive to insect derived cationic antimicrobial peptides (amps). the resulting mutant strain displays reduced expression of genes involved in the structural modification of lipid a that facilitates resistance to amps. in addition, the inactivation of phop alters the expression of type-iii secretion system (ttss) genes encoded within three distinct chromosomal regions, indicating that phop-phoq also serves as a master regulator of ttss gene expression. in the absence of phop, s. glossinidius is unable to superinfect either its natural tsetse fly host or a closely related hippoboscid louse fly. furthermore, we show  that the s. glossinidius phoq sensor kinase has undergone functional adaptations  that result in a substantially diminished ability to sense ancestral signals. the loss of phoq's sensory capability is predicted to represent a novel adaptation to the static symbiotic lifestyle, allowing s. glossinidius to constitutively express genes that facilitate resistance to host derived amps.

TI  == the phylogeny of sodalis-like symbionts as reconstructed using surface-encoding loci.
AB  == phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna support close relationships between the gammaproteobacteria sodalis glossinidius, a tsetse (diptera: glossinidae) symbiont, and bacteria infecting diverse insect orders. to further examine the evolutionary relationships of these sodalis-like symbionts, phylogenetic trees were constructed for a subset of putative surface-encoding genes (i.e. ompa, spr, slyb, rcsf, ycfm, and ompc). the ompa and ompc loci were used toward examining the intra- and interspecific diversity of sodalis within tsetse, respectively. intraspecific analyses of ompa support elevated nonsynonymous (dn) polymorphism with an excess of singletons, indicating diversifying selection, specifically within the tsetse glossina morsitans. additionally, interspecific ompc comparisons between sodalis and escherichia coli demonstrate deviation from neutrality, with higher fixed dn observed at sites associated with extracellular  loops. surface-encoding genes varied in their phylogenetic resolution of sodalis  and related bacteria, suggesting conserved vs. host-specific roles. moreover, sodalis and its close relatives exhibit genetic divergence at the rcsf, ompa, and ompc loci, indicative of initial molecular divergence. the application of outer membrane genes as markers for further delineating the systematics of recently diverged bacteria is discussed. these results increase our understanding of insect symbiont evolution, while also identifying early genome alterations occurring upon integration of microorganisms with eukaryotic hosts.

TI  == functional analysis of the twin-arginine translocation pathway in sodalis glossinidius, a bacterial symbiont of the tsetse fly.
AB  == this study demonstrates a functional twin-arginine (tat) translocation pathway present in the tsetse fly symbiont sodalis glossinidius and its potential to export active heterologous proteins to the periplasm. functionality was demonstrated using green fluorescent protein (gfp) fused to the tat signal peptide of escherichia coli trimethylamine n-oxide reductase (tora).

TI  == regulation of high-affinity iron acquisition homologues in the tsetse fly symbiont sodalis glossinidius.
AB  == sodalis glossinidius is a facultative intracellular bacterium that is a secondary symbiont of the tsetse fly (diptera: glossinidae). since studies with other facultative intracellular bacteria have shown that high-affinity iron acquisition genes are upregulated in vivo, we investigated the regulation of several sodalis  genes that encode putative iron acquisition systems. these genes, sg1538 (hemt) and sg1516 (sita), are homologous to genes encoding periplasmic heme and iron/manganese transporters, respectively. hemt promoter- and sita promoter-gfp fusions were constructed, and in both escherichia coli and sodalis backgrounds, expression levels of these fusions were higher when the bacteria were grown in iron-limiting media than when the bacteria were grown in iron-replete media. the  sodalis promoters were tested for iron regulation in an e. coli strain that lacks the fur gene, which encodes the iron-responsive transcriptional repressor fur. expression of the promoter-gfp fusions in the e. coli fur mutant was constitutively high in both iron-replete and iron-deplete media, and addition of  either shigella flexneri fur or sodalis fur to a plasmid restored normal regulation. a sodalis fur mutant was constructed by intron mutagenesis, and semiquantitative reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) showed that iron repression of sita expression was also abolished in this strain. in vivo expression analysis showed that hemt and sita are expressed when sodalis is within tsetse fly hosts,  suggesting a biological role for these genes when sodalis is within the tsetse fly.

TI  == an insect symbiosis is influenced by bacterium-specific polymorphisms in outer-membrane protein a.
AB  == beneficial bacterial symbioses are ubiquitous in nature. however, the functional  and molecular basis of host tolerance to resident symbiotic microbes, in contrast to resistance to closely related bacteria that are recognized as foreign, remain  largely unknown. we used the tsetse fly (glossina morsitans), which depends on symbiotic flora for fecundity and has limited exposure to foreign microbes, to investigate the tolerance phenomenon exhibited during symbiosis. we examined the  potential role of bacterium-specific polymorphisms present in the major bacterial surface protein, outer-membrane protein a (ompa), on host infection outcomes. tsetse were successfully superinfected with their mutualistic facultative symbiont, sodalis glossinidius, whereas infections with escherichia coli k12 were lethal. in contrast, tsetse were resistant to an e. coli ompa mutant strain, whereas recombinant sodalis expressing e. coli ompa became pathogenic. profiling  of tsetse immunity-related gene expression incriminated peptidoglycan recognition protein (pgrp)-lb as a determinant of the infection outcomes we observed. rnai-induced knockdown of tsetse pgrp-lb significantly reduced host mortality after infection with otherwise lethal e. coli k12. our results show that polymorphisms in the exposed loop domains of ompa represent a microbial adaptation that mediates host tolerance of endogenous symbiotic bacteria.

TI  == an antimicrobial peptide with trypanocidal activity characterized from glossina morsitans morsitans.
AB  == tsetse flies (diptera:glossinidae) are vectors of african trypanosomes, the protozoan agents of devastating diseases in humans and animals. prior studies in  trypanosome infected glossina morsitans morsitans have shown induced expression and synthesis of several antimicrobial peptides in fat body tissue. here, we have expressed one of these peptides, attacin (gmatta1) in drosophila (s2) cells in vitro. we show that the purified recombinant protein (recgmatta1) has strong antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli-k12, but not against the enteric  gram-negative symbiont of tsetse, sodalis glossinidius. the recgmatta1 also demonstrated inhibitory effects against both the mammalian bloodstream form and the insect stage trypanosoma brucei in vitro (minimal inhibitory concentration mic50 0.075 microm). when blood meals were supplemented with purified recgmatta1  during the course of parasite infection, the prevalence of trypanosome infections in tsetse midgut was significantly reduced. feeding fertile females gmatta1 did not affect the fecundity or the longevity of mothers, nor did it affect the hatchability of their offspring. we discuss a paratransgenic strategy, which involves the expression of trypanocidal molecules such as recgmatta1 in the midgut symbiont sodalis in vivo to reduce trypanosome transmission.

TI  == comparative genomics of insect-symbiotic bacteria: influence of host environment  on microbial genome composition.
AB  == commensal symbionts, thought to be intermediary amid obligate mutualists and facultative parasites, offer insight into forces driving the evolutionary transition into mutualism. using macroarrays developed for a close relative, escherichia coli, we utilized a heterologous array hybridization approach to infer the genomic compositions of a clade of bacteria that have recently established symbiotic associations: sodalis glossinidius with the tsetse fly (diptera, glossina spp.) and sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (sope) with the rice weevil (coleoptera, sitophilus oryzae). functional biologies within their hosts currently reflect different forms of symbiotic associations. their hosts, members of distant insect taxa, occupy distinct ecological niches and have evolved to survive on restricted diets of blood for tsetse and cereal for the rice weevil. comparison of genome contents between the two microbes indicates statistically significant differences in the retention of genes involved in carbon compound catabolism, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and transport. the greatest reductions have occurred in carbon catabolism, membrane proteins, and cell structure-related genes for sodalis and in genes involved in cellular processes (i.e., adaptations towards cellular conditions) for sope. modifications in metabolic pathways, in the form of functional losses complementing particularities in host physiology and ecology, may have occurred upon initial entry from a free-living to a symbiotic state. it is possible that these adaptations, streamlining genomes, act to make a free-living state no longer feasible for the harnessed microbe.

TI  == genome size determination and coding capacity of sodalis glossinidius, an enteric symbiont of tsetse flies, as revealed by hybridization to escherichia coli gene arrays.
AB  == recent molecular characterization of various microbial genomes has revealed differences in genome size and coding capacity between obligate symbionts and intracellular pathogens versus free-living organisms. multiple symbiotic microorganisms have evolved with tsetse fly, the vector of african trypanosomes,  over long evolutionary times. although these symbionts are indispensable for tsetse fecundity, the biochemical and molecular basis of their functional significance is unknown. here, we report on the genomic aspects of the secondary  symbiont sodalis glossinidius. the genome size of sodalis is approximately 2 mb.  its dna is subject to extensive methylation and based on some of its conserved gene sequences has an a+t content of only 45%, compared to the typically at-rich  genomes of endosymbionts. sodalis also harbors an extrachromosomal plasmid about  134 kb in size. we used a novel approach to gain insight into sodalis genomic contents, i.e., hybridizing its dna to macroarrays developed for escherichia coli, a closely related enteric bacterium. in this analysis we detected 1,800 orthologous genes, corresponding to about 85% of the sodalis genome. the sodalis  genome has apparently retained its genes for dna replication, transcription, translation, transport, and the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleic acids, vitamins, and cofactors. however, many genes involved in energy metabolism and carbon compound assimilation are apparently missing, which may indicate an adaptation to the energy sources available in the only nutrient of the tsetse host, blood. we present gene arrays as a rapid tool for comparative genomics in the absence of whole genome sequence to advance our understanding of closely related bacteria.
